1,1,1,"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."
1,1,2,"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness  was  upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
1,1,3,"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
1,1,4,"And God saw the light, that  it was  good: and God divided the light from the darkness."
1,1,5,"And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day."
1,1,6,"And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
1,1,7,"And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which  were  under the firmament from the waters which  were  above the firmament: and it was so."
1,1,8,"And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day."
1,1,9,"And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry  land  appear: and it was so."
1,1,10,"And God called the dry  land  Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that  it was  good."
1,1,11,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed,  and  the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed  is  in itself, upon the earth: and it was so."
1,1,12,"And the earth brought forth grass,  and  herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed  was  in itself, after his kind: and God saw that  it was  good."
1,1,13,"And the evening and the morning were the third day."
1,1,14,"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:"
1,1,15,"And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so."
1,1,16,"And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night:  he made  the stars also."
1,1,17,"And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,"
1,1,18,"And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that  it was  good."
1,1,19,"And the evening and the morning were the fourth day."
1,1,20,"And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl  that  may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."
1,1,21,"And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that  it was  good."
1,1,22,"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."
1,1,23,"And the evening and the morning were the fifth day."
1,1,24,"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so."
1,1,25,"And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that  it was  good."
1,1,26,"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
1,1,27,"So God created man in his  own  image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
1,1,28,"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
1,1,29,"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which  is  upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which  is  the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat."
1,1,30,"And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein  there is  life,  I have given  every green herb for meat: and it was so."
1,1,31,"And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold,  it was  very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."
1,2,1,"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."
1,2,2,"And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made."
1,2,3,"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."

1,2,11,"The name of the first  is  Pison: that  is  it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where  there is  gold;"
1,2,12,"And the gold of that land  is  good: there  is  bdellium and the onyx stone."
1,2,13,"And the name of the second river  is  Gihon: the same  is  it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia."
1,2,14,"And the name of the third river  is  Hiddekel: that  is  it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river  is  Euphrates."
1,2,15,"And the"

1,2,24,"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
1,2,25,"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
1,3,1,"Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the"
1,3,2,"And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:"
1,3,3,"But of the fruit of the tree which  is  in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
1,3,4,"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:"
1,3,5,"For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."
1,3,6,"And when the woman saw that the tree  was  good for food, and that it  was  pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make  one  wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat."
1,3,7,"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they  were  naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons."
1,3,8,"And they heard the voice of the"
1,3,9,"And the"
1,3,10,"And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I  was  naked; and I hid myself."
1,3,11,"And he said, Who told thee that thou  wast  naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?"
1,3,12,"And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest  to be  with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat."
1,3,13,"And the"
1,3,14,"And the"
1,3,15,"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
1,3,16,"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire  shall be  to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."
1,3,17,"And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed  is  the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat  of  it all the days of thy life;"
1,3,18,"Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;"
1,3,19,"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou  art , and unto dust shalt thou return."

1,4,19,"And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one  was  Adah, and the name of the other Zillah."
1,4,20,"And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and  of such as have  cattle."
1,4,21,"And his brother’s name  was  Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ."
1,4,22,"And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain  was  Naamah."
1,4,23,"And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt."
1,4,24,"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold."

1,7,15,"And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein  is  the breath of life."
1,7,16,"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the"
1,7,17,"And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth."
1,7,18,"And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters."
1,7,19,"And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that  were  under the whole heaven, were covered."
1,7,20,"Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered."
1,7,21,"And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:"
1,7,22,"All in whose nostrils  was  the breath of life, of all that  was  in the dry  land , died."
1,7,23,"And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained  alive , and they that  were  with him in the ark."
1,7,24,"And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days."
1,8,1,"And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that  was  with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;"
1,8,2,"The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;"
1,8,3,"And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated."
1,8,4,"And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
1,8,5,"And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth  month , on the first  day  of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen."
1,8,6,"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:"
1,8,7,"And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth."
1,8,8,"Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;"
1,8,9,"But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters  were  on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark."
1,8,10,"And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;"
1,8,11,"And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth  was  an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth."
1,8,12,"And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more."
1,8,13,"And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first  month , the first  day  of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry."
1,8,14,"And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried."
1,8,15,"And God spake unto Noah, saying,"
1,8,16,"Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee."
1,8,17,"Bring forth with thee every living thing that  is  with thee, of all flesh,  both  of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth."
1,8,18,"And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:"
1,8,19,"Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl,  and  whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark."
1,8,20,"And Noah builded an altar unto the"
1,8,21,"And the"
1,8,22,"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
1,9,1,"And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth."
1,9,2,"And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth  upon  the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered."
1,9,3,"Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things."
1,9,4,"But flesh with the life thereof,  which is  the blood thereof, shall ye not eat."
1,9,5,"And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man."
1,9,6,"Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man."
1,9,7,"And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein."
1,9,8,"And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,"
1,9,9,"And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;"
1,9,10,"And with every living creature that  is  with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth."
1,9,11,"And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth."
1,9,12,"And God said, This  is  the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that  is  with you, for perpetual generations:"
1,9,13,"I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth."
1,9,14,"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:"
1,9,15,"And I will remember my covenant, which  is  between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh."
1,9,16,"And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that  is  upon the earth."
1,9,17,"And God said unto Noah, This  is  the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that  is  upon the earth."
1,9,18,"And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham  is  the father of Canaan."
1,9,19,"These  are  the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread."
1,9,20,"And Noah began  to be  an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:"
1,9,21,"And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent."
1,9,22,"And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without."
1,9,23,"And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid  it  upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces  were  backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness."
1,9,24,"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him."
1,9,25,"And he said, Cursed  be  Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren."
1,9,26,"And he said, Blessed  be  the"
1,9,27,"God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."
1,9,28,"And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years."
1,9,29,"And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died."
1,10,1,"Now these  are  the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood."
1,10,2,"The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras."
1,10,3,"And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah."
1,10,4,"And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim."
1,10,5,"By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations."
1,10,6,"And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan."
1,10,7,"And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan."
1,10,8,"And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth."
1,10,9,"He was a mighty hunter before the"
1,10,10,"And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."
1,10,11,"Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,"
1,10,12,"And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same  is  a great city."
1,10,13,"And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,"
1,10,14,"And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim."
1,10,15,"And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,"
1,10,16,"And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,"
1,10,17,"And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,"
1,10,18,"And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad."
1,10,19,"And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha."
1,10,20,"These  are  the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries,  and  in their nations."
1,10,21,"Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were  children  born."
1,10,22,"The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram."
1,10,23,"And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash."
1,10,24,"And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber."
1,10,25,"And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one  was  Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name  was  Joktan."
1,10,26,"And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,"
1,10,27,"And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,"
1,10,28,"And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,"
1,10,29,"And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these  were  the sons of Joktan."
1,10,30,"And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east."
1,10,31,"These  are  the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations."
1,10,32,"These  are  the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood."
1,11,1,"And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech."
1,11,2,"And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there."
1,11,3,"And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter."
1,11,4,"And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top  may reach  unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
1,11,5,"And the"
1,11,6,"And the"
1,11,7,"Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech."
1,11,8,"So the"
1,11,9,"Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the"
1,11,10,"These  are  the generations of Shem: Shem  was  an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:"
1,11,11,"And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,12,"And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:"
1,11,13,"And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,14,"And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:"
1,11,15,"And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,16,"And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:"
1,11,17,"And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,18,"And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:"
1,11,19,"And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,20,"And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:"
1,11,21,"And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,22,"And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:"
1,11,23,"And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,24,"And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:"
1,11,25,"And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters."
1,11,26,"And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran."
1,11,27,"Now these  are  the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot."
1,11,28,"And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees."
1,11,29,"And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife  was  Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah."
1,11,30,"But Sarai was barren; she  had  no child."
1,11,31,"And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there."
1,11,32,"And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran."
1,12,1,"Now the"
1,12,2,"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:"
1,12,3,"And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."
1,12,4,"So Abram departed, as the"
1,12,5,"And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came."
1,12,6,"And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite  was  then in the land."
1,12,7,"And the"
1,12,8,"And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent,  having  Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the"
1,12,9,"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south."
1,12,10,"And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine  was  grievous in the land."
1,12,11,"And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou  art  a fair woman to look upon:"
1,12,12,"Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This  is  his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive."
1,12,13,"Say, I pray thee, thou  art  my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee."
1,12,14,"And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she  was  very fair."
1,12,15,"The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house."
1,12,16,"And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels."
1,12,17,"And the"
1,12,18,"And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What  is  this  that  thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she  was  thy wife?"
1,12,19,"Why saidst thou, She  is  my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take  her , and go thy way."
1,12,20,"And Pharaoh commanded  his  men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had."
1,13,1,"And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south."
1,13,2,"And Abram  was  very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold."
1,13,3,"And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;"
1,13,4,"Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the"
1,13,5,"And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents."
1,13,6,"And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together."
1,13,7,"And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land."
1,13,8,"And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we  be  brethren."
1,13,9,"Is  not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if  thou wilt take  the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if  thou depart  to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
1,13,10,"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it  was  well watered every where, before the"
1,13,11,"Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other."
1,13,12,"Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched  his  tent toward Sodom."
1,13,13,"But the men of Sodom  were  wicked and sinners before the"
1,13,14,"And the"
1,13,15,"For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever."
1,13,16,"And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth,  then  shall thy seed also be numbered."
1,13,17,"Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee."
1,13,18,"Then Abram removed  his  tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which  is  in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the"
1,14,1,"And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;"
1,14,2,"That these  made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar."
1,14,3,"All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea."
1,14,4,"Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled."
1,14,5,"And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that  were  with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,"
1,14,6,"And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which  is  by the wilderness."
1,14,7,"And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which  is  Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar."
1,14,8,"And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same  is  Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;"
1,14,9,"With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five."
1,14,10,"And the vale of Siddim  was full of  slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain."
1,14,11,"And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way."
1,14,12,"And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed."
1,14,13,"And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these  were  confederate with Abram."
1,14,14,"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained  servants , born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued  them  unto Dan."
1,14,15,"And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which  is  on the left hand of Damascus."
1,14,16,"And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people."
1,14,17,"And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that  were  with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which  is  the king’s dale."
1,14,18,"And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he  was  the priest of the most high God."
1,14,19,"And he blessed him, and said, Blessed  be  Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:"
1,14,20,"And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all."
1,14,21,"And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself."
1,14,22,"And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the"
1,14,23,"That I will not  take  from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that  is  thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:"
1,14,24,"Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion."
1,15,1,"After these things the word of the"
1,15,2,"And Abram said, Lord"
1,15,3,"And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir."
1,15,4,"And, behold, the word of the"
1,15,5,"And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be."
1,15,6,"And he believed in the"
1,15,7,"And he said unto him, I  am  the"
1,15,8,"And he said, Lord"
1,15,9,"And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
1,15,10,"And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not."
1,15,11,"And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away."
1,15,12,"And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him."
1,15,13,"And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land  that is  not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;"
1,15,14,"And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance."
1,15,15,"And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age."
1,15,16,"But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites  is  not yet full."
1,15,17,"And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces."
1,15,18,"In the same day the"
1,15,19,"The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,"
1,15,20,"And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,"
1,15,21,"And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
1,16,1,"Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name  was  Hagar."
1,16,2,"And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the"
1,16,3,"And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife."
1,16,4,"And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes."
1,16,5,"And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong  be  upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the"
1,16,6,"But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid  is  in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face."
1,16,7,"And the angel of the"
1,16,8,"And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai."
1,16,9,"And the angel of the"
1,16,10,"And the angel of the"
1,16,11,"And the angel of the"
1,16,12,"And he will be a wild man; his hand  will be  against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren."
1,16,13,"And she called the name of the"
1,16,14,"Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,  it is  between Kadesh and Bered."
1,16,15,"And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael."
1,16,16,"And Abram  was  fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram."
1,17,1,"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the"
1,17,2,"And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly."
1,17,3,"And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,"
1,17,4,"As for me, behold, my covenant  is  with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations."
1,17,5,"Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee."
1,17,6,"And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee."
1,17,7,"And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee."
1,17,8,"And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God."
1,17,9,"And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations."
1,17,10,"This  is  my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised."
1,17,11,"And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you."
1,17,12,"And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which  is  not of thy seed."
1,17,13,"He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant."
1,17,14,"And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant."
1,17,15,"And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah  shall  her name  be ."
1,17,16,"And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be  a mother  of nations; kings of people shall be of her."
1,17,17,"Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall  a child  be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?"
1,17,18,"And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!"
1,17,19,"And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant,  and  with his seed after him."
1,17,20,"And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
1,17,21,"But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year."
1,17,22,"And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."
1,17,23,"And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him."
1,17,24,"And Abraham  was  ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
1,17,25,"And Ishmael his son  was  thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin."
1,17,26,"In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son."
1,17,27,"And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him."
1,18,1,"And the"
1,18,2,"And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw  them , he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,"
1,18,3,"And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:"
1,18,4,"Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:"
1,18,5,"And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said."
1,18,6,"And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead  it , and make cakes upon the hearth."
1,18,7,"And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave  it  unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it."
1,18,8,"And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set  it  before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat."
1,18,9,"And they said unto him, Where  is  Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent."
1,18,10,"And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard  it  in the tent door, which  was  behind him."
1,18,11,"Now Abraham and Sarah  were  old  and  well stricken in age;  and  it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women."
1,18,12,"Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
1,18,13,"And the"
1,18,14,"Is any thing too hard for the"
1,18,15,"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh."
1,18,16,"And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way."
1,18,17,"And the"
1,18,18,"Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?"
1,18,19,"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the"
1,18,20,"And the"
1,18,21,"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know."
1,18,22,"And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the"
1,18,23,"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?"
1,18,24,"Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that  are  therein?"
1,18,25,"That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
1,18,26,"And the"
1,18,27,"And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which  am but  dust and ashes:"
1,18,28,"Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for  lack of  five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy  it ."
1,18,29,"And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do  it  for forty’s sake."
1,18,30,"And he said  unto him , Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do  it , if I find thirty there."
1,18,31,"And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy  it  for twenty’s sake."
1,18,32,"And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy  it  for ten’s sake."
1,18,33,"And the"
1,19,1,"And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing  them  rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;"
1,19,2,"And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night."
1,19,3,"And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat."
1,19,4,"But before they lay down, the men of the city,  even  the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:"
1,19,5,"And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where  are  the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them."
1,19,6,"And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,"
1,19,7,"And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly."
1,19,8,"Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as  is  good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof."
1,19,9,"And they said, Stand back. And they said  again , This one  fellow  came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,  even  Lot, and came near to break the door."
1,19,10,"But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door."
1,19,11,"And they smote the men that  were  at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door."
1,19,12,"And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring  them  out of this place:"
1,19,13,"For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the"
1,19,14,"And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the"
1,19,15,"And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
1,19,16,"And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the"
1,19,17,"And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."
1,19,18,"And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:"
1,19,19,"Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:"
1,19,20,"Behold now, this city  is  near to flee unto, and it  is  a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, ( is  it not a little one?) and my soul shall live."
1,19,21,"And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken."
1,19,22,"Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar."
1,19,23,"The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar."
1,19,24,"Then the"
1,19,25,"And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground."
1,19,26,"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."
1,19,27,"And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the"
1,19,28,"And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace."
1,19,29,"And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt."
1,19,30,"And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters."
1,19,31,"And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father  is  old, and  there is  not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:"
1,19,32,"Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
1,19,33,"And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
1,19,34,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,  and  lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father."
1,19,35,"And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose."
1,19,36,"Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father."
1,19,37,"And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same  is  the father of the Moabites unto this day."
1,19,38,"And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same  is  the father of the children of Ammon unto this day."
1,20,1,"And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar."
1,20,2,"And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She  is  my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah."
1,20,3,"But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou  art but  a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she  is  a man’s wife."
1,20,4,"But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?"
1,20,5,"Said he not unto me, She  is  my sister? and she, even she herself said, He  is  my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this."
1,20,6,"And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her."
1,20,7,"Now therefore restore the man  his  wife; for he  is  a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore  her  not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that  are  thine."
1,20,8,"Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid."
1,20,9,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done."
1,20,10,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?"
1,20,11,"And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God  is  not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake."
1,20,12,"And yet indeed  she is  my sister; she  is  the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."
1,20,13,"And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This  is  thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He  is  my brother."
1,20,14,"And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave  them  unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife."
1,20,15,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land  is  before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee."
1,20,16,"And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand  pieces  of silver: behold, he  is  to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that  are  with thee, and with all  other : thus she was reproved."
1,20,17,"So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare  children ."
1,20,18,"For the"
1,21,1,"And the"
1,21,2,"For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
1,21,3,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac."
1,21,4,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him."
1,21,5,"And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him."
1,21,6,"And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh,  so that  all that hear will laugh with me."
1,21,7,"And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born  him  a son in his old age."
1,21,8,"And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the  same  day that Isaac was weaned."
1,21,9,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking."
1,21,10,"Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son,  even  with Isaac."
1,21,11,"And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son."
1,21,12,"And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called."
1,21,13,"And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he  is  thy seed."
1,21,14,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave  it  unto Hagar, putting  it  on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba."
1,21,15,"And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."
1,21,16,"And she went, and sat her down over against  him  a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against  him , and lift up her voice, and wept."
1,21,17,"And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he  is ."
1,21,18,"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation."
1,21,19,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink."
1,21,20,"And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer."
1,21,21,"And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt."
1,21,22,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God  is  with thee in all that thou doest:"
1,21,23,"Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son:  but  according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned."
1,21,24,"And Abraham said, I will swear."
1,21,25,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away."
1,21,26,"And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I  of it , but to day."
1,21,27,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant."
1,21,28,"And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves."
1,21,29,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What  mean  these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?"
1,21,30,"And he said, For  these  seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well."
1,21,31,"Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them."
1,21,32,"Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines."
1,21,33,"And  Abraham  planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the"
1,21,34,"And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days."
1,22,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold,  here  I  am ."
1,22,2,"And he said, Take now thy son, thine only  son  Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."
1,22,3,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him."
1,22,4,"Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off."
1,22,5,"And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you."
1,22,6,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid  it  upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together."
1,22,7,"And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here  am  I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where  is  the lamb for a burnt offering?"
1,22,8,"And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together."
1,22,9,"And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."
1,22,10,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son."
1,22,11,"And the angel of the"
1,22,12,"And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only  son  from me."
1,22,13,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind  him  a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son."
1,22,14,"And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said  to  this day, In the mount of the"
1,22,15,"And the angel of the"
1,22,16,"And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the"
1,22,17,"That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which  is  upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;"
1,22,18,"And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice."
1,22,19,"So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba."
1,22,20,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;"
1,22,21,"Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,"
1,22,22,"And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
1,22,23,"And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother."
1,22,24,"And his concubine, whose name  was  Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah."
1,23,1,"And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old:  these were  the years of the life of Sarah."
1,23,2,"And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same  is  Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."
1,23,3,"And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,"
1,23,4,"I  am  a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
1,23,5,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
1,23,6,"Hear us, my lord: thou  art  a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead."
1,23,7,"And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,  even  to the children of Heth."
1,23,8,"And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,"
1,23,9,"That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which  is  in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you."
1,23,10,"And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth,  even  of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,"
1,23,11,"Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that  is  therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead."
1,23,12,"And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land."
1,23,13,"And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou  wilt give it , I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take  it  of me, and I will bury my dead there."
1,23,14,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
1,23,15,"My lord, hearken unto me: the land  is worth  four hundred shekels of silver; what  is  that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead."
1,23,16,"And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current  money  with the merchant."
1,23,17,"And the field of Ephron, which  was  in Machpelah, which  was  before Mamre, the field, and the cave which  was  therein, and all the trees that  were  in the field, that  were  in all the borders round about, were made sure"
1,23,18,"Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city."
1,23,19,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same  is  Hebron in the land of Canaan."
1,23,20,"And the field, and the cave that  is  therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth."
1,24,1,"And Abraham was old,  and  well stricken in age: and the"
1,24,2,"And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:"
1,24,3,"And I will make thee swear by the"
1,24,4,"But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac."
1,24,5,"And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?"
1,24,6,"And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again."
1,24,7,"The"
1,24,8,"And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again."
1,24,9,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter."
1,24,10,"And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master  were  in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor."
1,24,11,"And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening,  even  the time that women go out to draw  water ."
1,24,12,"And he said, O"
1,24,13,"Behold, I stand  here  by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:"
1,24,14,"And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also:  let the same be  she  that  thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master."
1,24,15,"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder."
1,24,16,"And the damsel  was  very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up."
1,24,17,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher."
1,24,18,"And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink."
1,24,19,"And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw  water  for thy camels also, until they have done drinking."
1,24,20,"And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw  water , and drew for all his camels."
1,24,21,"And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the"
1,24,22,"And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten  shekels  weight of gold;"
1,24,23,"And said, Whose daughter  art  thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room  in  thy father’s house for us to lodge in?"
1,24,24,"And she said unto him, I  am  the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor."
1,24,25,"She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in."
1,24,26,"And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the"
1,24,27,"And he said, Blessed  be  the"
1,24,28,"And the damsel ran, and told  them of  her mother’s house these things."
1,24,29,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name  was  Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well."
1,24,30,"And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well."
1,24,31,"And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the"
1,24,32,"And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men’s feet that  were  with him."
1,24,33,"And there was set  meat  before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on."
1,24,34,"And he said, I  am  Abraham’s servant."
1,24,35,"And the"
1,24,36,"And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath."
1,24,37,"And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:"
1,24,38,"But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son."
1,24,39,"And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me."
1,24,40,"And he said unto me, The"
1,24,41,"Then shalt thou be clear from  this  my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee  one , thou shalt be clear from my oath."
1,24,42,"And I came this day unto the well, and said, O"
1,24,43,"Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw  water , and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;"
1,24,44,"And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels:  let  the same  be  the woman whom the"
1,24,45,"And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew  water : and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee."
1,24,46,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her  shoulder , and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also."
1,24,47,"And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter  art  thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands."
1,24,48,"And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the"
1,24,49,"And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
1,24,50,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the"
1,24,51,"Behold, Rebekah  is  before thee, take  her , and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the"
1,24,52,"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the"
1,24,53,"And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave  them  to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things."
1,24,54,"And they did eat and drink, he and the men that  were  with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master."
1,24,55,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us  a few  days, at the least ten; after that she shall go."
1,24,56,"And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the"
1,24,57,"And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth."
1,24,58,"And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go."
1,24,59,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men."
1,24,60,"And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou  art  our sister, be thou  the mother  of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them."
1,24,61,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way."
1,24,62,"And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country."
1,24,63,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels  were  coming."
1,24,64,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel."
1,24,65,"For she  had  said unto the servant, What man  is  this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant  had  said, It  is  my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself."
1,24,66,"And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done."
1,24,67,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s  death ."
1,25,1,"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name  was  Keturah."
1,25,2,"And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
1,25,3,"And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim."
1,25,4,"And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these  were  the children of Keturah."
1,25,5,"And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac."
1,25,6,"But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country."
1,25,7,"And these  are  the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years."
1,25,8,"Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full  of years ; and was gathered to his people."
1,25,9,"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which  is  before Mamre;"
1,25,10,"The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife."
1,25,11,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi."
1,25,12,"Now these  are  the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:"
1,25,13,"And these  are  the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,"
1,25,14,"And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
1,25,15,"Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:"
1,25,16,"These  are  the sons of Ishmael, and these  are  their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations."
1,25,17,"And these  are  the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people."
1,25,18,"And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that  is  before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria:  and  he died in the presence of all his brethren."
1,25,19,"And these  are  the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:"
1,25,20,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian."
1,25,21,"And Isaac intreated the"
1,25,22,"And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If  it be  so, why  am  I thus? And she went to inquire of the"
1,25,23,"And the"
1,25,24,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,  there were  twins in her womb."
1,25,25,"And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau."
1,25,26,"And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac  was  threescore years old when she bare them."
1,25,27,"And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob  was  a plain man, dwelling in tents."
1,25,28,"And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of  his  venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob."
1,25,29,"And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he  was  faint:"
1,25,30,"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red  pottage ; for I  am  faint: therefore was his name called Edom."
1,25,31,"And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright."
1,25,32,"And Esau said, Behold, I  am  at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?"
1,25,33,"And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob."
1,25,34,"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised  his  birthright."
1,26,1,"And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar."
1,26,2,"And the"
1,26,3,"Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;"
1,26,4,"And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;"
1,26,5,"Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
1,26,6,"And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:"
1,26,7,"And the men of the place asked  him  of his wife; and he said, She  is  my sister: for he feared to say,  She is  my wife; lest,  said he , the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she  was  fair to look upon."
1,26,8,"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac  was  sporting with Rebekah his wife."
1,26,9,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she  is  thy wife: and how saidst thou, She  is  my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her."
1,26,10,"And Abimelech said, What  is  this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us."
1,26,11,"And Abimelech charged all  his  people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
1,26,12,"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the"
1,26,13,"And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:"
1,26,14,"For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him."
1,26,15,"For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth."
1,26,16,"And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we."
1,26,17,"And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
1,26,18,"And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them."
1,26,19,"And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water."
1,26,20,"And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water  is  ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him."
1,26,21,"And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah."
1,26,22,"And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the"
1,26,23,"And he went up from thence to Beersheba."
1,26,24,"And the"
1,26,25,"And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the"
1,26,26,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army."
1,26,27,"And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
1,26,28,"And they said, We saw certainly that the"
1,26,29,"That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou  art  now the blessed of the"
1,26,30,"And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink."
1,26,31,"And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
1,26,32,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water."
1,26,33,"And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city  is  Beersheba unto this day."
1,26,34,"And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:"
1,26,35,"Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah."
1,27,1,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,  here am  I."
1,27,2,"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:"
1,27,3,"Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me  some  venison;"
1,27,4,"And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring  it  to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die."
1,27,5,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt  for  venison,  and  to bring  it ."
1,27,6,"And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,"
1,27,7,"Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the"
1,27,8,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee."
1,27,9,"Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:"
1,27,10,"And thou shalt bring  it  to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death."
1,27,11,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother  is  a hairy man, and I  am  a smooth man:"
1,27,12,"My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing."
1,27,13,"And his mother said unto him, Upon me  be  thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me  them ."
1,27,14,"And he went, and fetched, and brought  them  to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved."
1,27,15,"And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which  were  with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:"
1,27,16,"And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:"
1,27,17,"And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
1,27,18,"And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here  am  I; who  art  thou, my son?"
1,27,19,"And Jacob said unto his father, I  am  Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me."
1,27,20,"And Isaac said unto his son, How  is it  that thou hast found  it  so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the"
1,27,21,"And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou  be  my very son Esau or not."
1,27,22,"And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice  is  Jacob’s voice, but the hands  are  the hands of Esau."
1,27,23,"And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him."
1,27,24,"And he said,  Art  thou my very son Esau? And he said, I  am ."
1,27,25,"And he said, Bring  it  near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought  it  near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank."
1,27,26,"And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
1,27,27,"And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son  is  as the smell of a field which the"
1,27,28,"Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:"
1,27,29,"Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed  be  every one that curseth thee, and blessed  be  he that blesseth thee."
1,27,30,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
1,27,31,"And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me."
1,27,32,"And Isaac his father said unto him, Who  art  thou? And he said, I  am  thy son, thy firstborn Esau."
1,27,33,"And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where  is  he that hath taken venison, and brought  it  me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,  and  he shall be blessed."
1,27,34,"And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,  even  me also, O my father."
1,27,35,"And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing."
1,27,36,"And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?"
1,27,37,"And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?"
1,27,38,"And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me,  even  me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept."
1,27,39,"And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;"
1,27,40,"And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck."
1,27,41,"And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob."
1,27,42,"And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself,  purposing  to kill thee."
1,27,43,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;"
1,27,44,"And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away;"
1,27,45,"Until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget  that  which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?"
1,27,46,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these  which are  of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?"
1,28,1,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
1,28,2,"Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother."
1,28,3,"And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;"
1,28,4,"And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham."
1,28,5,"And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother."
1,28,6,"When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;"
1,28,7,"And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;"
1,28,8,"And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;"
1,28,9,"Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife."
1,28,10,"And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran."
1,28,11,"And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put  them for  his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep."
1,28,12,"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
1,28,13,"And, behold, the"
1,28,14,"And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
1,28,15,"And, behold, I  am  with thee, and will keep thee in all  places  whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done  that  which I have spoken to thee of."
1,28,16,"And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the"
1,28,17,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful  is  this place! this  is  none other but the house of God, and this  is  the gate of heaven."
1,28,18,"And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put  for  his pillows, and set it up  for  a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it."
1,28,19,"And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city  was called  Luz at the first."
1,28,20,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,"
1,28,21,"So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the"
1,28,22,"And this stone, which I have set  for  a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee."
1,29,1,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east."
1,29,2,"And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there  were  three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone  was  upon the well’s mouth."
1,29,3,"And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in his place."
1,29,4,"And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence  be  ye? And they said, Of Haran  are  we."
1,29,5,"And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know  him ."
1,29,6,"And he said unto them,  Is  he well? And they said,  He is  well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep."
1,29,7,"And he said, Lo,  it is  yet high day, neither  is it  time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go  and  feed  them ."
1,29,8,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and  till  they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep."
1,29,9,"And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep: for she kept them."
1,29,10,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother."
1,29,11,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept."
1,29,12,"And Jacob told Rachel that he  was  her father’s brother, and that he  was  Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father."
1,29,13,"And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things."
1,29,14,"And Laban said to him, Surely thou  art  my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month."
1,29,15,"And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou  art  my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what  shall  thy wages  be ?"
1,29,16,"And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder  was  Leah, and the name of the younger  was  Rachel."
1,29,17,"Leah  was  tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured."
1,29,18,"And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter."
1,29,19,"And Laban said,  It is  better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me."
1,29,20,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him  but  a few days, for the love he had to her."
1,29,21,"And Jacob said unto Laban, Give  me  my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her."
1,29,22,"And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast."
1,29,23,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her."
1,29,24,"And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid  for  an handmaid."
1,29,25,"And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it  was  Leah: and he said to Laban, What  is  this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?"
1,29,26,"And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn."
1,29,27,"Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years."
1,29,28,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also."
1,29,29,"And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid."
1,29,30,"And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years."
1,29,31,"And when the"
1,29,32,"And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the"
1,29,33,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the"
1,29,34,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi."
1,29,35,"And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the"
1,30,1,"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die."
1,30,2,"And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said,  Am  I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"
1,30,3,"And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her."
1,30,4,"And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her."
1,30,5,"And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son."
1,30,6,"And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan."
1,30,7,"And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son."
1,30,8,"And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali."
1,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife."
1,30,10,"And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a son."
1,30,11,"And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad."
1,30,12,"And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a second son."
1,30,13,"And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher."
1,30,14,"And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes."
1,30,15,"And she said unto her,  Is it  a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son’s mandrakes."
1,30,16,"And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night."
1,30,17,"And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son."
1,30,18,"And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar."
1,30,19,"And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son."
1,30,20,"And Leah said, God hath endued me  with  a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun."
1,30,21,"And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
1,30,22,"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb."
1,30,23,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:"
1,30,24,"And she called his name Joseph; and said, The"
1,30,25,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country."
1,30,26,"Give  me  my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee."
1,30,27,"And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes,  tarry: for  I have learned by experience that the"
1,30,28,"And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give  it ."
1,30,29,"And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me."
1,30,30,"For  it was  little which thou hadst before I  came , and it is  now  increased unto a multitude; and the"
1,30,31,"And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed  and  keep thy flock:"
1,30,32,"I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and  of such  shall be my hire."
1,30,33,"So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that  is  not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me."
1,30,34,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word."
1,30,35,"And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,  and  every one that had  some  white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave  them  into the hand of his sons."
1,30,36,"And he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks."
1,30,37,"And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which  was  in the rods."
1,30,38,"And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink."
1,30,39,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted."
1,30,40,"And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban’s cattle."
1,30,41,"And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods."
1,30,42,"But when the cattle were feeble, he put  them  not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s."
1,30,43,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses."
1,31,1,"And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that  was  our father’s; and of  that  which  was  our father’s hath he gotten all this glory."
1,31,2,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it  was  not toward him as before."
1,31,3,"And the"
1,31,4,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,"
1,31,5,"And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it  is  not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me."
1,31,6,"And ye know that with all my power I have served your father."
1,31,7,"And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me."
1,31,8,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked."
1,31,9,"Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given  them  to me."
1,31,10,"And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle  were  ringstraked, speckled, and grisled."
1,31,11,"And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream,  saying , Jacob: And I said, Here  am  I."
1,31,12,"And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle  are  ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee."
1,31,13,"I  am  the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar,  and  where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred."
1,31,14,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him,  Is there  yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?"
1,31,15,"Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money."
1,31,16,"For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that  is  ours, and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do."
1,31,17,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;"
1,31,18,"And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan."
1,31,19,"And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that  were  her father’s."
1,31,20,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled."
1,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face  toward  the mount Gilead."
1,31,22,"And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled."
1,31,23,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead."
1,31,24,"And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
1,31,25,"Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead."
1,31,26,"And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives  taken  with the sword?"
1,31,27,"Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?"
1,31,28,"And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in  so  doing."
1,31,29,"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
1,31,30,"And now,  though  thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house,  yet  wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?"
1,31,31,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me."
1,31,32,"With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what  is  thine with me, and take  it  to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them."
1,31,33,"And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents; but he found  them  not. Then went he out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent."
1,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found  them  not."
1,31,35,"And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women  is  upon me. And he searched, but found not the images."
1,31,36,"And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What  is  my trespass? what  is  my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?"
1,31,37,"Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set  it  here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both."
1,31,38,"This twenty years  have  I  been  with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten."
1,31,39,"That which was torn  of beasts  I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it,  whether  stolen by day, or stolen by night."
1,31,40,"Thus  I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes."
1,31,41,"Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times."
1,31,42,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked  thee  yesternight."
1,31,43,"And Laban answered and said unto Jacob,  These  daughters  are  my daughters, and  these  children  are  my children, and  these  cattle  are  my cattle, and all that thou seest  is  mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?"
1,31,44,"Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee."
1,31,45,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up  for  a pillar."
1,31,46,"And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap."
1,31,47,"And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed."
1,31,48,"And Laban said, This heap  is  a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;"
1,31,49,"And Mizpah; for he said, The"
1,31,50,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take  other  wives beside my daughters, no man  is  with us; see, God  is  witness betwixt me and thee."
1,31,51,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold  this  pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;"
1,31,52,"This heap  be  witness, and  this  pillar  be  witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm."
1,31,53,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac."
1,31,54,"Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount."
1,31,55,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place."
1,32,1,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
1,32,2,"And when Jacob saw them, he said, This  is  God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
1,32,3,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
1,32,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:"
1,32,5,"And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight."
1,32,6,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."
1,32,7,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that  was  with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;"
1,32,8,"And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape."
1,32,9,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the"
1,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands."
1,32,11,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,  and  the mother with the children."
1,32,12,"And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude."
1,32,13,"And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;"
1,32,14,"Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,"
1,32,15,"Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals."
1,32,16,"And he delivered  them  into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove."
1,32,17,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose  art  thou? and whither goest thou? and whose  are  these before thee?"
1,32,18,"Then thou shalt say,  They be  thy servant Jacob’s; it  is  a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he  is  behind us."
1,32,19,"And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him."
1,32,20,"And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob  is  behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me."
1,32,21,"So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company."
1,32,22,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok."
1,32,23,"And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had."
1,32,24,"And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day."
1,32,25,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him."
1,32,26,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."
1,32,27,"And he said unto him, What  is  thy name? And he said, Jacob."
1,32,28,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed."
1,32,29,"And Jacob asked  him , and said, Tell  me , I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore  is  it  that  thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there."
1,32,30,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
1,32,31,"And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh."
1,32,32,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not  of  the sinew which shrank, which  is  upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank."
1,33,1,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids."
1,33,2,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost."
1,33,3,"And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
1,33,4,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."
1,33,5,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who  are  those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant."
1,33,6,"Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves."
1,33,7,"And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
1,33,8,"And he said, What  meanest  thou by all this drove which I met? And he said,  These are  to find grace in the sight of my lord."
1,33,9,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself."
1,33,10,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me."
1,33,11,"Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took  it ."
1,33,12,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee."
1,33,13,"And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children  are  tender, and the flocks and herds with young  are  with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die."
1,33,14,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir."
1,33,15,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee  some  of the folk that  are  with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord."
1,33,16,"So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir."
1,33,17,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
1,33,18,"And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which  is  in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city."
1,33,19,"And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an hundred pieces of money."
1,33,20,"And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael."
1,34,1,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
1,34,2,"And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her."
1,34,3,"And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel."
1,34,4,"And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife."
1,34,5,"And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come."
1,34,6,"And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him."
1,34,7,"And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard  it : and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which thing ought not to be done."
1,34,8,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife."
1,34,9,"And make ye marriages with us,  and  give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you."
1,34,10,"And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein."
1,34,11,"And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give."
1,34,12,"Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife."
1,34,13,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:"
1,34,14,"And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that  were  a reproach unto us:"
1,34,15,"But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we  be , that every male of you be circumcised;"
1,34,16,"Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
1,34,17,"But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone."
1,34,18,"And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son."
1,34,19,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he  was  more honourable than all the house of his father."
1,34,20,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,"
1,34,21,"These men  are  peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold,  it is  large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters."
1,34,22,"Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they  are  circumcised."
1,34,23,"Shall  not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs  be  ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us."
1,34,24,"And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city."
1,34,25,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males."
1,34,26,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out."
1,34,27,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister."
1,34,28,"They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which  was  in the city, and that which  was  in the field,"
1,34,29,"And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that  was  in the house."
1,34,30,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I  being  few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house."
1,34,31,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?"
1,35,1,"And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother."
1,35,2,"Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that  were  with him, Put away the strange gods that  are  among you, and be clean, and change your garments:"
1,35,3,"And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
1,35,4,"And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which  were  in their hand, and  all their  earrings which  were  in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which  was  by Shechem."
1,35,5,"And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that  were  round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob."
1,35,6,"So Jacob came to Luz, which  is  in the land of Canaan, that  is , Bethel, he and all the people that  were  with him."
1,35,7,"And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
1,35,8,"But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth."
1,35,9,"And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him."
1,35,10,"And God said unto him, Thy name  is  Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel."
1,35,11,"And God said unto him, I  am  God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;"
1,35,12,"And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land."
1,35,13,"And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him."
1,35,14,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,  even  a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon."
1,35,15,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel."
1,35,16,"And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour."
1,35,17,"And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also."
1,35,18,"And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin."
1,35,19,"And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which  is  Bethlehem."
1,35,20,"And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that  is  the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day."
1,35,21,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar."
1,35,22,"And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard  it . Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:"
1,35,23,"The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:"
1,35,24,"The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:"
1,35,25,"And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:"
1,35,26,"And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these  are  the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram."
1,35,27,"And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which  is  Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned."
1,35,28,"And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years."
1,35,29,"And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people,  being  old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
1,36,1,"Now these  are  the generations of Esau, who  is  Edom."
1,36,2,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"

1,36,5,"And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these  are  the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan."
1,36,6,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob."
1,36,7,"For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle."
1,36,8,"Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau  is  Edom."
1,36,9,"And these  are  the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:"
1,36,10,"These  are  the names of Esau’s sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau."
1,36,11,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz."

1,37,1,"And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan."
1,37,2,"These  are  the generations of Jacob. Joseph,  being  seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad  was  with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report."
1,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he  was  the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of  many  colours."
1,37,4,"And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him."
1,37,5,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told  it  his brethren: and they hated him yet the more."
1,37,6,"And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:"
1,37,7,"For, behold, we  were  binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf."
1,37,8,"And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words."
1,37,9,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me."
1,37,10,"And he told  it  to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What  is  this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?"
1,37,11,"And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying."
1,37,12,"And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem."
1,37,13,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed  the flock  in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here  am I ."
1,37,14,"And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
1,37,15,"And a certain man found him, and, behold,  he was  wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?"
1,37,16,"And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed  their flocks ."
1,37,17,"And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan."
1,37,18,"And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him."
1,37,19,"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh."
1,37,20,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams."
1,37,21,"And Reuben heard  it , and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him."
1,37,22,"And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood,  but  cast him into this pit that  is  in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again."
1,37,23,"And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat,  his  coat of  many  colours that  was  on him;"
1,37,24,"And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit  was  empty,  there was  no water in it."
1,37,25,"And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry  it  down to Egypt."
1,37,26,"And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit  is it  if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?"
1,37,27,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he  is  our brother  and  our flesh. And his brethren were content."
1,37,28,"Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty  pieces  of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt."
1,37,29,"And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph  was  not in the pit; and he rent his clothes."
1,37,30,"And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child  is  not; and I, whither shall I go?"
1,37,31,"And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;"
1,37,32,"And they sent the coat of  many  colours, and they brought  it  to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it  be  thy son’s coat or no."
1,37,33,"And he knew it, and said,  It is  my son’s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces."
1,37,34,"And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days."
1,37,35,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him."
1,37,36,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s,  and  captain of the guard."
1,38,1,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name  was  Hirah."
1,38,2,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name  was  Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her."
1,38,3,"And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er."
1,38,4,"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan."
1,38,5,"And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him."
1,38,6,"And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name  was  Tamar."
1,38,7,"And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the"
1,38,8,"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother."
1,38,9,"And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled  it  on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother."
1,38,10,"And the thing which he did displeased the"
1,38,11,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren  did . And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house."
1,38,12,"And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
1,38,13,"And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep."
1,38,14,"And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which  is  by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife."
1,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought her  to be  an harlot; because she had covered her face."
1,38,16,"And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she  was  his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?"
1,38,17,"And he said, I will send  thee  a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give  me  a pledge, till thou send  it ?"
1,38,18,"And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that  is  in thine hand. And he gave  it  her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him."
1,38,19,"And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
1,38,20,"And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive  his  pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not."
1,38,21,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where  is  the harlot, that  was  openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this  place ."
1,38,22,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said,  that  there was no harlot in this  place ."
1,38,23,"And Judah said, Let her take  it  to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her."
1,38,24,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she  is  with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."
1,38,25,"When she  was  brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these  are, am  I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose  are  these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff."
1,38,26,"And Judah acknowledged  them , and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more."
1,38,27,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins  were  in her womb."
1,38,28,"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that  the one  put out  his  hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first."
1,38,29,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth?  this  breach  be  upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez."
1,38,30,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah."
1,39,1,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither."
1,39,2,"And the"
1,39,3,"And his master saw that the"
1,39,4,"And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all  that  he had he put into his hand."
1,39,5,"And it came to pass from the time  that  he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the"
1,39,6,"And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was  a  goodly  person , and well favoured."
1,39,7,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me."
1,39,8,"But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what  is  with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;"
1,39,9,"There is  none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou  art  his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
1,39,10,"And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her,  or  to be with her."
1,39,11,"And it came to pass about this time, that  Joseph  went into the house to do his business; and  there was  none of the men of the house there within."
1,39,12,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out."
1,39,13,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,"
1,39,14,"That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:"
1,39,15,"And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out."
1,39,16,"And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home."
1,39,17,"And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:"
1,39,18,"And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out."
1,39,19,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled."
1,39,20,"And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners  were  bound: and he was there in the prison."
1,39,21,"But the"
1,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that  were  in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer  of it ."
1,39,23,"The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing  that was  under his hand; because the"
1,40,1,"And it came to pass after these things,  that  the butler of the king of Egypt and  his  baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt."
1,40,2,"And Pharaoh was wroth against two  of  his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers."
1,40,3,"And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph  was  bound."
1,40,4,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward."
1,40,5,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which  were  bound in the prison."
1,40,6,"And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they  were  sad."
1,40,7,"And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that  were  with him in the ward of his lord’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye  so  sadly to day?"
1,40,8,"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and  there is  no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them,  Do  not interpretations  belong  to God? tell me  them , I pray you."
1,40,9,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine  was  before me;"
1,40,10,"And in the vine  were  three branches: and it  was  as though it budded,  and  her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:"
1,40,11,"And Pharaoh’s cup  was  in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand."
1,40,12,"And Joseph said unto him, This  is  the interpretation of it: The three branches  are  three days:"
1,40,13,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler."
1,40,14,"But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:"
1,40,15,"For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."
1,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also  was  in my dream, and, behold,  I had  three white baskets on my head:"
1,40,17,"And in the uppermost basket  there was  of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head."
1,40,18,"And Joseph answered and said, This  is  the interpretation thereof: The three baskets  are  three days:"
1,40,19,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee."
1,40,20,"And it came to pass the third day,  which was  Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants."
1,40,21,"And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:"
1,40,22,"But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them."
1,40,23,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him."
1,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river."
1,41,2,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow."
1,41,3,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the  other  kine upon the brink of the river."
1,41,4,"And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke."
1,41,5,"And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good."
1,41,6,"And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them."
1,41,7,"And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold,  it was  a dream."
1,41,8,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but  there was  none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh."
1,41,9,"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:"
1,41,10,"Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house,  both  me and the chief baker:"
1,41,11,"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
1,41,12,"And  there was  there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret."
1,41,13,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged."
1,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved  himself , and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh."
1,41,15,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and  there is  none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee,  that  thou canst understand a dream to interpret it."
1,41,16,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying,  It is  not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
1,41,17,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:"
1,41,18,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:"
1,41,19,"And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:"
1,41,20,"And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:"
1,41,21,"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they  were  still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke."
1,41,22,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:"
1,41,23,"And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,  and  blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:"
1,41,24,"And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told  this  unto the magicians; but  there was  none that could declare  it  to me."
1,41,25,"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh  is  one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he  is  about to do."
1,41,26,"The seven good kine  are  seven years; and the seven good ears  are  seven years: the dream  is  one."
1,41,27,"And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them  are  seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine."
1,41,28,"This  is  the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God  is  about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh."
1,41,29,"Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:"
1,41,30,"And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;"
1,41,31,"And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it  shall be  very grievous."
1,41,32,"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice;  it is  because the thing  is  established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
1,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
1,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do  this , and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years."
1,41,35,"And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities."
1,41,36,"And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine."
1,41,37,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants."
1,41,38,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find  such a one  as this  is , a man in whom the Spirit of God  is ?"
1,41,39,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this,  there is  none so discreet and wise as thou  art :"
1,41,40,"Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou."
1,41,41,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt."
1,41,42,"And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;"
1,41,43,"And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him  ruler  over all the land of Egypt."
1,41,44,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I  am  Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
1,41,45,"And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over  all  the land of Egypt."
1,41,46,"And Joseph  was  thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt."
1,41,47,"And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls."
1,41,48,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which  was  round about every city, laid he up in the same."
1,41,49,"And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for  it was  without number."
1,41,50,"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him."
1,41,51,"And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,  said he , hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house."
1,41,52,"And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction."
1,41,53,"And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended."
1,41,54,"And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
1,41,55,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do."
1,41,56,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt."
1,41,57,"And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy  corn ; because that the famine was  so  sore in all lands."
1,42,1,"Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?"
1,42,2,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die."
1,42,3,"And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt."
1,42,4,"But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him."
1,42,5,"And the sons of Israel came to buy  corn  among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan."
1,42,6,"And Joseph  was  the governor over the land,  and  he  it was  that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him  with  their faces to the earth."
1,42,7,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food."
1,42,8,"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him."
1,42,9,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye  are  spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come."
1,42,10,"And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come."
1,42,11,"We  are  all one man’s sons; we  are  true  men , thy servants are no spies."
1,42,12,"And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come."
1,42,13,"And they said, Thy servants  are  twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest  is  this day with our father, and one  is  not."
1,42,14,"And Joseph said unto them, That  is it  that I spake unto you, saying, Ye  are  spies:"
1,42,15,"Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither."
1,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether  there be any  truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye  are  spies."
1,42,17,"And he put them all together into ward three days."
1,42,18,"And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;  for  I fear God:"
1,42,19,"If ye  be  true  men , let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:"
1,42,20,"But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so."
1,42,21,"And they said one to another, We  are  verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us."
1,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required."
1,42,23,"And they knew not that Joseph understood  them ; for he spake unto them by an interpreter."
1,42,24,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes."
1,42,25,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them."
1,42,26,"And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence."
1,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it  was  in his sack’s mouth."
1,42,28,"And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,  it is  even in my sack: and their heart failed  them , and they were afraid, saying one to another, What  is  this  that  God hath done unto us?"
1,42,29,"And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,"
1,42,30,"The man,  who is  the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country."
1,42,31,"And we said unto him, We  are  true  men ; we are no spies:"
1,42,32,"We  be  twelve brethren, sons of our father; one  is  not, and the youngest  is  this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
1,42,33,"And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye  are  true  men ; leave one of your brethren  here  with me, and take  food for  the famine of your households, and be gone:"
1,42,34,"And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye  are  no spies, but  that  ye  are  true  men: so  will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land."
1,42,35,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money  was  in his sack: and when  both  they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid."
1,42,36,"And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved  of my children : Joseph  is  not, and Simeon  is  not, and ye will take Benjamin  away : all these things are against me."
1,42,37,"And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again."
1,42,38,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
1,43,1,"And the famine  was  sore in the land."
1,43,2,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food."
1,43,3,"And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother  be  with you."
1,43,4,"If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:"
1,43,5,"But if thou wilt not send  him , we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother  be  with you."
1,43,6,"And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye  so  ill with me,  as  to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?"
1,43,7,"And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying,  Is  your father yet alive? have ye  another  brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
1,43,8,"And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou,  and  also our little ones."
1,43,9,"I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:"
1,43,10,"For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time."
1,43,11,"And their father Israel said unto them, If  it must be  so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:"
1,43,12,"And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry  it  again in your hand; peradventure it  was  an oversight:"
1,43,13,"Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:"
1,43,14,"And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved  of my children , I am bereaved."
1,43,15,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."
1,43,16,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring  these  men home, and slay, and make ready; for  these  men shall dine with me at noon."
1,43,17,"And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house."
1,43,18,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses."
1,43,19,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,"
1,43,20,"And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:"
1,43,21,"And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,  every  man’s money  was  in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand."
1,43,22,"And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks."
1,43,23,"And he said, Peace  be  to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them."
1,43,24,"And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave  them  water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender."
1,43,25,"And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there."
1,43,26,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which  was  in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth."
1,43,27,"And he asked them of  their  welfare, and said,  Is  your father well, the old man of whom ye spake?  Is  he yet alive?"
1,43,28,"And they answered, Thy servant our father  is  in good health, he  is  yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance."
1,43,29,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said,  Is  this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son."
1,43,30,"And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought  where  to weep; and he entered into  his  chamber, and wept there."
1,43,31,"And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread."
1,43,32,"And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that  is  an abomination unto the Egyptians."
1,43,33,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another."
1,43,34,"And he took  and sent  messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him."
1,44,1,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks  with  food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth."
1,44,2,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
1,44,3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses."
1,44,4,"And  when they were gone out of the city,  and  not  yet  far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?"
1,44,5,"Is  not this  it  in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing."
1,44,6,"And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words."
1,44,7,"And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:"
1,44,8,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?"
1,44,9,"With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen."
1,44,10,"And he said, Now also  let  it  be  according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless."
1,44,11,"Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack."
1,44,12,"And he searched,  and  began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack."
1,44,13,"Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city."
1,44,14,"And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he  was  yet there: and they fell before him on the ground."
1,44,15,"And Joseph said unto them, What deed  is  this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?"
1,44,16,"And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we  are  my lord’s servants, both we, and  he  also with whom the cup is found."
1,44,17,"And he said, God forbid that I should do so:  but  the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father."
1,44,18,"Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou  art  even as Pharaoh."
1,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?"
1,44,20,"And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him."
1,44,21,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him."
1,44,22,"And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for  if  he should leave his father,  his father  would die."
1,44,23,"And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more."
1,44,24,"And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
1,44,25,"And our father said, Go again,  and  buy us a little food."
1,44,26,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother  be  with us."
1,44,27,"And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two  sons :"
1,44,28,"And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:"
1,44,29,"And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
1,44,30,"Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad  be  not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;"
1,44,31,"It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad  is  not  with us , that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave."
1,44,32,"For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever."
1,44,33,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren."
1,44,34,"For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad  be  not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father."
1,45,1,"Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren."
1,45,2,"And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard."
1,45,3,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I  am  Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence."
1,45,4,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I  am  Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt."
1,45,5,"Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life."
1,45,6,"For these two years  hath  the famine  been  in the land: and yet  there are  five years, in the which  there shall  neither  be  earing nor harvest."
1,45,7,"And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
1,45,8,"So now  it was  not you  that  sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt."
1,45,9,"Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:"
1,45,10,"And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:"
1,45,11,"And there will I nourish thee; for yet  there are  five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty."
1,45,12,"And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that  it is  my mouth that speaketh unto you."
1,45,13,"And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither."
1,45,14,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck."
1,45,15,"Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him."
1,45,16,"And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants."
1,45,17,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;"
1,45,18,"And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land."
1,45,19,"Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come."
1,45,20,"Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt  is  yours."
1,45,21,"And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way."
1,45,22,"To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred  pieces  of silver, and five changes of raiment."
1,45,23,"And to his father he sent after this  manner ; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way."
1,45,24,"So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way."
1,45,25,"And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,"
1,45,26,"And told him, saying, Joseph  is  yet alive, and he  is  governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob’s heart fainted, for he believed them not."
1,45,27,"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:"
1,45,28,"And Israel said,  It is  enough; Joseph my son  is  yet alive: I will go and see him before I die."
1,46,1,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac."
1,46,2,"And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here  am  I."
1,46,3,"And he said, I  am  God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:"
1,46,4,"I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up  again : and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes."
1,46,5,"And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
1,46,6,"And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:"
1,46,7,"His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt."
1,46,8,"And these  are  the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn."
1,46,9,"And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi."
1,46,10,"And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman."
1,46,11,"And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
1,46,12,"And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul."
1,46,13,"And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron."
1,46,14,"And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel."
1,46,15,"These  be  the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters  were  thirty and three."
1,46,16,"And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli."
1,46,17,"And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel."
1,46,18,"These  are  the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob,  even  sixteen souls."
1,46,19,"The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin."
1,46,20,"And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him."
1,46,21,"And the sons of Benjamin  were  Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard."
1,46,22,"These  are  the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls  were  fourteen."
1,46,23,"And the sons of Dan; Hushim."
1,46,24,"And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem."
1,46,25,"These  are  the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls  were  seven."
1,46,26,"All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls  were  threescore and six;"
1,46,27,"And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt,  were  two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt,  were  threescore and ten."
1,46,28,"And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen."
1,46,29,"And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while."
1,46,30,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou  art  yet alive."
1,46,31,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, which  were  in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;"
1,46,32,"And the men  are  shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have."
1,46,33,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What  is  your occupation?"
1,46,34,"That ye shall say, Thy servants’ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we,  and  also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd  is  an abomination unto the Egyptians."
1,47,1,"Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they  are  in the land of Goshen."
1,47,2,"And he took some of his brethren,  even  five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh."
1,47,3,"And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What  is  your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants  are  shepherds, both we,  and  also our fathers."
1,47,4,"They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine  is  sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
1,47,5,"And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:"
1,47,6,"The land of Egypt  is  before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest  any  men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle."
1,47,7,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
1,47,8,"And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old  art  thou?"
1,47,9,"And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage  are  an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage."
1,47,10,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh."
1,47,11,"And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
1,47,12,"And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to  their  families."
1,47,13,"And  there was  no bread in all the land; for the famine  was  very sore, so that the land of Egypt and  all  the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine."
1,47,14,"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house."
1,47,15,"And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth."
1,47,16,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail."
1,47,17,"And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread  in exchange  for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year."
1,47,18,"When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide  it  from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:"
1,47,19,"Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give  us  seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate."
1,47,20,"And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh’s."
1,47,21,"And as for the people, he removed them to cities from  one  end of the borders of Egypt even to the  other  end thereof."
1,47,22,"Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion  assigned them  of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands."
1,47,23,"Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo,  here is  seed for you, and ye shall sow the land."
1,47,24,"And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth  part  unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
1,47,25,"And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants."
1,47,26,"And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,  that  Pharaoh should have the fifth  part ; except the land of the priests only,  which  became not Pharaoh’s."
1,47,27,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly."
1,47,28,"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years."
1,47,29,"And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:"
1,47,30,"But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said."
1,47,31,"And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head."
1,48,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that  one  told Joseph, Behold, thy father  is  sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
1,48,2,"And  one  told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed."
1,48,3,"And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,"
1,48,4,"And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee  for  an everlasting possession."
1,48,5,"And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt,  are  mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine."
1,48,6,"And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,  and  shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance."
1,48,7,"And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet  there was  but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same  is  Bethlehem."
1,48,8,"And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who  are  these?"
1,48,9,"And Joseph said unto his father, They  are  my sons, whom God hath given me in this  place . And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them."
1,48,10,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age,  so that  he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them."
1,48,11,"And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed."
1,48,12,"And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth."
1,48,13,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought  them  near unto him."
1,48,14,"And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid  it  upon Ephraim’s head, who  was  the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh  was  the firstborn."
1,48,15,"And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,"
1,48,16,"The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
1,48,17,"And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head."
1,48,18,"And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this  is  the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head."
1,48,19,"And his father refused, and said, I know  it , my son, I know  it : he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations."
1,48,20,"And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh."
1,48,21,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers."
1,48,22,"Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."
1,49,1,"And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you  that  which shall befall you in the last days."
1,49,2,"Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father."
1,49,3,"Reuben, thou  art  my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:"
1,49,4,"Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou  it : he went up to my couch."
1,49,5,"Simeon and Levi  are  brethren; instruments of cruelty  are in  their habitations."
1,49,6,"O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall."
1,49,7,"Cursed  be  their anger, for  it was  fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel."
1,49,8,"Judah, thou  art he  whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand  shall be  in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee."
1,49,9,"Judah  is  a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?"
1,49,10,"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him  shall  the gathering of the people  be ."
1,49,11,"Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:"
1,49,12,"His eyes  shall be  red with wine, and his teeth white with milk."
1,49,13,"Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he  shall be  for an haven of ships; and his border  shall be  unto Zidon."
1,49,14,"Issachar  is  a strong ass couching down between two burdens:"
1,49,15,"And he saw that rest  was  good, and the land that  it was  pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute."
1,49,16,"Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel."
1,49,17,"Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward."
1,49,18,"I have waited for thy salvation, O"
1,49,19,"Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last."
1,49,20,"Out of Asher his bread  shall be  fat, and he shall yield royal dainties."
1,49,21,"Naphtali  is  a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words."
1,49,22,"Joseph  is  a fruitful bough,  even  a fruitful bough by a well;  whose  branches run over the wall:"
1,49,23,"The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot  at him , and hated him:"
1,49,24,"But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty  God  of Jacob; (from thence  is  the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)"
1,49,25,"Even  by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:"
1,49,26,"The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren."
1,49,27,"Benjamin shall ravin  as  a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil."
1,49,28,"All these  are  the twelve tribes of Israel: and this  is it  that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them."
1,49,29,"And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that  is  in the field of Ephron the Hittite,"
1,49,30,"In the cave that  is  in the field of Machpelah, which  is  before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace."
1,49,31,"There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah."
1,49,32,"The purchase of the field and of the cave that  is  therein  was  from the children of Heth."
1,49,33,"And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people."
1,50,1,"And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him."
1,50,2,"And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel."
1,50,3,"And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days."
1,50,4,"And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,"
1,50,5,"My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again."
1,50,6,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear."
1,50,7,"And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"
1,50,8,"And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen."
1,50,9,"And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company."
1,50,10,"And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which  is  beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days."
1,50,11,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This  is  a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which  is  beyond Jordan."
1,50,12,"And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:"
1,50,13,"For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre."
1,50,14,"And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father."
1,50,15,"And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him."
1,50,16,"And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,"
1,50,17,"So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him."
1,50,18,"And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we  be  thy servants."
1,50,19,"And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for  am  I in the place of God?"
1,50,20,"But as for you, ye thought evil against me;  but  God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as  it is  this day, to save much people alive."
1,50,21,"Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them."
1,50,22,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years."
1,50,23,"And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third  generation : the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph’s knees."
1,50,24,"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
1,50,25,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence."
1,50,26,"So Joseph died,  being  an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
2,1,1,"Now these  are  the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob."
2,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,"
2,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,"
2,1,4,"Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher."
2,1,5,"And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt  already ."
2,1,6,"And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation."
2,1,7,"And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them."
2,1,8,"Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph."
2,1,9,"And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel  are  more and mightier than we:"
2,1,10,"Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and  so  get them up out of the land."
2,1,11,"Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses."
2,1,12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel."
2,1,13,"And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:"
2,1,14,"And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve,  was  with rigour."
2,1,15,"And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one  was  Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:"
2,1,16,"And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see  them  upon the stools; if it  be  a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it  be  a daughter, then she shall live."
2,1,17,"But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive."
2,1,18,"And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?"
2,1,19,"And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women  are  not as the Egyptian women; for they  are  lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them."
2,1,20,"Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty."
2,1,21,"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses."
2,1,22,"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive."
2,2,1,"And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took  to wife  a daughter of Levi."
2,2,2,"And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he  was a  goodly  child , she hid him three months."
2,2,3,"And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid  it  in the flags by the river’s brink."
2,2,4,"And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him."
2,2,5,"And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash  herself  at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it."
2,2,6,"And when she had opened  it , she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This  is one  of the Hebrews’ children."
2,2,7,"Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?"
2,2,8,"And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother."
2,2,9,"And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give  thee  thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it."
2,2,10,"And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water."
2,2,11,"And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren."
2,2,12,"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that  there was  no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand."
2,2,13,"And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?"
2,2,14,"And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known."
2,2,15,"Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well."
2,2,16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew  water , and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock."
2,2,17,"And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock."
2,2,18,"And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How  is it that  ye are come so soon to day?"
2,2,19,"And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew  water  enough for us, and watered the flock."
2,2,20,"And he said unto his daughters, And where  is  he? why  is  it  that  ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread."
2,2,21,"And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter."
2,2,22,"And she bare  him  a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land."
2,2,23,"And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage."
2,2,24,"And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob."
2,2,25,"And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto  them ."
2,3,1,"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God,  even  to Horeb."
2,3,2,"And the angel of the"
2,3,3,"And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
2,3,4,"And when the"
2,3,5,"And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest  is  holy ground."
2,3,6,"Moreover he said, I  am  the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God."
2,3,7,"And the"
2,3,8,"And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites."
2,3,9,"Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them."
2,3,10,"Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt."
2,3,11,"And Moses said unto God, Who  am  I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?"
2,3,12,"And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this  shall be  a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain."
2,3,13,"And Moses said unto God, Behold,  when  I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What  is  his name? what shall I say unto them?"
2,3,14,"And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you."
2,3,15,"And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The"
2,3,16,"Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The"
2,3,17,"And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey."
2,3,18,"And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The"
2,3,19,"And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand."
2,3,20,"And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go."
2,3,21,"And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:"
2,3,22,"But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put  them  upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians."
2,4,1,"And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The"
2,4,2,"And the"
2,4,3,"And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it."
2,4,4,"And the"
2,4,5,"That they may believe that the"
2,4,6,"And the"
2,4,7,"And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his  other  flesh."
2,4,8,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign."
2,4,9,"And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour  it  upon the dry  land : and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry  land ."
2,4,10,"And Moses said unto the"
2,4,11,"And the"
2,4,12,"Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say."
2,4,13,"And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand  of him whom  thou wilt send."
2,4,14,"And the anger of the"
2,4,15,"And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do."
2,4,16,"And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,  even  he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God."
2,4,17,"And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs."
2,4,18,"And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which  are  in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace."
2,4,19,"And the"
2,4,20,"And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand."
2,4,21,"And the"
2,4,22,"And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the"
2,4,23,"And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,  even  thy firstborn."
2,4,24,"And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the"
2,4,25,"Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast  it  at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband  art  thou to me."
2,4,26,"So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband  thou art , because of the circumcision."
2,4,27,"And the"
2,4,28,"And Moses told Aaron all the words of the"
2,4,29,"And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:"
2,4,30,"And Aaron spake all the words which the"
2,4,31,"And the people believed: and when they heard that the"
2,5,1,"And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the"
2,5,2,"And Pharaoh said, Who  is  the"
2,5,3,"And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the"
2,5,4,"And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens."
2,5,5,"And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now  are  many, and ye make them rest from their burdens."
2,5,6,"And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,"
2,5,7,"Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves."
2,5,8,"And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish  ought  thereof: for they  be  idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go  and  sacrifice to our God."
2,5,9,"Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words."
2,5,10,"And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw."
2,5,11,"Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished."
2,5,12,"So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw."
2,5,13,"And the taskmasters hasted  them , saying, Fulfil your works,  your  daily tasks, as when there was straw."
2,5,14,"And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten,  and  demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?"
2,5,15,"Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?"
2,5,16,"There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants  are  beaten; but the fault  is  in thine own people."
2,5,17,"But he said, Ye  are  idle,  ye are  idle: therefore ye say, Let us go  and  do sacrifice to the"
2,5,18,"Go therefore now,  and  work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks."
2,5,19,"And the officers of the children of Israel did see  that  they  were  in evil  case , after it was said, Ye shall not minish  ought  from your bricks of your daily task."
2,5,20,"And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:"
2,5,21,"And they said unto them, The"
2,5,22,"And Moses returned unto the"
2,5,23,"For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all."
2,6,1,"Then the"
2,6,2,"And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I  am  the"
2,6,3,"And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by  the name of  God Almighty, but by my name"
2,6,4,"And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers."
2,6,5,"And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant."
2,6,6,"Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I  am  the"
2,6,7,"And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I  am  the"
2,6,8,"And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I  am  the"
2,6,9,"And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage."
2,6,10,"And the"
2,6,11,"Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land."
2,6,12,"And Moses spake before the"
2,6,13,"And the"
2,6,14,"These  be  the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these  be  the families of Reuben."
2,6,15,"And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these  are  the families of Simeon."
2,6,16,"And these  are  the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi  were  an hundred thirty and seven years."
2,6,17,"The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families."
2,6,18,"And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath  were  an hundred thirty and three years."
2,6,19,"And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these  are  the families of Levi according to their generations."
2,6,20,"And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram  were  an hundred and thirty and seven years."
2,6,21,"And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri."
2,6,22,"And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri."
2,6,23,"And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
2,6,24,"And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these  are  the families of the Korhites."
2,6,25,"And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him  one  of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these  are  the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families."
2,6,26,"These  are  that Aaron and Moses, to whom the"
2,6,27,"These  are  they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these  are  that Moses and Aaron."
2,6,28,"And it came to pass on the day  when  the"
2,6,29,"That the"
2,6,30,"And Moses said before the"
2,7,1,"And the"
2,7,2,"Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land."
2,7,3,"And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt."
2,7,4,"But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies,  and  my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments."
2,7,5,"And the Egyptians shall know that I  am  the"
2,7,6,"And Moses and Aaron did as the"
2,7,7,"And Moses  was  fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh."
2,7,8,"And the"
2,7,9,"When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast  it  before Pharaoh,  and  it shall become a serpent."
2,7,10,"And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the"
2,7,11,"Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments."
2,7,12,"For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods."
2,7,13,"And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the"
2,7,14,"And the"
2,7,15,"Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand."
2,7,16,"And thou shalt say unto him, The"
2,7,17,"Thus saith the"
2,7,18,"And the fish that  is  in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river."
2,7,19,"And the"
2,7,20,"And Moses and Aaron did so, as the"
2,7,21,"And the fish that  was  in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt."
2,7,22,"And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the"
2,7,23,"And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also."
2,7,24,"And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river."
2,7,25,"And seven days were fulfilled, after that the"
2,8,1,"And the"
2,8,2,"And if thou refuse to let  them  go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:"
2,8,3,"And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:"
2,8,4,"And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants."
2,8,5,"And the"
2,8,6,"And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt."
2,8,7,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt."
2,8,8,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the"
2,8,9,"And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses,  that  they may remain in the river only?"
2,8,10,"And he said, To morrow. And he said,  Be it  according to thy word: that thou mayest know that  there is  none like unto the"
2,8,11,"And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only."
2,8,12,"And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the"
2,8,13,"And the"
2,8,14,"And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank."
2,8,15,"But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the"
2,8,16,"And the"
2,8,17,"And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt."
2,8,18,"And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast."
2,8,19,"Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This  is  the finger of God: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the"
2,8,20,"And the"
2,8,21,"Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms  of flies  upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms  of flies , and also the ground whereon they  are ."
2,8,22,"And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms  of flies  shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I  am  the"
2,8,23,"And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be."
2,8,24,"And the"
2,8,25,"And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land."
2,8,26,"And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the"
2,8,27,"We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the"
2,8,28,"And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the"
2,8,29,"And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the"
2,8,30,"And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the"
2,8,31,"And the"
2,8,32,"And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go."
2,9,1,"Then the"
2,9,2,"For if thou refuse to let  them  go, and wilt hold them still,"
2,9,3,"Behold, the hand of the"
2,9,4,"And the"
2,9,5,"And the"
2,9,6,"And the"
2,9,7,"And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go."
2,9,8,"And the"
2,9,9,"And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth  with  blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt."
2,9,10,"And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth  with  blains upon man, and upon beast."
2,9,11,"And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians."
2,9,12,"And the"
2,9,13,"And the"
2,9,14,"For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that  there is  none like me in all the earth."
2,9,15,"For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth."
2,9,16,"And in very deed for this  cause  have I raised thee up, for to shew  in  thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth."
2,9,17,"As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?"
2,9,18,"Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now."
2,9,19,"Send therefore now,  and  gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field;  for upon  every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die."
2,9,20,"He that feared the word of the"
2,9,21,"And he that regarded not the word of the"
2,9,22,"And the"
2,9,23,"And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the"
2,9,24,"So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation."
2,9,25,"And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that  was  in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field."
2,9,26,"Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel  were , was there no hail."
2,9,27,"And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the"
2,9,28,"Intreat the"
2,9,29,"And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the"
2,9,30,"But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the"
2,9,31,"And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley  was  in the ear, and the flax  was  bolled."
2,9,32,"But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they  were  not grown up."
2,9,33,"And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the"
2,9,34,"And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants."
2,9,35,"And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the"
2,10,1,"And the"
2,10,2,"And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I  am  the"
2,10,3,"And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the"
2,10,4,"Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:"
2,10,5,"And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:"
2,10,6,"And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh."
2,10,7,"And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the"
2,10,8,"And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the"
2,10,9,"And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we  must hold  a feast unto the"
2,10,10,"And he said unto them, Let the"
2,10,11,"Not so: go now ye  that are  men, and serve the"
2,10,12,"And the"
2,10,13,"And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the"
2,10,14,"And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous  were they ; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such."
2,10,15,"For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt."
2,10,16,"Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the"
2,10,17,"Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the"
2,10,18,"And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the"
2,10,19,"And the"
2,10,20,"But the"
2,10,21,"And the"
2,10,22,"And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:"
2,10,23,"They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings."
2,10,24,"And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the"
2,10,25,"And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the"
2,10,26,"Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the"
2,10,27,"But the"
2,10,28,"And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in  that  day thou seest my face thou shalt die."
2,10,29,"And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more."
2,11,1,"And the"
2,11,2,"Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold."
2,11,3,"And the"
2,11,4,"And Moses said, Thus saith the"
2,11,5,"And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that  is  behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts."
2,11,6,"And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more."
2,11,7,"But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the"
2,11,8,"And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger."
2,11,9,"And the"
2,11,10,"And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the"
2,12,1,"And the"
2,12,2,"This month  shall be  unto you the beginning of months: it  shall be  the first month of the year to you."
2,12,3,"Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth  day  of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of  their  fathers, a lamb for an house:"
2,12,4,"And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take  it  according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb."
2,12,5,"Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take  it  out from the sheep, or from the goats:"
2,12,6,"And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening."
2,12,7,"And they shall take of the blood, and strike  it  on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it."
2,12,8,"And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread;  and  with bitter  herbs  they shall eat it."
2,12,9,"Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast  with  fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof."
2,12,10,"And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire."
2,12,11,"And thus shall ye eat it;  with  your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it  is  the"

2,12,14,"And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the"
2,12,15,"Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel."
2,12,16,"And in the first day  there shall be  an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save  that  which every man must eat, that only may be done of you."
2,12,17,"And ye shall observe  the feast of  unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever."
2,12,18,"In the first  month , on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even."
2,12,19,"Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land."
2,12,20,"Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread."
2,12,21,"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover."
2,12,22,"And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip  it  in the blood that  is  in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that  is  in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning."
2,12,23,"For the"

2,12,29,"And it came to pass, that at midnight the"
2,12,30,"And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for  there was  not a house where  there was  not one dead."
2,12,31,"And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,  and  get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the"
2,12,32,"Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also."
2,12,33,"And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We  be  all dead  men ."
2,12,34,"And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders."
2,12,35,"And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:"
2,12,36,"And the"
2,12,37,"And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot  that were  men, beside children."
2,12,38,"And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds,  even  very much cattle."
2,12,39,"And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual."
2,12,40,"Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,  was  four hundred and thirty years."
2,12,41,"And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the"

2,12,45,"A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof."
2,12,46,"In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof."
2,12,47,"All the congregation of Israel shall keep it."
2,12,48,"And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the"

2,13,5,"And it shall be when the"

2,13,8,"And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying,  This is done  because of that  which  the"

2,13,18,"But God led the people about,  through  the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt."
2,13,19,"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you."
2,13,20,"And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness."
2,13,21,"And the"

2,14,1,"And the"
2,14,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea."
2,14,3,"For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They  are  entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in."
2,14,4,"And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I  am  the"
2,14,5,"And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"
2,14,6,"And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:"
2,14,7,"And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them."
2,14,8,"And the"
2,14,9,"But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses  and  chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon."
2,14,10,"And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the"
2,14,11,"And they said unto Moses, Because  there were  no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?"
2,14,12,"Is  not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For  it had been  better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness."

2,14,21,"And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the"
2,14,22,"And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry  ground : and the waters  were  a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left."

2,16,14,"And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness  there lay  a small round thing,  as  small as the hoar frost on the ground."
2,16,15,"And when the children of Israel saw  it , they said one to another, It  is  manna: for they wist not what it  was . And Moses said unto them, This  is  the bread which the"

2,16,19,"And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning."
2,16,20,"Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them."
2,16,21,"And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted."
2,16,22,"And it came to pass,  that  on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one  man : and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses."
2,16,23,"And he said unto them, This  is that  which the"

2,16,25,"And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day  is  a sabbath unto the"
2,16,26,"Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day,  which is  the sabbath, in it there shall be none."
2,16,27,"And it came to pass,  that  there went out  some  of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none."
2,16,28,"And the"
2,16,29,"See, for that the"
2,16,30,"So the people rested on the seventh day."
2,16,31,"And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it  was  like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it  was  like wafers  made  with honey."
2,16,32,"And Moses said, This  is  the thing which the"

2,17,5,"And the"
2,17,6,"Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel."
2,17,7,"And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the"

2,18,3,"And her two sons; of which the name of the one  was  Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:"
2,18,4,"And the name of the other  was  Eliezer; for the God of my father,  said he, was  mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:"
2,18,5,"And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:"
2,18,6,"And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her."
2,18,7,"And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of  their  welfare; and they came into the tent."
2,18,8,"And Moses told his father in law all that the"

2,18,13,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening."
2,18,14,"And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What  is  this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?"
2,18,15,"And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:"
2,18,16,"When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make  them  know the statutes of God, and his laws."
2,18,17,"And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest  is  not good."
2,18,18,"Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that  is  with thee: for this thing  is  too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone."
2,18,19,"Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:"
2,18,20,"And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do."
2,18,21,"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place  such  over them,  to be  rulers of thousands,  and  rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:"
2,18,22,"And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be,  that  every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear  the burden  with thee."
2,18,23,"If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee  so , then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace."
2,18,24,"So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said."
2,18,25,"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
2,18,26,"And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves."
2,18,27,"And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land."
2,19,1,"In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they  into  the wilderness of Sinai."
2,19,2,"For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come  to  the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount."
2,19,3,"And Moses went up unto God, and the"
2,19,4,"Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and  how  I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself."
2,19,5,"Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth  is  mine:"
2,19,6,"And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These  are  the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel."
2,19,7,"And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the"
2,19,8,"And all the people answered together, and said, All that the"

2,19,13,"There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether  it be  beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount."
2,19,14,"And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes."
2,19,15,"And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at  your  wives."
2,19,16,"And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that  was  in the camp trembled."
2,19,17,"And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount."
2,19,18,"And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the"
2,19,19,"And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice."

2,20,15,"Thou shalt not steal."
2,20,16,"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour."
2,20,17,"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that  is  thy neighbour’s."
2,20,18,"And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw  it , they removed, and stood afar off."
2,20,19,"And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die."
2,20,20,"And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not."
2,20,21,"And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God  was ."
2,20,22,"And the"

2,20,25,"And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it."
2,20,26,"Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon."
2,21,1,"Now these  are  the judgments which thou shalt set before them."
2,21,2,"If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing."
2,21,3,"If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him."
2,21,4,"If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself."
2,21,5,"And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:"
2,21,6,"Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever."
2,21,7,"And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do."
2,21,8,"If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her."
2,21,9,"And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters."
2,21,10,"If he take him another  wife ; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish."
2,21,11,"And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money."
2,21,12,"He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death."
2,21,13,"And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver  him  into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee."
2,21,14,"But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die."
2,21,15,"And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death."
2,21,16,"And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death."
2,21,17,"And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death."
2,21,18,"And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with  his  fist, and he die not, but keepeth  his  bed:"
2,21,19,"If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote  him  be quit: only he shall pay  for  the loss of his time, and shall cause  him  to be thoroughly healed."
2,21,20,"And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished."
2,21,21,"Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he  is  his money."
2,21,22,"If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart  from her , and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman’s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges  determine ."
2,21,23,"And if  any  mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,"
2,21,24,"Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,"
2,21,25,"Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe."
2,21,26,"And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake."
2,21,27,"And if he smite out his manservant’s tooth, or his maidservant’s tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake."
2,21,28,"If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox  shall be  quit."
2,21,29,"But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death."
2,21,30,"If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him."
2,21,31,"Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him."
2,21,32,"If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned."
2,21,33,"And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;"
2,21,34,"The owner of the pit shall make  it  good,  and  give money unto the owner of them; and the dead  beast  shall be his."
2,21,35,"And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead  ox  also they shall divide."
2,21,36,"Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own."
2,22,1,"If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep."
2,22,2,"If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,  there shall  no blood  be shed  for him."
2,22,3,"If the sun be risen upon him,  there shall be  blood  shed  for him;  for  he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft."
2,22,4,"If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double."
2,22,5,"If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man’s field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution."
2,22,6,"If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed  therewith ; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution."
2,22,7,"If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief be found, let him pay double."
2,22,8,"If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges,  to see  whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods."
2,22,9,"For all manner of trespass,  whether it be  for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment,  or  for any manner of lost thing, which  another  challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges;  and  whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour."
2,22,10,"If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing  it :"
2,22,11,"Then  shall an oath of the"

2,22,13,"If it be torn in pieces,  then  let him bring it  for  witness,  and  he shall not make good that which was torn."
2,22,14,"And if a man borrow  ought  of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof  being  not with it, he shall surely make  it  good."
2,22,15,"But  if the owner thereof  be  with it, he shall not make  it  good: if it  be  an hired  thing , it came for his hire."
2,22,16,"And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife."
2,22,17,"If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins."
2,22,18,"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
2,22,19,"Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death."
2,22,20,"He that sacrificeth unto  any  god, save unto the"
2,22,21,"Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt."
2,22,22,"Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child."
2,22,23,"If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;"
2,22,24,"And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless."
2,22,25,"If thou lend money to  any of  my people  that is  poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury."
2,22,26,"If thou at all take thy neighbour’s raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:"
2,22,27,"For that  is  his covering only, it  is  his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I  am  gracious."
2,22,28,"Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people."
2,22,29,"Thou shalt not delay  to offer  the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me."
2,22,30,"Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen,  and  with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me."
2,22,31,"And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat  any  flesh  that is  torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs."
2,23,1,"Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness."
2,23,2,"Thou shalt not follow a multitude to  do  evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest  judgment :"
2,23,3,"Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause."
2,23,4,"If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again."
2,23,5,"If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him."
2,23,6,"Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause."
2,23,7,"Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked."
2,23,8,"And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous."
2,23,9,"Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt."
2,23,10,"And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:"
2,23,11,"But the seventh  year  thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard,  and  with thy oliveyard."
2,23,12,"Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed."
2,23,13,"And in all  things  that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth."
2,23,14,"Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year."
2,23,15,"Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)"
2,23,16,"And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering,  which is  in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field."
2,23,17,"Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord"
2,23,18,"Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning."
2,23,19,"The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the"
2,23,20,"Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared."
2,23,21,"Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name  is  in him."
2,23,22,"But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries."
2,23,23,"For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites,  and  the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off."
2,23,24,"Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images."
2,23,25,"And ye shall serve the"

2,23,27,"I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee."
2,23,28,"And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee."
2,23,29,"I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee."
2,23,30,"By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land."
2,23,31,"And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee."
2,23,32,"Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods."
2,23,33,"They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee."
2,24,1,"And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the"

2,24,9,"Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:"
2,24,10,"And they saw the God of Israel: and  there was  under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in  his  clearness."
2,24,11,"And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink."
2,24,12,"And the"
2,24,13,"And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God."
2,24,14,"And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur  are  with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them."
2,24,15,"And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount."
2,24,16,"And the glory of the"

2,25,3,"And this  is  the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,"
2,25,4,"And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’  hair ,"
2,25,5,"And rams’ skins dyed red, and badgers’ skins, and shittim wood,"

2,25,9,"According to all that I shew thee,  after  the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make  it ."
2,25,10,"And they shall make an ark  of  shittim wood: two cubits and a half  shall be  the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof."
2,25,11,"And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about."
2,25,12,"And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put  them  in the four corners thereof; and two rings  shall be  in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it."
2,25,13,"And thou shalt make staves  of  shittim wood, and overlay them with gold."
2,25,14,"And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them."
2,25,15,"The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it."
2,25,16,"And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee."
2,25,17,"And thou shalt make a mercy seat  of  pure gold: two cubits and a half  shall be  the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof."
2,25,18,"And thou shalt make two cherubims  of  gold,  of  beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat."
2,25,19,"And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end:  even  of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof."
2,25,20,"And the cherubims shall stretch forth  their  wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces  shall look  one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be."
2,25,21,"And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee."
2,25,22,"And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which  are  upon the ark of the testimony, of all  things  which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel."
2,25,23,"Thou shalt also make a table  of  shittim wood: two cubits  shall be  the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof."
2,25,24,"And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about."

2,25,31,"And thou shalt make a candlestick  of  pure gold:  of  beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same."
2,25,32,"And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:"
2,25,33,"Three bowls made like unto almonds,  with  a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch,  with  a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick."
2,25,34,"And in the candlestick  shall be  four bowls made like unto almonds,  with  their knops and their flowers."
2,25,35,"And  there shall be  a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick."
2,25,36,"Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it  shall be  one beaten work  of  pure gold."

2,32,12,"Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people."
2,32,13,"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit  it  for ever."
2,32,14,"And the"
2,32,15,"And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony  were  in his hand: the tables  were  written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other  were  they written."
2,32,16,"And the tables  were  the work of God, and the writing  was  the writing of God, graven upon the tables."
2,32,17,"And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses,  There is  a noise of war in the camp."
2,32,18,"And he said,  It is  not the voice of  them that  shout for mastery, neither  is it  the voice of  them that  cry for being overcome:  but  the noise of  them that  sing do I hear."
2,32,19,"And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount."
2,32,20,"And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt  it  in the fire, and ground  it  to powder, and strawed  it  upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink  of it ."
2,32,21,"And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?"
2,32,22,"And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they  are set  on mischief."
2,32,23,"For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for  as for  this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him."
2,32,24,"And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break  it  off. So they gave  it  me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf."
2,32,25,"And when Moses saw that the people  were  naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto  their  shame among their enemies:)"
2,32,26,"Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who  is  on the"
2,32,27,"And he said unto them, Thus saith the"
2,32,28,"And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men."
2,32,29,"For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the"
2,32,30,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the"
2,32,31,"And Moses returned unto the"
2,32,32,"Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written."
2,32,33,"And the"
2,32,34,"Therefore now go, lead the people unto  the place  of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them."
2,32,35,"And the"
2,33,1,"And the"
2,33,2,"And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:"
2,33,3,"Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou  art  a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way."
2,33,4,"And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments."
2,33,5,"For the"
2,33,6,"And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb."
2,33,7,"And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass,  that  every one which sought the"
2,33,8,"And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,  that  all the people rose up, and stood every man  at  his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle."
2,33,9,"And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood  at  the door of the tabernacle, and  the"
2,33,10,"And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand  at  the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man  in  his tent door."
2,33,11,"And the"
2,33,12,"And Moses said unto the"
2,33,13,"Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation  is  thy people."
2,33,14,"And he said, My presence shall go  with thee , and I will give thee rest."
2,33,15,"And he said unto him, If thy presence go not  with me , carry us not up hence."
2,33,16,"For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight?  is it  not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that  are  upon the face of the earth."
2,33,17,"And the"
2,33,18,"And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory."
2,33,19,"And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the"
2,33,20,"And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live."
2,33,21,"And the"
2,33,22,"And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:"
2,33,23,"And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen."
2,34,1,"And the"
2,34,2,"And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount."
2,34,3,"And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount."
2,34,4,"And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the"

2,34,8,"And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped."
2,34,9,"And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it  is  a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance."
2,34,10,"And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou  art  shall see the work of the"

2,34,12,"Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:"
2,34,13,"But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:"
2,34,14,"For thou shalt worship no other god: for the"

2,36,7,"For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much."
2,36,8,"And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains  of  fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet:  with  cherubims of cunning work made he them."

2,36,10,"And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and  the other  five curtains he coupled one unto another."
2,36,11,"And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of  another  curtain, in the coupling of the second."
2,36,12,"Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which  was  in the coupling of the second: the loops held one  curtain  to another."
2,36,13,"And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle."

2,36,20,"And he made boards for the tabernacle  of  shittim wood, standing up."
2,36,21,"The length of a board  was  ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half."
2,36,22,"One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle."

2,37,3,"And he cast for it four rings of gold,  to be set  by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it."
2,37,4,"And he made staves  of  shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold."
2,37,5,"And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark."
2,37,6,"And he made the mercy seat  of  pure gold: two cubits and a half  was  the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof."
2,37,7,"And he made two cherubims  of  gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;"
2,37,8,"One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the  other  end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof."
2,37,9,"And the cherubims spread out  their  wings on high,  and  covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another;  even  to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims."
2,37,10,"And he made the table  of  shittim wood: two cubits  was  the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:"
2,37,11,"And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about."
2,37,12,"Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about."
2,37,13,"And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that  were  in the four feet thereof."
2,37,14,"Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table."
2,37,15,"And he made the staves  of  shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table."
2,37,16,"And he made the vessels which  were  upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal,  of  pure gold."
2,37,17,"And he made the candlestick  of  pure gold:  of  beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:"
2,37,18,"And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:"
2,37,19,"Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick."
2,37,20,"And in the candlestick  were  four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers:"

4,18,11,"And this  is  thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it."
4,18,12,"All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the"

4,18,19,"All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the"

4,18,22,"Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die."
4,18,23,"But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity:  it shall be  a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance."
4,18,24,"But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer  as  an heave offering unto the"
4,18,25,"And the"
4,18,26,"Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the"
4,18,27,"And  this  your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though  it were  the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress."
4,18,28,"Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the"
4,18,29,"Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the"
4,18,30,"Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress."
4,18,31,"And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it  is  your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation."
4,18,32,"And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die."
4,19,1,"And the"
4,19,2,"This  is  the ordinance of the law which the"

4,19,4,"And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:"
4,19,5,"And  one  shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:"
4,19,6,"And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast  it  into the midst of the burning of the heifer."
4,19,7,"Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even."
4,19,8,"And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even."
4,19,9,"And a man  that is  clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay  them  up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it  is  a purification for sin."
4,19,10,"And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever."
4,19,11,"He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days."
4,19,12,"He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean."
4,19,13,"Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the"
4,19,14,"This  is  the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that  is  in the tent, shall be unclean seven days."
4,19,15,"And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it,  is  unclean."
4,19,16,"And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days."
4,19,17,"And for an unclean  person  they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel:"
4,19,18,"And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip  it  in the water, and sprinkle  it  upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:"
4,19,19,"And the clean  person  shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even."
4,19,20,"But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the"

4,20,1,"Then came the children of Israel,  even  the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there."
4,20,2,"And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron."
4,20,3,"And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the"
4,20,4,"And why have ye brought up the congregation of the"
4,20,5,"And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it  is  no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither  is  there any water to drink."
4,20,6,"And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the"

4,20,8,"Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink."
4,20,9,"And Moses took the rod from before the"
4,20,10,"And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?"
4,20,11,"And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts  also ."
4,20,12,"And the"
4,20,13,"This  is  the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the"
4,20,14,"And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:"
4,20,15,"How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:"
4,20,16,"And when we cried unto the"
4,20,17,"Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink  of  the water of the wells: we will go by the king’s  high  way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders."
4,20,18,"And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword."
4,20,19,"And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without  doing  any thing  else , go through on my feet."
4,20,20,"And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand."
4,20,21,"Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him."
4,20,22,"And the children of Israel,  even  the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor."
4,20,23,"And the"
4,20,24,"Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah."
4,20,25,"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:"
4,20,26,"And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered  unto his people , and shall die there."
4,20,27,"And Moses did as the"
4,20,28,"And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount."
4,20,29,"And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days,  even  all the house of Israel."
4,21,1,"And  when  king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took  some  of them prisoners."
4,21,2,"And Israel vowed a vow unto the"
4,21,3,"And the"
4,21,4,"And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way."
4,21,5,"And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for  there is  no bread, neither  is there any  water; and our soul loatheth this light bread."
4,21,6,"And the"
4,21,7,"Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the"

4,21,9,"And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived."
4,21,10,"And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth."
4,21,11,"And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which  is  before Moab, toward the sunrising."
4,21,12,"From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared."
4,21,13,"From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which  is  in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon  is  the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites."
4,21,14,"Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the"
4,21,15,"And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab."
4,21,16,"And from thence  they went  to Beer: that  is  the well whereof the"
4,21,17,"Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:"
4,21,18,"The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by  the direction of  the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness  they went  to Mattanah:"
4,21,19,"And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:"
4,21,20,"And from Bamoth  in  the valley, that  is  in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon."
4,21,21,"And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,"
4,21,22,"Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink  of  the waters of the well:  but  we will go along by the king’s  high  way, until we be past thy borders."
4,21,23,"And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel."
4,21,24,"And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon  was  strong."
4,21,25,"And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof."
4,21,26,"For Heshbon  was  the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon."
4,21,27,"Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:"
4,21,28,"For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab,  and  the lords of the high places of Arnon."
4,21,29,"Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites."
4,21,30,"We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which  reacheth  unto Medeba."
4,21,31,"Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites."
4,21,32,"And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that  were  there."
4,21,33,"And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei."
4,21,34,"And the"
4,21,35,"So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land."
4,22,1,"And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan  by  Jericho."
4,22,2,"And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites."
4,22,3,"And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they  were  many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel."
4,22,4,"And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all  that are  round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor  was  king of the Moabites at that time."
4,22,5,"He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which  is  by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:"
4,22,6,"Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they  are  too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail,  that  we may smite them, and  that  I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest  is  blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed."
4,22,7,"And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak."
4,22,8,"And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the"
4,22,9,"And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men  are  these with thee?"
4,22,10,"And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me,  saying ,"
4,22,11,"Behold,  there is  a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out."
4,22,12,"And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they  are  blessed."
4,22,13,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the"
4,22,14,"And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us."
4,22,15,"And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they."
4,22,16,"And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:"
4,22,17,"For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people."
4,22,18,"And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the"
4,22,19,"Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the"
4,22,20,"And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up,  and  go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do."
4,22,21,"And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab."
4,22,22,"And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the"
4,22,23,"And the ass saw the angel of the"
4,22,24,"But the angel of the"
4,22,25,"And when the ass saw the angel of the"

4,22,27,"And when the ass saw the angel of the"
4,22,28,"And the"
4,22,29,"And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee."
4,22,30,"And the ass said unto Balaam,  Am  not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since  I was  thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay."
4,22,31,"Then the"
4,22,32,"And the angel of the"
4,22,33,"And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive."
4,22,34,"And Balaam said unto the angel of the"
4,22,35,"And the angel of the"
4,22,36,"And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which  is  in the border of Arnon, which  is  in the utmost coast."
4,22,37,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?"
4,22,38,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak."
4,22,39,"And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth."
4,22,40,"And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that  were  with him."
4,22,41,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost  part  of the people."
4,23,1,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams."
4,23,2,"And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on  every  altar a bullock and a ram."
4,23,3,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the"
4,23,4,"And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon  every  altar a bullock and a ram."
4,23,5,"And the"
4,23,6,"And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab."
4,23,7,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,  saying , Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel."
4,23,8,"How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,  whom  the"
4,23,9,"For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations."
4,23,10,"Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth  part  of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!"
4,23,11,"And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed  them  altogether."
4,23,12,"And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the"
4,23,13,"And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence."
4,23,14,"And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on  every  altar."
4,23,15,"And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet  the"
4,23,16,"And the"
4,23,17,"And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the"
4,23,18,"And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:"
4,23,19,"God  is  not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do  it ? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?"
4,23,20,"Behold, I have received  commandment  to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it."
4,23,21,"He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the"
4,23,22,"God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn."
4,23,23,"Surely  there is  no enchantment against Jacob, neither  is there  any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!"
4,23,24,"Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat  of  the prey, and drink the blood of the slain."
4,23,25,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all."
4,23,26,"But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the"
4,23,27,"And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence."
4,23,28,"And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon."
4,23,29,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams."
4,23,30,"And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on  every  altar."
4,24,1,"And when Balaam saw that it pleased the"
4,24,2,"And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding  in his tents  according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him."
4,24,3,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:"
4,24,4,"He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling  into a trance , but having his eyes open:"
4,24,5,"How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,  and  thy tabernacles, O Israel!"
4,24,6,"As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s side, as the trees of lign aloes which the"
4,24,7,"He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed  shall be  in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted."
4,24,8,"God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce  them  through with his arrows."
4,24,9,"He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed  is  he that blesseth thee, and cursed  is  he that curseth thee."
4,24,10,"And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed  them  these three times."
4,24,11,"Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the"
4,24,12,"And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,"
4,24,13,"If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the"
4,24,14,"And now, behold, I go unto my people: come  therefore, and  I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days."
4,24,15,"And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:"
4,24,16,"He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High,  which  saw the vision of the Almighty, falling  into a trance , but having his eyes open:"
4,24,17,"I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth."
4,24,18,"And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly."
4,24,19,"Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city."
4,24,20,"And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek  was  the first of the nations; but his latter end  shall be  that he perish for ever."
4,24,21,"And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock."
4,24,22,"Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive."

5,1,14,"And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken  is  good  for us  to do."
5,1,15,"So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes."
5,1,16,"And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear  the causes  between your brethren, and judge righteously between  every  man and his brother, and the stranger  that is  with him."
5,1,17,"Ye shall not respect persons in judgment;  but  ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment  is  God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring  it  unto me, and I will hear it."
5,1,18,"And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do."
5,1,19,"And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the"

5,1,23,"And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:"
5,1,24,"And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out."
5,1,25,"And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought  it  down unto us, and brought us word again, and said,  It is  a good land which the"

5,1,40,"But  as for  you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea."
5,1,41,"Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the"

5,1,45,"And ye returned and wept before the"

5,2,5,"Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau  for  a possession."

5,2,7,"For the"

5,2,14,"And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered,  was  thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the"

5,2,23,"And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim,  even  unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)"
5,2,24,"Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess  it , and contend with him in battle."
5,2,25,"This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations  that are  under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee."
5,2,26,"And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,"
5,2,27,"Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left."
5,2,28,"Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;"

5,2,36,"From Aroer, which  is  by the brink of the river of Arnon, and  from  the city that  is  by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the"

5,3,2,"And the"

5,3,4,"And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
5,3,5,"All these cities  were  fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many."
5,3,6,"And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city."
5,3,7,"But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves."
5,3,8,"And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that  was  on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;"
5,3,9,"( Which  Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)"
5,3,10,"All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
5,3,11,"For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead  was  a bedstead of iron;  is  it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits  was  the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man."
5,3,12,"And this land,  which  we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which  is  by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites."
5,3,13,"And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan,  being  the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants."
5,3,14,"Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day."
5,3,15,"And I gave Gilead unto Machir."
5,3,16,"And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok,  which is  the border of the children of Ammon;"
5,3,17,"The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast  thereof , from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain,  even  the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward."
5,3,18,"And I commanded you at that time, saying, The"
5,3,19,"But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, ( for  I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;"
5,3,20,"Until the"

5,32,50,"And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:"
5,32,51,"Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel."

6,2,5,"And it came to pass  about the time  of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them."
6,2,6,"But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof."
6,2,7,"And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate."

6,2,16,"And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way."
6,2,17,"And the men said unto her, We  will be  blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear."
6,2,18,"Behold,  when  we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household, home unto thee."
6,2,19,"And it shall be,  that  whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood  shall be  upon his head, and we  will be  guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood  shall be  on our head, if  any  hand be upon him."
6,2,20,"And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear."
6,2,21,"And she said, According unto your words, so  be  it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window."
6,2,22,"And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought  them  throughout all the way, but found  them  not."
6,2,23,"So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all  things  that befell them:"
6,2,24,"And they said unto Joshua, Truly the"
6,3,1,"And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over."
6,3,2,"And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;"
6,3,3,"And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the"
6,3,4,"Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed  this  way heretofore."
6,3,5,"And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the"
6,3,6,"And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people."
6,3,7,"And the"
6,3,8,"And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan."
6,3,9,"And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the"
6,3,10,"And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God  is  among you, and  that  he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites."
6,3,11,"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan."
6,3,12,"Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man."
6,3,13,"And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the"
6,3,14,"And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;"
6,3,15,"And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)"
6,3,16,"That the waters which came down from above stood  and  rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that  is  beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,  even  the salt sea, failed,  and  were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho."
6,3,17,"And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the"

6,4,2,"Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,"
6,4,3,"And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night."
6,4,4,"Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:"
6,4,5,"And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the"
6,4,6,"That this may be a sign among you,  that  when your children ask  their fathers  in time to come, saying, What  mean  ye by these stones?"
6,4,7,"Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the"

6,4,9,"And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day."
6,4,10,"For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the"
6,4,11,"And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the"
6,4,12,"And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:"
6,4,13,"About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the"

6,4,15,"And the"

6,4,18,"And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the"

6,4,20,"And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal."
6,4,21,"And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What  mean  these stones?"
6,4,22,"Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land."
6,4,23,"For the"
6,4,24,"That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the"

6,5,4,"And this  is  the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt,  that were  males,  even  all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt."
6,5,5,"Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people  that were  born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt,  them  they had not circumcised."
6,5,6,"For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people  that were  men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the"
6,5,7,"And their children,  whom  he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way."
6,5,8,"And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole."
6,5,9,"And the"
6,5,10,"And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho."
6,5,11,"And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched  corn  in the selfsame day."
6,5,12,"And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."
6,5,13,"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him,  Art  thou for us, or for our adversaries?"
6,5,14,"And he said, Nay; but  as  captain of the host of the"
6,5,15,"And the captain of the"

6,6,4,"And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams’ horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets."
6,6,5,"And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long  blast  with the ram’s horn,  and  when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him."
6,6,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the"
6,6,7,"And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the"
6,6,8,"And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before the"

6,6,10,"And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall  any  word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout."

6,6,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times."
6,6,16,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the"
6,6,17,"And the city shall be accursed,  even  it, and all that  are  therein, to the"
6,6,18,"And ye, in any wise keep  yourselves  from the accursed thing, lest ye make  yourselves  accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it."
6,6,19,"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,  are  consecrated unto the"
6,6,20,"So the people shouted when  the priests  blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city."
6,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed all that  was  in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword."
6,6,22,"But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her."
6,6,23,"And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel."
6,6,24,"And they burnt the city with fire, and all that  was  therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the"
6,6,25,"And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel  even  unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."
6,6,26,"And Joshua adjured  them  at that time, saying, Cursed  be  the man before the"
6,6,27,"So the"
6,7,1,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the"
6,7,2,"And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which  is  beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai."
6,7,3,"And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai;  and  make not all the people to labour thither; for they  are but  few."
6,7,4,"So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai."
6,7,5,"And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them  from  before the gate  even  unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water."
6,7,6,"And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the"
6,7,7,"And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord"
6,7,8,"O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!"
6,7,9,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear  of it , and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?"
6,7,10,"And the"
6,7,11,"Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put  it  even among their own stuff."
6,7,12,"Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies,  but  turned  their  backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you."
6,7,13,"Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the"
6,7,14,"In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be,  that  the tribe which the"

6,7,16,"So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:"
6,7,17,"And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:"
6,7,18,"And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken."
6,7,19,"And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the"
6,7,20,"And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the"
6,7,21,"When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they  are  hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it."
6,7,22,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold,  it was  hid in his tent, and the silver under it."
6,7,23,"And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the"
6,7,24,"And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor."
6,7,25,"And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the"
6,7,26,"And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the"
6,8,1,"And the"
6,8,2,"And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it."
6,8,3,"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night."
6,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city,  even  behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:"
6,8,5,"And I, and all the people that  are  with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,"
6,8,6,"(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them."
6,8,7,"Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the"
6,8,8,"And it shall be, when ye have taken the city,  that  ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the"
6,8,9,"Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people."
6,8,10,"And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai."
6,8,11,"And all the people,  even the people  of war that  were  with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now  there was  a valley between them and Ai."
6,8,12,"And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city."
6,8,13,"And when they had set the people,  even  all the host that  was  on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley."
6,8,14,"And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw  it , that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that  there were  liers in ambush against him behind the city."
6,8,15,"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness."
6,8,16,"And all the people that  were  in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city."
6,8,17,"And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel."
6,8,18,"And the"
6,8,19,"And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire."
6,8,20,"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers."
6,8,21,"And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai."
6,8,22,"And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape."
6,8,23,"And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua."
6,8,24,"And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword."
6,8,25,"And  so  it was,  that  all that fell that day, both of men and women,  were  twelve thousand,  even  all the men of Ai."
6,8,26,"For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai."
6,8,27,"Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the"
6,8,28,"And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever,  even  a desolation unto this day."
6,8,29,"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones,  that remaineth  unto this day."
6,8,30,"Then Joshua built an altar unto the"
6,8,31,"As Moses the servant of the"
6,8,32,"And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel."
6,8,33,"And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the"
6,8,34,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law."
6,8,35,"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them."
6,9,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings which  were  on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard  thereof ;"
6,9,2,"That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord."
6,9,3,"And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,"
6,9,4,"They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;"
6,9,5,"And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry  and  mouldy."
6,9,6,"And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us."
6,9,7,"And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?"
6,9,8,"And they said unto Joshua, We  are  thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who  are  ye? and from whence come ye?"
6,9,9,"And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the"
6,9,10,"And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that  were  beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which  was  at Ashtaroth."
6,9,11,"Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We  are  your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us."
6,9,12,"This our bread we took hot  for  our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:"
6,9,13,"And these bottles of wine, which we filled,  were  new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey."
6,9,14,"And the men took of their victuals, and asked not  counsel  at the mouth of the"
6,9,15,"And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them."
6,9,16,"And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they  were  their neighbours, and  that  they dwelt among them."
6,9,17,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities  were  Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim."
6,9,18,"And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the"
6,9,19,"But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the"
6,9,20,"This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them."
6,9,21,"And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them."
6,9,22,"And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We  are  very far from you; when ye dwell among us?"
6,9,23,"Now therefore ye  are  cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God."
6,9,24,"And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the"
6,9,25,"And now, behold, we  are  in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do."
6,9,26,"And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not."
6,9,27,"And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the"
6,10,1,"Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;"
6,10,2,"That they feared greatly, because Gibeon  was  a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it  was  greater than Ai, and all the men thereof  were  mighty."
6,10,3,"Wherefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,"
6,10,4,"Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel."
6,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it."
6,10,6,"And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us."
6,10,7,"So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour."
6,10,8,"And the"
6,10,9,"Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly,  and  went up from Gilgal all night."
6,10,10,"And the"
6,10,11,"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel,  and  were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the"
6,10,12,"Then spake Joshua to the"
6,10,13,"And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.  Is  not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day."
6,10,14,"And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the"
6,10,15,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal."
6,10,16,"But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah."
6,10,17,"And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah."
6,10,18,"And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:"
6,10,19,"And stay ye not,  but  pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the"
6,10,20,"And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest  which  remained of them entered into fenced cities."
6,10,21,"And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel."
6,10,22,"Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave."
6,10,23,"And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish,  and  the king of Eglon."
6,10,24,"And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them."
6,10,25,"And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the"
6,10,26,"And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening."
6,10,27,"And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,  that  Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave’s mouth,  which remain  until this very day."
6,10,28,"And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that  were  therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho."
6,10,29,"Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:"
6,10,30,"And the"
6,10,31,"And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:"
6,10,32,"And the"
6,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining."
6,10,34,"And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:"
6,10,35,"And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that  were  therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish."
6,10,36,"And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:"
6,10,37,"And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that  were  therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that  were  therein."
6,10,38,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:"
6,10,39,"And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that  were  therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king."
6,10,40,"So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the"
6,10,41,"And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon."
6,10,42,"And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the"

6,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard  those things , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,"
6,11,2,"And to the kings that  were  on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,"

6,11,4,"And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that  is  upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many."
6,11,5,"And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel."
6,11,6,"And the"
6,11,7,"So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them."
6,11,8,"And the"
6,11,9,"And Joshua did unto them as the"

6,11,11,"And they smote all the souls that  were  therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying  them : there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire."
6,11,12,"And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword,  and  he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the"
6,11,13,"But  as for  the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only;  that  did Joshua burn."
6,11,14,"And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe."
6,11,15,"As the"
6,11,16,"So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;"
6,11,17,"Even  from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them."
6,11,18,"Joshua made war a long time with all those kings."
6,11,19,"There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all  other  they took in battle."
6,11,20,"For it was of the"

6,17,12,"Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out  the inhabitants of  those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land."
6,17,13,"Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out."
6,17,14,"And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me  but  one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I  am  a great people, forasmuch as the"
6,17,15,"And Joshua answered them, If thou  be  a great people,  then  get thee up to the wood  country , and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee."
6,17,16,"And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron,  both they  who  are  of Bethshean and her towns, and  they  who  are  of the valley of Jezreel."
6,17,17,"And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph,  even  to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou  art  a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot  only :"
6,17,18,"But the mountain shall be thine; for it  is  a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots,  and  though they  be  strong."
6,18,1,"And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them."
6,18,2,"And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance."
6,18,3,"And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long  are  ye slack to go to possess the land, which the"

6,18,9,"And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came  again  to Joshua to the host at Shiloh."
6,18,10,"And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the"
6,18,11,"And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph."
6,18,12,"And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven."
6,18,13,"And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which  is  Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that  lieth  on the south side of the nether Bethhoron."
6,18,14,"And the border was drawn  thence , and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that  lieth  before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which  is  Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this  was  the west quarter."
6,18,15,"And the south quarter  was  from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:"
6,18,16,"And the border came down to the end of the mountain that  lieth  before the valley of the son of Hinnom,  and  which  is  in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,"
6,18,17,"And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which  is  over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,"
6,18,18,"And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:"
6,18,19,"And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this  was  the south coast."
6,18,20,"And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This  was  the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families."
6,18,21,"Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,"

6,19,9,"Out of the portion of the children of Judah  was  the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them."
6,19,10,"And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:"

6,21,11,"And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which  city is  Hebron, in the hill  country  of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it."
6,21,12,"But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession."
6,21,13,"Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs,  to be  a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,"
6,21,14,"And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,"
6,21,15,"And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,"

6,21,21,"For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim,  to be  a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs,"

6,21,39,"Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all."
6,21,40,"So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were  by  their lot twelve cities."
6,21,41,"All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel  were  forty and eight cities with their suburbs."
6,21,42,"These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus  were  all these cities."

6,22,8,"And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren."
6,22,9,"And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which  is  in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the"
6,22,10,"And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that  are  in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to."
6,22,11,"And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel."
6,22,12,"And when the children of Israel heard  of it , the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them."
6,22,13,"And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,"
6,22,14,"And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one  was  an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel."
6,22,15,"And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,"

6,24,9,"Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:"
6,24,10,"But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand."
6,24,11,"And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand."

6,24,33,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill  that pertained to  Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim."
7,1,1,"Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the"

7,1,3,"And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him."
7,1,4,"And Judah went up; and the"
7,1,5,"And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites."
7,1,6,"But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes."
7,1,7,"And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered  their meat  under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died."
7,1,8,"Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire."
7,1,9,"And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley."
7,1,10,"And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before  was  Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai."
7,1,11,"And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before  was  Kirjathsepher:"
7,1,12,"And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife."
7,1,13,"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife."
7,1,14,"And it came to pass, when she came  to him , that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off  her  ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?"
7,1,15,"And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs."
7,1,16,"And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which  lieth  in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people."
7,1,17,"And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah."
7,1,18,"Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof."
7,1,19,"And the"
7,1,20,"And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak."
7,1,21,"And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day."
7,1,22,"And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the"
7,1,23,"And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before  was  Luz.)"
7,1,24,"And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy."
7,1,25,"And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family."
7,1,26,"And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which  is  the name thereof unto this day."
7,1,27,"Neither did Manasseh drive out  the inhabitants of  Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land."
7,1,28,"And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out."
7,1,29,"Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them."
7,1,30,"Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries."
7,1,31,"Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:"
7,1,32,"But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out."
7,1,33,"Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them."
7,1,34,"And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:"
7,1,35,"But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries."
7,1,36,"And the coast of the Amorites  was  from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward."
7,2,1,"And an angel of the"

7,2,3,"Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be  as thorns  in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you."
7,2,4,"And it came to pass, when the angel of the"

7,2,10,"And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the"

7,2,20,"And the anger of the"

7,3,4,"And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the"
7,3,5,"And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:"
7,3,6,"And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods."

7,3,12,"And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the"
7,3,13,"And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees."
7,3,14,"So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years."
7,3,15,"But when the children of Israel cried unto the"
7,3,16,"But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh."
7,3,17,"And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon  was  a very fat man."
7,3,18,"And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present."
7,3,19,"But he himself turned again from the quarries that  were  by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him."
7,3,20,"And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of  his  seat."
7,3,21,"And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:"
7,3,22,"And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out."
7,3,23,"Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them."
7,3,24,"When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour  were  locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber."
7,3,25,"And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened  them : and, behold, their lord  was  fallen down dead on the earth."
7,3,26,"And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath."
7,3,27,"And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them."
7,3,28,"And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the"
7,3,29,"And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man."
7,3,30,"So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years."
7,3,31,"And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel."

7,4,9,"And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the"

7,4,11,"Now Heber the Kenite,  which was  of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which  is  by Kedesh."
7,4,12,"And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor."
7,4,13,"And Sisera gathered together all his chariots,  even  nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that  were  with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon."
7,4,14,"And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this  is  the day in which the"
7,4,15,"And the"
7,4,16,"But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword;  and  there was not a man left."
7,4,17,"Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for  there was  peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite."
7,4,18,"And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle."
7,4,19,"And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him."
7,4,20,"Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No."
7,4,21,"Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died."
7,4,22,"And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her  tent , behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail  was  in his temples."
7,4,23,"So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel."
7,4,24,"And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan."
7,5,1,"Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,"

7,5,7,"The inhabitants of  the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel."
7,5,8,"They chose new gods; then  was  war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?"
7,5,9,"My heart  is  toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the"

7,5,15,"And the princes of Issachar  were  with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben  there were  great thoughts of heart."
7,5,16,"Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben  there were  great searchings of heart."
7,5,17,"Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches."
7,5,18,"Zebulun and Naphtali  were  a people  that  jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field."
7,5,19,"The kings came  and  fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money."
7,5,20,"They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera."
7,5,21,"The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength."
7,5,22,"Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones."

7,5,25,"He asked water,  and  she gave  him  milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish."
7,5,26,"She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples."
7,5,27,"At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead."
7,5,28,"The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot  so  long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?"
7,5,29,"Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,"
7,5,30,"Have they not sped? have they  not  divided the prey; to every man a damsel  or  two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides,  meet  for the necks of  them that take  the spoil?"
7,5,31,"So let all thine enemies perish, O"

7,6,3,"And  so  it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;"
7,6,4,"And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass."
7,6,5,"For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude;  for  both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it."
7,6,6,"And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the"

7,6,18,"Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set  it  before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again."
7,6,19,"And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought  it  out unto him under the oak, and presented  it ."
7,6,20,"And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay  them  upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so."
7,6,21,"Then the angel of the"

7,6,29,"And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing."
7,6,30,"Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that  was  by it."
7,6,31,"And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst  it is yet  morning: if he  be  a god, let him plead for himself, because  one  hath cast down his altar."
7,6,32,"Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar."
7,6,33,"Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel."
7,6,34,"But the Spirit of the"
7,6,35,"And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them."
7,6,36,"And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,"
7,6,37,"Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor;  and  if the dew be on the fleece only, and  it be  dry upon all the earth  beside , then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said."
7,6,38,"And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water."
7,6,39,"And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew."
7,6,40,"And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground."
7,7,1,"Then Jerubbaal, who  is  Gideon, and all the people that  were  with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley."
7,7,2,"And the"
7,7,3,"Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever  is  fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand."
7,7,4,"And the"
7,7,5,"So he brought down the people unto the water: and the"
7,7,6,"And the number of them that lapped,  putting  their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water."
7,7,7,"And the"
7,7,8,"So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all  the rest of  Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley."
7,7,9,"And it came to pass the same night, that the"
7,7,10,"But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:"
7,7,11,"And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that  were  in the host."
7,7,12,"And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels  were  without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude."
7,7,13,"And when Gideon was come, behold,  there was  a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along."
7,7,14,"And his fellow answered and said, This  is  nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel:  for  into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host."
7,7,15,"And it was  so , when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the"
7,7,16,"And he divided the three hundred men  into  three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers."
7,7,17,"And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be  that , as I do, so shall ye do."
7,7,18,"When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that  are  with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say,  The sword  of the"
7,7,19,"So Gideon, and the hundred men that  were  with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that  were  in their hands."
7,7,20,"And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow  withal : and they cried, The sword of the"
7,7,21,"And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled."
7,7,22,"And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the"
7,7,23,"And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites."
7,7,24,"And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan."
7,7,25,"And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan."
7,8,1,"And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply."
7,8,2,"And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?  Is  not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?"
7,8,3,"God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that."
7,8,4,"And Gideon came to Jordan,  and  passed over, he, and the three hundred men that  were  with him, faint, yet pursuing  them ."
7,8,5,"And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they  be  faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian."
7,8,6,"And the princes of Succoth said,  Are  the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?"
7,8,7,"And Gideon said, Therefore when the"
7,8,8,"And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered  him ."
7,8,9,"And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."
7,8,10,"Now Zebah and Zalmunna  were  in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand  men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword."
7,8,11,"And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure."
7,8,12,"And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host."
7,8,13,"And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun  was up ,"
7,8,14,"And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof,  even  threescore and seventeen men."
7,8,15,"And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying,  Are  the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men  that are  weary?"
7,8,16,"And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth."
7,8,17,"And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city."
7,8,18,"Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men  were they  whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou  art , so  were  they; each one resembled the children of a king."
7,8,19,"And he said, They  were  my brethren,  even  the sons of my mother:  as  the"
7,8,20,"And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up,  and  slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he  was  yet a youth."
7,8,21,"Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man  is, so is  his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that  were  on their camels’ necks."
7,8,22,"Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian."
7,8,23,"And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the"
7,8,24,"And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they  were  Ishmaelites.)"
7,8,25,"And they answered, We will willingly give  them . And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey."
7,8,26,"And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred  shekels  of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that  was  on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that  were  about their camels’ necks."
7,8,27,"And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city,  even  in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house."
7,8,28,"Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon."
7,8,29,"And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house."
7,8,30,"And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives."
7,8,31,"And his concubine that  was  in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech."
7,8,32,"And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites."
7,8,33,"And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god."
7,8,34,"And the children of Israel remembered not the"
7,8,35,"Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,  namely , Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel."
7,9,1,"And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother’s brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,"
7,9,2,"Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether  is  better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal,  which are  threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I  am  your bone and your flesh."
7,9,3,"And his mother’s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He  is  our brother."
7,9,4,"And they gave him threescore and ten  pieces  of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him."
7,9,5,"And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal,  being  threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself."
7,9,6,"And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that  was  in Shechem."
7,9,7,"And when they told  it  to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you."
7,9,8,"The trees went forth  on a time  to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us."
7,9,9,"But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
7,9,10,"And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou,  and  reign over us."
7,9,11,"But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
7,9,12,"Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou,  and  reign over us."
7,9,13,"And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
7,9,14,"Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou,  and  reign over us."
7,9,15,"And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you,  then  come  and  put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon."
7,9,16,"Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;"
7,9,17,"(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:"
7,9,18,"And ye are risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he  is  your brother;)"
7,9,19,"If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day,  then  rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:"
7,9,20,"But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech."
7,9,21,"And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother."
7,9,22,"When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,"
7,9,23,"Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:"
7,9,24,"That the cruelty  done  to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren."
7,9,25,"And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech."
7,9,26,"And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him."
7,9,27,"And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode  the grapes , and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech."
7,9,28,"And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who  is  Abimelech, and who  is  Shechem, that we should serve him?  is  not  he  the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?"
7,9,29,"And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out."
7,9,30,"And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled."
7,9,31,"And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee."
7,9,32,"Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that  is  with thee, and lie in wait in the field:"
7,9,33,"And it shall be,  that  in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold,  when  he and the people that  is  with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion."
7,9,34,"And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that  were  with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies."
7,9,35,"And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that  were  with him, from lying in wait."
7,9,36,"And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as  if they were  men."
7,9,37,"And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim."
7,9,38,"Then said Zebul unto him, Where  is  now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who  is  Abimelech, that we should serve him?  is  not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them."
7,9,39,"And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech."
7,9,40,"And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown  and  wounded,  even  unto the entering of the gate."
7,9,41,"And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem."
7,9,42,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech."
7,9,43,"And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people  were  come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them."
7,9,44,"And Abimelech, and the company that  was  with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two  other  companies ran upon all  the people  that  were  in the fields, and slew them."
7,9,45,"And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that  was  therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt."
7,9,46,"And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard  that , they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith."
7,9,47,"And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together."
7,9,48,"And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that  were  with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid  it  on his shoulder, and said unto the people that  were  with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste,  and  do as I  have done ."
7,9,49,"And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put  them  to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women."
7,9,50,"Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it."
7,9,51,"But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut  it  to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower."
7,9,52,"And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire."
7,9,53,"And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and all to brake his skull."
7,9,54,"Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died."
7,9,55,"And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place."
7,9,56,"Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:"
7,9,57,"And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal."
7,10,1,"And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim."
7,10,2,"And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir."
7,10,3,"And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years."
7,10,4,"And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which  are  in the land of Gilead."
7,10,5,"And Jair died, and was buried in Camon."
7,10,6,"And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the"
7,10,7,"And the anger of the"
7,10,8,"And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that  were  on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which  is  in Gilead."
7,10,9,"Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed."
7,10,10,"And the children of Israel cried unto the"
7,10,11,"And the"
7,10,12,"The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand."
7,10,13,"Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more."
7,10,14,"Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation."
7,10,15,"And the children of Israel said unto the"
7,10,16,"And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the"
7,10,17,"Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh."
7,10,18,"And the people  and  princes of Gilead said one to another, What man  is he  that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
7,11,1,"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he  was  the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah."
7,11,2,"And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and his wife’s sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house; for thou  art  the son of a strange woman."
7,11,3,"Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him."
7,11,4,"And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel."
7,11,5,"And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:"
7,11,6,"And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon."
7,11,7,"And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father’s house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?"
7,11,8,"And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
7,11,9,"And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the"
7,11,10,"And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The"
7,11,11,"Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the"
7,11,12,"And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?"
7,11,13,"And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those  lands  again peaceably."
7,11,14,"And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:"
7,11,15,"And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:"
7,11,16,"But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;"
7,11,17,"Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken  thereto . And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not  consent : and Israel abode in Kadesh."
7,11,18,"Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon  was  the border of Moab."
7,11,19,"And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place."
7,11,20,"But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel."
7,11,21,"And the"
7,11,22,"And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan."
7,11,23,"So now the"
7,11,24,"Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the"
7,11,25,"And now  art  thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,"
7,11,26,"While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that  be  along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover  them  within that time?"
7,11,27,"Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the"
7,11,28,"Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him."
7,11,29,"Then the Spirit of the"
7,11,30,"And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the"
7,11,31,"Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the"
7,11,32,"So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the"
7,11,33,"And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,  even  twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel."
7,11,34,"And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she  was his  only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter."
7,11,35,"And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the"
7,11,36,"And she said unto him, My father,  if  thou hast opened thy mouth unto the"
7,11,37,"And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows."
7,11,38,"And he said, Go. And he sent her away  for  two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains."
7,11,39,"And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her  according  to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,"
7,11,40,"That  the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year."
7,12,1,"And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire."
7,12,2,"And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands."
7,12,3,"And when I saw that ye delivered  me  not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the"
7,12,4,"Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites  are  fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites,  and  among the Manassites."
7,12,5,"And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was  so , that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him,  Art  thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;"
7,12,6,"Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce  it  right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand."
7,12,7,"And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in  one of  the cities of Gilead."
7,12,8,"And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel."
7,12,9,"And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters,  whom  he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years."
7,12,10,"Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem."
7,12,11,"And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years."
7,12,12,"And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun."
7,12,13,"And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel."
7,12,14,"And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years."
7,12,15,"And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites."
7,13,1,"And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the"
7,13,2,"And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name  was  Manoah; and his wife  was  barren, and bare not."
7,13,3,"And the angel of the"
7,13,4,"Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean  thing :"
7,13,5,"For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no rasor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines."
7,13,6,"Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance  was  like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he  was , neither told he me his name:"
7,13,7,"But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean  thing : for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death."
7,13,8,"Then Manoah intreated the"
7,13,9,"And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband  was  not with her."
7,13,10,"And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the  other  day."
7,13,11,"And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him,  Art  thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I  am ."
7,13,12,"And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and  how  shall we do unto him?"
7,13,13,"And the angel of the"
7,13,14,"She may not eat of any  thing  that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean  thing : all that I commanded her let her observe."
7,13,15,"And Manoah said unto the angel of the"
7,13,16,"And the angel of the"
7,13,17,"And Manoah said unto the angel of the"
7,13,18,"And the angel of the"
7,13,19,"So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered  it  upon a rock unto the"
7,13,20,"For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the"
7,13,21,"But the angel of the"
7,13,22,"And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God."
7,13,23,"But his wife said unto him, If the"
7,13,24,"And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the"
7,13,25,"And the Spirit of the"
7,14,1,"And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines."
7,14,2,"And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife."
7,14,3,"Then his father and his mother said unto him,  Is there  never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well."
7,14,4,"But his father and his mother knew not that it  was  of the"
7,14,5,"Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him."
7,14,6,"And the Spirit of the"
7,14,7,"And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well."
7,14,8,"And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold,  there was  a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion."
7,14,9,"And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion."
7,14,10,"So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do."
7,14,11,"And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him."
7,14,12,"And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find  it  out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:"
7,14,13,"But if ye cannot declare  it  me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it."
7,14,14,"And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle."
7,14,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have?  is it  not  so ?"
7,14,16,"And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told  it  me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told  it  my father nor my mother, and shall I tell  it  thee?"
7,14,17,"And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people."
7,14,18,"And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What  is  sweeter than honey? and what  is  stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle."
7,14,19,"And the Spirit of the"
7,14,20,"But Samson’s wife was  given  to his companion, whom he had used as his friend."
7,15,1,"But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in."
7,15,2,"And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion:  is  not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her."
7,15,3,"And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure."
7,15,4,"And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails."
7,15,5,"And when he had set the brands on fire, he let  them  go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards  and  olives."
7,15,6,"Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire."
7,15,7,"And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease."
7,15,8,"And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam."
7,15,9,"Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi."
7,15,10,"And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us."
7,15,11,"Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines  are  rulers over us? what  is  this  that  thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them."
7,15,12,"And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves."
7,15,13,"And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock."
7,15,14,"And  when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the"
7,15,15,"And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith."
7,15,16,"And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men."
7,15,17,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi."
7,15,18,"And he was sore athirst, and called on the"
7,15,19,"But God clave an hollow place that  was  in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which  is  in Lehi unto this day."
7,15,20,"And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years."
7,16,1,"Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her."
7,16,2,"And it was told  the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed  him  in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him."
7,16,3,"And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put  them  upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that  is  before Hebron."
7,16,4,"And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name  was  Delilah."
7,16,5,"And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength  lieth , and by what  means  we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred  pieces  of silver."
7,16,6,"And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength  lieth , and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee."
7,16,7,"And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."
7,16,8,"Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them."
7,16,9,"Now  there were  men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines  be  upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known."
7,16,10,"And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound."
7,16,11,"And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."
7,16,12,"Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines  be  upon thee, Samson. And  there were  liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread."
7,16,13,"And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web."
7,16,14,"And she fastened  it  with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines  be  upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web."
7,16,15,"And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart  is  not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength  lieth ."
7,16,16,"And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him,  so  that his soul was vexed unto death;"
7,16,17,"That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a rasor upon mine head; for I  have been  a Nazarite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any  other  man."
7,16,18,"And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand."
7,16,19,"And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him."
7,16,20,"And she said, The Philistines  be  upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the"
7,16,21,"But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house."
7,16,22,"Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven."
7,16,23,"Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand."
7,16,24,"And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us."
7,16,25,"And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars."
7,16,26,"And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them."
7,16,27,"Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines  were  there; and  there were  upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport."
7,16,28,"And Samson called unto the"
7,16,29,"And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left."
7,16,30,"And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with  all his  might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that  were  therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than  they  which he slew in his life."
7,16,31,"Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought  him  up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years."
7,17,1,"And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name  was  Micah."
7,17,2,"And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred  shekels  of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver  is  with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed  be thou  of the"
7,17,3,"And when he had restored the eleven hundred  shekels  of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the"
7,17,4,"Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred  shekels  of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah."
7,17,5,"And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest."
7,17,6,"In those days  there was  no king in Israel,  but  every man did  that which was  right in his own eyes."
7,17,7,"And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who  was  a Levite, and he sojourned there."
7,17,8,"And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find  a place : and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed."
7,17,9,"And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I  am  a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find  a place ."
7,17,10,"And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten  shekels  of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in."
7,17,11,"And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons."
7,17,12,"And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah."
7,17,13,"Then said Micah, Now know I that the"
7,18,1,"In those days  there was  no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day  all their  inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel."
7,18,2,"And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there."
7,18,3,"When they  were  by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this  place ? and what hast thou here?"
7,18,4,"And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest."
7,18,5,"And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous."
7,18,6,"And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the"
7,18,7,"Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that  were  therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and  there was  no magistrate in the land, that might put  them  to shame in  any  thing; and they  were  far from the Zidonians, and had no business with  any  man."
7,18,8,"And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What  say  ye?"
7,18,9,"And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it  is  very good: and  are  ye still? be not slothful to go,  and  to enter to possess the land."
7,18,10,"When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where  there is  no want of any thing that  is  in the earth."
7,18,11,"And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war."
7,18,12,"And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold,  it is  behind Kirjathjearim."
7,18,13,"And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah."
7,18,14,"Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do."
7,18,15,"And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite,  even  unto the house of Micah, and saluted him."
7,18,16,"And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which  were  of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate."
7,18,17,"And the five men that went to spy out the land went up,  and  came in thither,  and  took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men  that were  appointed with weapons of war."
7,18,18,"And these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?"
7,18,19,"And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest:  is it  better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?"
7,18,20,"And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people."
7,18,21,"So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them."
7,18,22,"And  when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that  were  in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan."
7,18,23,"And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?"
7,18,24,"And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what  is  this  that  ye say unto me, What aileth thee?"
7,18,25,"And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household."
7,18,26,"And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they  were  too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house."
7,18,27,"And they took  the things  which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people  that were  at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire."
7,18,28,"And  there was  no deliverer, because it  was  far from Zidon, and they had no business with  any  man; and it was in the valley that  lieth  by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein."
7,18,29,"And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city  was  Laish at the first."
7,18,30,"And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land."
7,18,31,"And they set them up Micah’s graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh."
7,19,1,"And it came to pass in those days, when  there was  no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah."
7,19,2,"And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father’s house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months."
7,19,3,"And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her,  and  to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father’s house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him."
7,19,4,"And his father in law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there."
7,19,5,"And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel’s father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way."
7,19,6,"And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel’s father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry."
7,19,7,"And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again."
7,19,8,"And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel’s father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them."
7,19,9,"And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel’s father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home."
7,19,10,"But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which  is  Jerusalem; and  there were  with him two asses saddled, his concubine also  was  with him."
7,19,11,"And  when they  were  by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it."
7,19,12,"And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that  is  not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah."
7,19,13,"And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah."
7,19,14,"And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them  when they were  by Gibeah, which  belongeth  to Benjamin."
7,19,15,"And they turned aside thither, to go in  and  to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for  there was  no man that took them into his house to lodging."
7,19,16,"And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which  was  also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place  were  Benjamites."
7,19,17,"And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?"
7,19,18,"And he said unto him, We  are  passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence  am  I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I  am now  going to the house of the"
7,19,19,"Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man  which is  with thy servants:  there is  no want of any thing."
7,19,20,"And the old man said, Peace  be  with thee; howsoever  let  all thy wants  lie  upon me; only lodge not in the street."
7,19,21,"So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink."
7,19,22,"Now  as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about,  and  beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him."
7,19,23,"And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren,  nay , I pray you, do not  so  wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly."
7,19,24,"Behold,  here is  my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing."
7,19,25,"But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go."
7,19,26,"Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord  was , till it was light."
7,19,27,"And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down  at  the door of the house, and her hands  were  upon the threshold."
7,19,28,"And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her  up  upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place."
7,19,29,"And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her,  together  with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel."
7,19,30,"And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak  your minds ."
7,20,1,"Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the"
7,20,2,"And the chief of all the people,  even  of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword."
7,20,3,"(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell  us , how was this wickedness?"
7,20,4,"And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that  belongeth  to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge."
7,20,5,"And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night,  and  thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead."
7,20,6,"And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel."
7,20,7,"Behold, ye  are  all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel."
7,20,8,"And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any  of us  go to his tent, neither will we any  of us  turn into his house."
7,20,9,"But now this  shall be  the thing which we will do to Gibeah;  we will go up  by lot against it;"
7,20,10,"And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel."
7,20,11,"So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man."
7,20,12,"And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness  is  this that is done among you?"
7,20,13,"Now therefore deliver  us  the men, the children of Belial, which  are  in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel:"
7,20,14,"But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel."
7,20,15,"And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men."
7,20,16,"Among all this people  there were  seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair  breadth , and not miss."
7,20,17,"And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these  were  men of war."
7,20,18,"And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the"
7,20,19,"And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah."
7,20,20,"And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah."
7,20,21,"And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men."
7,20,22,"And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day."
7,20,23,"(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the"
7,20,24,"And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day."
7,20,25,"And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword."
7,20,26,"Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the"
7,20,27,"And the children of Israel inquired of the"
7,20,28,"And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the"
7,20,29,"And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah."
7,20,30,"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times."
7,20,31,"And the children of Benjamin went out against the people,  and  were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people,  and  kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel."
7,20,32,"And the children of Benjamin said, They  are  smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways."
7,20,33,"And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places,  even  out of the meadows of Gibeah."
7,20,34,"And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil  was  near them."
7,20,35,"And the"
7,20,36,"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah."
7,20,37,"And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew  themselves  along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword."
7,20,38,"Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city."
7,20,39,"And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite  and  kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as  in  the first battle."
7,20,40,"But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven."
7,20,41,"And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them."
7,20,42,"Therefore they turned  their backs  before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which  came  out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them."
7,20,43,"Thus  they inclosed the Benjamites round about,  and  chased them,  and  trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising."
7,20,44,"And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these  were  men of valour."
7,20,45,"And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them."
7,20,46,"So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these  were  men of valour."
7,20,47,"But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months."
7,20,48,"And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of  every  city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to."
7,21,1,"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife."
7,21,2,"And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;"
7,21,3,"And said, O"
7,21,4,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings."
7,21,5,"And the children of Israel said, Who  is there  among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the"
7,21,6,"And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day."
7,21,7,"How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the"
7,21,8,"And they said, What one  is there  of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the"
7,21,9,"For the people were numbered, and, behold,  there were  none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there."
7,21,10,"And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children."
7,21,11,"And this  is  the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man."
7,21,12,"And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which  is  in the land of Canaan."
7,21,13,"And the whole congregation sent  some  to speak to the children of Benjamin that  were  in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them."
7,21,14,"And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not."
7,21,15,"And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the"
7,21,16,"Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?"
7,21,17,"And they said,  There must be  an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel."
7,21,18,"Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed  be  he that giveth a wife to Benjamin."
7,21,19,"Then they said, Behold,  there is  a feast of the"
7,21,20,"Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;"
7,21,21,"And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin."
7,21,22,"And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time,  that  ye should be guilty."
7,21,23,"And the children of Benjamin did so, and took  them  wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them."
7,21,24,"And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance."
7,21,25,"In those days  there was  no king in Israel: every man did  that which was  right in his own eyes."
8,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons."
8,1,2,"And the name of the man  was  Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there."
8,1,3,"And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons."
8,1,4,"And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one  was  Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years."
8,1,5,"And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband."
8,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the"
8,1,7,"Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah."
8,1,8,"And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the"
8,1,9,"The"
8,1,10,"And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people."
8,1,11,"And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?  are  there yet  any more  sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
8,1,12,"Turn again, my daughters, go  your way ; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope,  if  I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;"
8,1,13,"Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the"
8,1,14,"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her."
8,1,15,"And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law."
8,1,16,"And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee,  or  to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people  shall be  my people, and thy God my God:"
8,1,17,"Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the"
8,1,18,"When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her."
8,1,19,"So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said,  Is  this Naomi?"
8,1,20,"And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me."
8,1,21,"I went out full, and the"
8,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest."
8,2,1,"And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name  was  Boaz."
8,2,2,"And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after  him  in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter."
8,2,3,"And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field  belonging  unto Boaz, who  was  of the kindred of Elimelech."
8,2,4,"And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The"
8,2,5,"Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel  is  this?"
8,2,6,"And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It  is  the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:"
8,2,7,"And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house."
8,2,8,"Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:"
8,2,9,"Let  thine eyes  be  on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of  that  which the young men have drawn."
8,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I  am  a stranger?"
8,2,11,"And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and  how  thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore."
8,2,12,"The"
8,2,13,"Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens."
8,2,14,"And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched  corn , and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left."
8,2,15,"And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:"
8,2,16,"And let fall also  some  of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave  them , that she may glean  them , and rebuke her not."
8,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley."
8,2,18,"And she took  it  up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed."
8,2,19,"And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to day  is  Boaz."
8,2,20,"And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed  be  he of the"
8,2,21,"And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest."
8,2,22,"And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law,  It is  good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field."
8,2,23,"So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law."
8,3,1,"Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?"
8,3,2,"And now  is  not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor."
8,3,3,"Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor:  but  make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking."
8,3,4,"And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do."
8,3,5,"And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do."
8,3,6,"And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her."
8,3,7,"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down."
8,3,8,"And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet."
8,3,9,"And he said, Who  art  thou? And she answered, I  am  Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou  art  a near kinsman."
8,3,10,"And he said, Blessed  be  thou of the"
8,3,11,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou  art  a virtuous woman."
8,3,12,"And now it is true that I  am thy  near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I."
8,3,13,"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning,  that  if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee,  as  the"
8,3,14,"And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor."
8,3,15,"Also he said, Bring the vail that  thou hast  upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six  measures  of barley, and laid  it  on her: and she went into the city."
8,3,16,"And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who  art  thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her."
8,3,17,"And she said, These six  measures  of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law."
8,3,18,"Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day."
8,4,1,"Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down."
8,4,2,"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down."
8,4,3,"And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which  was  our brother Elimelech’s:"
8,4,4,"And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy  it  before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem  it , redeem  it : but if thou wilt not redeem  it, then  tell me, that I may know: for  there is  none to redeem  it  beside thee; and I  am  after thee. And he said, I will redeem  it ."
8,4,5,"Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy  it  also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance."
8,4,6,"And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem  it  for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem  it ."
8,4,7,"Now this  was the manner  in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave  it  to his neighbour: and this  was  a testimony in Israel."
8,4,8,"Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy  it  for thee. So he drew off his shoe."
8,4,9,"And Boaz said unto the elders, and  unto  all the people, Ye  are  witnesses this day, that I have bought all that  was  Elimelech’s, and all that  was  Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi."
8,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye  are  witnesses this day."
8,4,11,"And all the people that  were  in the gate, and the elders, said,  We are  witnesses. The"
8,4,12,"And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the"
8,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the"
8,4,14,"And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed  be  the"
8,4,15,"And he shall be unto thee a restorer of  thy  life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him."
8,4,16,"And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it."
8,4,17,"And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he  is  the father of Jesse, the father of David."
8,4,18,"Now these  are  the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,"
8,4,19,"And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,"
8,4,20,"And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,"
8,4,21,"And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,"
8,4,22,"And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David."
9,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name  was  Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:"
9,1,2,"And he had two wives; the name of the one  was  Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
9,1,3,"And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the"
9,1,4,"And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:"
9,1,5,"But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the"
9,1,6,"And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the"
9,1,7,"And  as  he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the"
9,1,8,"Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved?  am  not I better to thee than ten sons?"
9,1,9,"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the"
9,1,10,"And she  was  in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the"
9,1,11,"And she vowed a vow, and said, O"
9,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the"
9,1,13,"Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken."
9,1,14,"And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee."
9,1,15,"And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I  am  a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the"
9,1,16,"Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto."
9,1,17,"Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant  thee  thy petition that thou hast asked of him."
9,1,18,"And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more  sad ."
9,1,19,"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the"
9,1,20,"Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel,  saying , Because I have asked him of the"
9,1,21,"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the"
9,1,22,"But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband,  I will not go up  until the child be weaned, and  then  I will bring him, that he may appear before the"
9,1,23,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the"
9,1,24,"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the"
9,1,25,"And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli."
9,1,26,"And she said, Oh my lord,  as  thy soul liveth, my lord, I  am  the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the"
9,1,27,"For this child I prayed; and the"
9,1,28,"Therefore also I have lent him to the"
9,2,1,"And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the"
9,2,2,"There is  none holy as the"
9,2,3,"Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let  not  arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the"
9,2,4,"The bows of the mighty men  are  broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength."
9,2,5,"They that were  full have hired out themselves for bread; and  they that were  hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble."
9,2,6,"The"
9,2,7,"The"
9,2,8,"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,  and  lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set  them  among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth  are  the"

9,2,10,"The adversaries of the"
9,2,11,"And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the"
9,2,12,"Now the sons of Eli  were  sons of Belial; they knew not the"
9,2,13,"And the priests’ custom with the people  was, that , when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;"
9,2,14,"And he struck  it  into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither."
9,2,15,"Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw."
9,2,16,"And  if  any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and  then  take  as much  as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him,  Nay ; but thou shalt give  it me  now: and if not, I will take  it  by force."
9,2,17,"Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the"
9,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before the"
9,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought  it  to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice."
9,2,20,"And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The"
9,2,21,"And the"
9,2,22,"Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled  at  the door of the tabernacle of the congregation."
9,2,23,"And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people."
9,2,24,"Nay, my sons; for  it is  no good report that I hear: ye make the"
9,2,25,"If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the"
9,2,26,"And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the"
9,2,27,"And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the"
9,2,28,"And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel  to be  my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?"
9,2,29,"Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded  in my  habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?"
9,2,30,"Wherefore the"
9,2,31,"Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house."
9,2,32,"And thou shalt see an enemy  in my  habitation, in all  the wealth  which  God  shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever."
9,2,33,"And the man of thine,  whom  I shall not cut off from mine altar,  shall be  to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age."
9,2,34,"And this  shall be  a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them."
9,2,35,"And I will raise me up a faithful priest,  that  shall do according to  that  which  is  in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever."
9,2,36,"And it shall come to pass,  that  every one that is left in thine house shall come  and  crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread."
9,3,1,"And the child Samuel ministered unto the"
9,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli  was  laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim,  that  he could not see;"
9,3,3,"And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the"
9,3,4,"That the"
9,3,5,"And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here  am  I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down."
9,3,6,"And the"
9,3,7,"Now Samuel did not yet know the"
9,3,8,"And the"
9,3,9,"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak,"
9,3,10,"And the"
9,3,11,"And the"
9,3,12,"In that day I will perform against Eli all  things  which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end."
9,3,13,"For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not."
9,3,14,"And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever."
9,3,15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the"
9,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here  am  I."
9,3,17,"And he said, What  is  the thing that  the"
9,3,18,"And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It  is  the"
9,3,19,"And Samuel grew, and the"
9,3,20,"And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel  was  established  to be  a prophet of the"
9,3,21,"And the"
9,4,1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek."
9,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men."
9,4,3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the"
9,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the"
9,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of the"
9,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What  meaneth  the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the"
9,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore."
9,4,8,"Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these  are  the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness."
9,4,9,"Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight."
9,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen."
9,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain."
9,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head."
9,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told  it , all the city cried out."
9,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What  meaneth  the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli."
9,4,15,"Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see."
9,4,16,"And the man said unto Eli, I  am  he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?"
9,4,17,"And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken."
9,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years."
9,4,19,"And his daughter in law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child,  near  to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her."
9,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard  it ."
9,4,21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband."
9,4,22,"And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken."
9,5,1,"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod."
9,5,2,"When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon."
9,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon  was  fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the"
9,5,4,"And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon  was  fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the"
9,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day."
9,5,6,"But the hand of the"
9,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that  it was  so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god."
9,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about  thither ."
9,5,9,"And it was  so , that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the"
9,5,10,"Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people."
9,5,11,"So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there."
9,5,12,"And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven."
9,6,1,"And the ark of the"
9,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the"
9,6,3,"And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you."
9,6,4,"Then said they, What  shall be  the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice,  according to  the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague  was  on you all, and on your lords."
9,6,5,"Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land."
9,6,6,"Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?"
9,6,7,"Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:"
9,6,8,"And take the ark of the"
9,6,9,"And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh,  then  he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that  it is  not his hand  that  smote us; it  was  a chance  that  happened to us."
9,6,10,"And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:"
9,6,11,"And they laid the ark of the"
9,6,12,"And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh,  and  went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside  to  the right hand or  to  the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh."
9,6,13,"And  they of  Bethshemesh  were  reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see  it ."
9,6,14,"And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where  there was  a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the"
9,6,15,"And the Levites took down the ark of the"
9,6,16,"And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen  it , they returned to Ekron the same day."
9,6,17,"And these  are  the golden emerods which the Philistines returned  for  a trespass offering unto the"
9,6,18,"And the golden mice,  according to  the number of all the cities of the Philistines  belonging  to the five lords,  both  of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great  stone of  Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the"
9,6,19,"And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the"
9,6,20,"And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy"
9,6,21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the"
9,7,1,"And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the"
9,7,2,"And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the"
9,7,3,"And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the"
9,7,4,"Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the"
9,7,5,"And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the"
9,7,6,"And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured  it  out before the"
9,7,7,"And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard  it , they were afraid of the Philistines."
9,7,8,"And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the"
9,7,9,"And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered  it for  a burnt offering wholly unto the"
9,7,10,"And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the"
9,7,11,"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until  they came  under Bethcar."
9,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone, and set  it  between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the"
9,7,13,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the"
9,7,14,"And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
9,7,15,"And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life."
9,7,16,"And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places."
9,7,17,"And his return  was  to Ramah; for there  was  his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the"
9,8,1,"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel."
9,8,2,"Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah:  they were  judges in Beersheba."
9,8,3,"And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment."
9,8,4,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,"
9,8,5,"And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations."
9,8,6,"But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the"
9,8,7,"And the"
9,8,8,"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee."
9,8,9,"Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them."
9,8,10,"And Samuel told all the words of the"
9,8,11,"And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint  them  for himself, for his chariots, and  to be  his horsemen; and  some  shall run before his chariots."
9,8,12,"And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and  will set them  to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots."
9,8,13,"And he will take your daughters  to be  confectionaries, and  to be  cooks, and  to be  bakers."
9,8,14,"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards,  even  the best  of them , and give  them  to his servants."
9,8,15,"And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants."
9,8,16,"And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put  them  to his work."
9,8,17,"He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants."
9,8,18,"And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the"
9,8,19,"Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;"
9,8,20,"That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles."
9,8,21,"And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the"
9,8,22,"And the"
9,9,1,"Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name  was  Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power."
9,9,2,"And he had a son, whose name  was  Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and  there was  not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward  he was  higher than any of the people."
9,9,3,"And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses."
9,9,4,"And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found  them  not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and  there they were  not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found  them  not."
9,9,5,"And  when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that  was  with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave  caring  for the asses, and take thought for us."
9,9,6,"And he said unto him, Behold now,  there is  in this city a man of God, and  he is  an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go."
9,9,7,"Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold,  if  we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and  there is  not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?"
9,9,8,"And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver:  that  will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way."
9,9,9,"(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for  he that is  now  called  a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)"
9,9,10,"Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God  was ."
9,9,11,"And  as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?"
9,9,12,"And they answered them, and said, He is; behold,  he is  before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for  there is  a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:"
9,9,13,"As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice;  and  afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him."
9,9,14,"And they went up into the city:  and  when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place."
9,9,15,"Now the"
9,9,16,"To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him  to be  captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me."
9,9,17,"And when Samuel saw Saul, the"
9,9,18,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house  is ."
9,9,19,"And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I  am  the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that  is  in thine heart."
9,9,20,"And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom  is  all the desire of Israel?  Is it  not on thee, and on all thy father’s house?"
9,9,21,"And Saul answered and said,  Am  not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?"
9,9,22,"And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which  were  about thirty persons."
9,9,23,"And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee."
9,9,24,"And the cook took up the shoulder, and  that  which  was  upon it, and set  it  before Saul. And  Samuel  said, Behold that which is left! set  it  before thee,  and  eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day."
9,9,25,"And when they were come down from the high place into the city,  Samuel  communed with Saul upon the top of the house."
9,9,26,"And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad."
9,9,27,"And  as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God."
9,10,1,"Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured  it  upon his head, and kissed him, and said,  Is it  not because the"
9,10,2,"When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?"
9,10,3,"Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:"
9,10,4,"And they will salute thee, and give thee two  loaves  of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands."
9,10,5,"After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where  is  the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:"
9,10,6,"And the Spirit of the"
9,10,7,"And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee,  that  thou do as occasion serve thee; for God  is  with thee."
9,10,8,"And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings,  and  to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do."
9,10,9,"And it was  so , that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day."
9,10,10,"And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them."
9,10,11,"And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What  is  this  that  is come unto the son of Kish?  Is  Saul also among the prophets?"
9,10,12,"And one of the same place answered and said, But who  is  their father? Therefore it became a proverb,  Is  Saul also among the prophets?"
9,10,13,"And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place."
9,10,14,"And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that  they were  no where, we came to Samuel."
9,10,15,"And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you."
9,10,16,"And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not."
9,10,17,"And Samuel called the people together unto the"
9,10,18,"And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the"
9,10,19,"And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him,  Nay , but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the"
9,10,20,"And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken."
9,10,21,"When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found."
9,10,22,"Therefore they inquired of the"
9,10,23,"And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward."
9,10,24,"And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the"
9,10,25,"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote  it  in a book, and laid  it  up before the"
9,10,26,"And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched."
9,10,27,"But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace."
9,11,1,"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee."
9,11,2,"And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this  condition  will I make  a covenant  with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it  for  a reproach upon all Israel."
9,11,3,"And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’ respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if  there be  no man to save us, we will come out to thee."
9,11,4,"Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept."
9,11,5,"And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What  aileth  the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh."
9,11,6,"And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly."
9,11,7,"And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent  them  throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the"
9,11,8,"And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand."
9,11,9,"And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by  that time  the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed  it  to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad."
9,11,10,"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you."
9,11,11,"And it was  so  on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together."
9,11,12,"And the people said unto Samuel, Who  is  he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death."
9,11,13,"And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the"
9,11,14,"Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there."
9,11,15,"And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the"
9,12,1,"And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you."
9,12,2,"And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons  are  with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day."
9,12,3,"Behold, here I  am : witness against me before the"
9,12,4,"And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man’s hand."
9,12,5,"And he said unto them, The"
9,12,6,"And Samuel said unto the people,  It is  the"
9,12,7,"Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the"
9,12,8,"When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the"
9,12,9,"And when they forgat the"
9,12,10,"And they cried unto the"
9,12,11,"And the"
9,12,12,"And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the"
9,12,13,"Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen,  and  whom ye have desired! and, behold, the"
9,12,14,"If ye will fear the"
9,12,15,"But if ye will not obey the voice of the"
9,12,16,"Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the"
9,12,17,"Is it  not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the"
9,12,18,"So Samuel called unto the"
9,12,19,"And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the"
9,12,20,"And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the"
9,12,21,"And turn ye not aside: for  then should ye go  after vain  things , which cannot profit nor deliver; for they  are  vain."
9,12,22,"For the"
9,12,23,"Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the"
9,12,24,"Only fear the"
9,12,25,"But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king."
9,13,1,"Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,"
9,13,2,"Saul chose him three thousand  men  of Israel;  whereof  two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent."
9,13,3,"And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that  was  in Geba, and the Philistines heard  of it . And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear."
9,13,4,"And all Israel heard say  that  Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and  that  Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal."
9,13,5,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which  is  on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven."
9,13,6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits."
9,13,7,"And  some of  the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he  was  yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling."
9,13,8,"And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel  had appointed : but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him."
9,13,9,"And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering."
9,13,10,"And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him."
9,13,11,"And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and  that  thou camest not within the days appointed, and  that  the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;"
9,13,12,"Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the"
9,13,13,"And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the"
9,13,14,"But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the"
9,13,15,"And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people  that were  present with him, about six hundred men."
9,13,16,"And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people  that were  present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash."
9,13,17,"And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way  that leadeth to  Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:"
9,13,18,"And another company turned the way  to  Bethhoron: and another company turned  to  the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness."
9,13,19,"Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make  them  swords or spears:"
9,13,20,"But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock."
9,13,21,"Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads."
9,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that  were  with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found."
9,13,23,"And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash."
9,14,1,"Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that  is  on the other side. But he told not his father."
9,14,2,"And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which  is  in Migron: and the people that  were  with him  were  about six hundred men;"
9,14,3,"And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the"
9,14,4,"And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison,  there was  a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one  was  Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh."
9,14,5,"The forefront of the one  was  situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah."
9,14,6,"And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the"
9,14,7,"And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that  is  in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I  am  with thee according to thy heart."
9,14,8,"Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto  these  men, and we will discover ourselves unto them."
9,14,9,"If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them."
9,14,10,"But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the"
9,14,11,"And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves."
9,14,12,"And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the"
9,14,13,"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him."
9,14,14,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land,  which  a yoke  of oxen might plow ."
9,14,15,"And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling."
9,14,16,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down  one another ."
9,14,17,"Then said Saul unto the people that  were  with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer  were  not  there ."
9,14,18,"And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel."
9,14,19,"And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that  was  in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand."
9,14,20,"And Saul and all the people that  were  with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow,  and there was  a very great discomfiture."
9,14,21,"Moreover the Hebrews  that  were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp  from the country  round about, even they also  turned  to be with the Israelites that  were  with Saul and Jonathan."
9,14,22,"Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim,  when  they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle."
9,14,23,"So the"
9,14,24,"And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed  be  the man that eateth  any  food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted  any  food."
9,14,25,"And all  they of  the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground."
9,14,26,"And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath."
9,14,27,"But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that  was  in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened."
9,14,28,"Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed  be  the man that eateth  any  food this day. And the people were faint."
9,14,29,"Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey."
9,14,30,"How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?"
9,14,31,"And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint."
9,14,32,"And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew  them  on the ground: and the people did eat  them  with the blood."
9,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the"
9,14,34,"And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay  them  here, and eat; and sin not against the"
9,14,35,"And Saul built an altar unto the"
9,14,36,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God."
9,14,37,"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day."
9,14,38,"And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day."
9,14,39,"For,  as  the"
9,14,40,"Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee."
9,14,41,"Therefore Saul said unto the"
9,14,42,"And Saul said, Cast  lots  between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken."
9,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that  was  in mine hand,  and , lo, I must die."
9,14,44,"And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan."
9,14,45,"And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid:  as  the"
9,14,46,"Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place."
9,14,47,"So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed  them ."
9,14,48,"And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them."
9,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters  were these ; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:"
9,14,50,"And the name of Saul’s wife  was  Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host  was  Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle."
9,14,51,"And Kish  was  the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner  was  the son of Abiel."
9,14,52,"And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him."
9,15,1,"Samuel also said unto Saul, The"
9,15,2,"Thus saith the"
9,15,3,"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass."
9,15,4,"And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah."
9,15,5,"And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley."
9,15,6,"And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites."
9,15,7,"And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah  until  thou comest to Shur, that  is  over against Egypt."
9,15,8,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword."
9,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all  that was  good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing  that was  vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly."
9,15,10,"Then came the word of the"
9,15,11,"It repenteth me that I have set up Saul  to be  king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the"
9,15,12,"And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal."
9,15,13,"And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed  be  thou of the"
9,15,14,"And Samuel said, What  meaneth  then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"
9,15,15,"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the"
9,15,16,"Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the"
9,15,17,"And Samuel said, When thou  wast  little in thine own sight,  wast  thou not  made  the head of the tribes of Israel, and the"
9,15,18,"And the"
9,15,19,"Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the"
9,15,20,"And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the"
9,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the"
9,15,22,"And Samuel said, Hath the"
9,15,23,"For rebellion  is as  the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness  is as  iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the"
9,15,24,"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the"
9,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the"
9,15,26,"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the"
9,15,27,"And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent."
9,15,28,"And Samuel said unto him, The"
9,15,29,"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he  is  not a man, that he should repent."
9,15,30,"Then he said, I have sinned:  yet  honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the"
9,15,31,"So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the"
9,15,32,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past."
9,15,33,"And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the"
9,15,34,"Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul."
9,15,35,"And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the"
9,16,1,"And the"
9,16,2,"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear  it , he will kill me. And the"
9,16,3,"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me  him  whom I name unto thee."
9,16,4,"And Samuel did that which the"
9,16,5,"And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the"
9,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the"
9,16,7,"But the"
9,16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the"
9,16,9,"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the"
9,16,10,"Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The"
9,16,11,"And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all  thy  children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither."
9,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he  was  ruddy,  and  withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the"
9,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the"
9,16,14,"But the Spirit of the"
9,16,15,"And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee."
9,16,16,"Let our lord now command thy servants,  which are  before thee, to seek out a man,  who is  a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well."
9,16,17,"And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring  him  to me."
9,16,18,"Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite,  that is  cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the"
9,16,19,"Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which  is  with the sheep."
9,16,20,"And Jesse took an ass  laden  with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent  them  by David his son unto Saul."
9,16,21,"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer."
9,16,22,"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight."
9,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the  evil  spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."
9,17,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which  belongeth  to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim."
9,17,2,"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines."
9,17,3,"And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and  there was  a valley between them."
9,17,4,"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height  was  six cubits and a span."
9,17,5,"And  he had  an helmet of brass upon his head, and he  was  armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat  was  five thousand shekels of brass."
9,17,6,"And  he had  greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders."
9,17,7,"And the staff of his spear  was  like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head  weighed  six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him."
9,17,8,"And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set  your  battle in array?  am  not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me."
9,17,9,"If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us."
9,17,10,"And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together."
9,17,11,"When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid."
9,17,12,"Now David  was  the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name  was  Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men  for  an old man in the days of Saul."
9,17,13,"And the three eldest sons of Jesse went  and  followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle  were  Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah."
9,17,14,"And David  was  the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul."
9,17,15,"But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem."
9,17,16,"And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days."
9,17,17,"And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched  corn , and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;"
9,17,18,"And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of  their  thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge."
9,17,19,"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel,  were  in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines."
9,17,20,"And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle."
9,17,21,"For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army."
9,17,22,"And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren."
9,17,23,"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard  them ."
9,17,24,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid."
9,17,25,"And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be,  that  the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel."
9,17,26,"And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who  is  this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
9,17,27,"And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him."
9,17,28,"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle."
9,17,29,"And David said, What have I now done?  Is there  not a cause?"
9,17,30,"And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner."
9,17,31,"And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed  them  before Saul: and he sent for him."
9,17,32,"And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
9,17,33,"And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou  art but  a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."
9,17,34,"And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:"
9,17,35,"And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered  it  out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught  him  by his beard, and smote him, and slew him."
9,17,36,"Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God."
9,17,37,"David said moreover, The"
9,17,38,"And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail."
9,17,39,"And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved  it . And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved  them . And David put them off him."
9,17,40,"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling  was  in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine."
9,17,41,"And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield  went  before him."
9,17,42,"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was  but  a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance."
9,17,43,"And the Philistine said unto David,  Am  I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods."
9,17,44,"And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field."
9,17,45,"Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the"
9,17,46,"This day will the"
9,17,47,"And all this assembly shall know that the"
9,17,48,"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine."
9,17,49,"And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang  it , and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth."
9,17,50,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but  there was  no sword in the hand of David."
9,17,51,"Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled."
9,17,52,"And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron."
9,17,53,"And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents."
9,17,54,"And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent."
9,17,55,"And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son  is  this youth? And Abner said,  As  thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell."
9,17,56,"And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling  is ."
9,17,57,"And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand."
9,17,58,"And Saul said to him, Whose son  art  thou,  thou  young man? And David answered,  I am  the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."
9,18,1,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul."
9,18,2,"And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house."
9,18,3,"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul."
9,18,4,"And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that  was  upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle."
9,18,5,"And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him,  and  behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants."
9,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick."
9,18,7,"And the women answered  one another  as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands."
9,18,8,"And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed  but  thousands: and  what  can he have more but the kingdom?"
9,18,9,"And Saul eyed David from that day and forward."
9,18,10,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and  there was  a javelin in Saul’s hand."
9,18,11,"And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall  with it . And David avoided out of his presence twice."
9,18,12,"And Saul was afraid of David, because the"
9,18,13,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people."
9,18,14,"And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the"
9,18,15,"Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him."
9,18,16,"But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them."
9,18,17,"And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the"
9,18,18,"And David said unto Saul, Who  am  I? and what  is  my life,  or  my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?"
9,18,19,"But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife."
9,18,20,"And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him."
9,18,21,"And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in  the one of  the twain."
9,18,22,"And Saul commanded his servants,  saying , Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king’s son in law."
9,18,23,"And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you  a  light  thing  to be a king’s son in law, seeing that I  am  a poor man, and lightly esteemed?"
9,18,24,"And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David."
9,18,25,"And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines."
9,18,26,"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son in law: and the days were not expired."
9,18,27,"Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king’s son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife."
9,18,28,"And Saul saw and knew that the"
9,18,29,"And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David’s enemy continually."
9,18,30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth,  that  David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by."
9,19,1,"And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David."
9,19,2,"But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret  place , and hide thyself:"
9,19,3,"And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou  art , and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee."
9,19,4,"And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works  have been  to theeward very good:"
9,19,5,"For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the"
9,19,6,"And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware,  As  the"
9,19,7,"And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past."
9,19,8,"And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him."
9,19,9,"And the evil spirit from the"
9,19,10,"And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night."
9,19,11,"Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David’s wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain."
9,19,12,"So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped."
9,19,13,"And Michal took an image, and laid  it  in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’  hair  for his bolster, and covered  it  with a cloth."
9,19,14,"And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He  is  sick."
9,19,15,"And Saul sent the messengers  again  to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him."
9,19,16,"And when the messengers were come in, behold,  there was  an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats’  hair  for his bolster."
9,19,17,"And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?"
9,19,18,"So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth."
9,19,19,"And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David  is  at Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,20,"And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing  as  appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied."
9,19,21,"And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also."
9,19,22,"Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that  is  in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where  are  Samuel and David? And  one  said, Behold,  they be  at Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,23,"And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,24,"And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say,  Is  Saul also among the prophets?"
9,20,1,"And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what  is  mine iniquity? and what  is  my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?"
9,20,2,"And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it  is  not  so ."
9,20,3,"And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly  as  the"
9,20,4,"Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do  it  for thee."
9,20,5,"And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow  is  the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third  day  at even."
9,20,6,"If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked  leave  of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for  there is  a yearly sacrifice there for all the family."
9,20,7,"If he say thus,  It is  well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth,  then  be sure that evil is determined by him."
9,20,8,"Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the"
9,20,9,"And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?"
9,20,10,"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what  if  thy father answer thee roughly?"
9,20,11,"And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field."
9,20,12,"And Jonathan said unto David, O"
9,20,13,"The"
9,20,14,"And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the"
9,20,15,"But  also  thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the"
9,20,16,"So Jonathan made  a covenant  with the house of David,  saying , Let the"
9,20,17,"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul."
9,20,18,"Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow  is  the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty."
9,20,19,"And  when  thou hast stayed three days,  then  thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was  in hand , and shalt remain by the stone Ezel."
9,20,20,"And I will shoot three arrows on the side  thereof , as though I shot at a mark."
9,20,21,"And, behold, I will send a lad,  saying , Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows  are  on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for  there is  peace to thee, and no hurt;  as  the"
9,20,22,"But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows  are  beyond thee; go thy way: for the"
9,20,23,"And  as touching  the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the"
9,20,24,"So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat."
9,20,25,"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times,  even  upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and David’s place was empty."
9,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he  is  not clean; surely he  is  not clean."
9,20,27,"And it came to pass on the morrow,  which was  the second  day  of the month, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?"
9,20,28,"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked  leave  of me  to go  to Bethlehem:"
9,20,29,"And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me  to be there : and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king’s table."
9,20,30,"Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious  woman , do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?"
9,20,31,"For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die."
9,20,32,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?"
9,20,33,"And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David."
9,20,34,"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame."
9,20,35,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him."
9,20,36,"And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot.  And  as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him."
9,20,37,"And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said,  Is  not the arrow beyond thee?"
9,20,38,"And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master."
9,20,39,"But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter."
9,20,40,"And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry  them  to the city."
9,20,41,"And  as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of  a place  toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded."
9,20,42,"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the"
9,21,1,"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why  art  thou alone, and no man with thee?"
9,21,2,"And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed  my  servants to such and such a place."
9,21,3,"Now therefore what is under thine hand? give  me  five  loaves of  bread in mine hand, or what there is present."
9,21,4,"And the priest answered David, and said,  There is  no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women."
9,21,5,"And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women  have been  kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and  the bread is  in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel."
9,21,6,"So the priest gave him hallowed  bread : for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the"
9,21,7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul  was  there that day, detained before the"
9,21,8,"And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste."
9,21,9,"And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it  is here  wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take  it : for  there is  no other save that here. And David said,  There is  none like that; give it me."
9,21,10,"And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath."
9,21,11,"And the servants of Achish said unto him,  Is  not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?"
9,21,12,"And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath."
9,21,13,"And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard."
9,21,14,"Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore  then  have ye brought him to me?"
9,21,15,"Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this  fellow  to play the mad man in my presence? shall this  fellow  come into my house?"
9,22,1,"David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard  it , they went down thither to him."
9,22,2,"And every one  that was  in distress, and every one that  was  in debt, and every one  that was  discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men."
9,22,3,"And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth,  and be  with you, till I know what God will do for me."
9,22,4,"And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold."
9,22,5,"And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth."
9,22,6,"When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that  were  with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants  were  standing about him;)"
9,22,7,"Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards,  and  make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;"
9,22,8,"That all of you have conspired against me, and  there is  none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and  there is  none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
9,22,9,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."
9,22,10,"And he inquired of the"
9,22,11,"Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that  were  in Nob: and they came all of them to the king."
9,22,12,"And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I  am , my lord."
9,22,13,"And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
9,22,14,"Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who  is so  faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king’s son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?"
9,22,15,"Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute  any  thing unto his servant,  nor  to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more."
9,22,16,"And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father’s house."
9,22,17,"And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the"
9,22,18,"And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod."
9,22,19,"And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword."
9,22,20,"And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David."
9,22,21,"And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the"
9,22,22,"And David said unto Abiathar, I knew  it  that day, when Doeg the Edomite  was  there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned  the death  of all the persons of thy father’s house."
9,22,23,"Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou  shalt be  in safeguard."
9,23,1,"Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors."
9,23,2,"Therefore David inquired of the"
9,23,3,"And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"
9,23,4,"Then David inquired of the"
9,23,5,"So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah."
9,23,6,"And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah,  that  he came down  with  an ephod in his hand."
9,23,7,"And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars."
9,23,8,"And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men."
9,23,9,"And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod."
9,23,10,"Then said David, O"
9,23,11,"Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O"
9,23,12,"Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the"
9,23,13,"Then David and his men,  which were  about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth."
9,23,14,"And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand."
9,23,15,"And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David  was  in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood."
9,23,16,"And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God."
9,23,17,"And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth."
9,23,18,"And they two made a covenant before the"
9,23,19,"Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which  is  on the south of Jeshimon?"
9,23,20,"Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part  shall be  to deliver him into the king’s hand."
9,23,21,"And Saul said, Blessed  be  ye of the"
9,23,22,"Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is,  and  who hath seen him there: for it is told me  that  he dealeth very subtilly."
9,23,23,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah."
9,23,24,"And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men  were  in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon."
9,23,25,"Saul also and his men went to seek  him . And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard  that , he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon."
9,23,26,"And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them."
9,23,27,"But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land."
9,23,28,"Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth."
9,23,29,"And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi."
9,24,1,"And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David  is  in the wilderness of Engedi."
9,24,2,"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats."
9,24,3,"And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where  was  a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave."
9,24,4,"And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the"
9,24,5,"And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt."
9,24,6,"And he said unto his men, The"
9,24,7,"So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on  his  way."
9,24,8,"David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself."
9,24,9,"And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?"
9,24,10,"Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the"
9,24,11,"Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that  there is  neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it."
9,24,12,"The"
9,24,13,"As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee."
9,24,14,"After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea."
9,24,15,"The"
9,24,16,"And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said,  Is  this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept."
9,24,17,"And he said to David, Thou  art  more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil."
9,24,18,"And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the"
9,24,19,"For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the"
9,24,20,"And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand."
9,24,21,"Swear now therefore unto me by the"
9,24,22,"And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold."
9,25,1,"And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran."
9,25,2,"And  there was  a man in Maon, whose possessions  were  in Carmel; and the man  was  very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel."
9,25,3,"Now the name of the man  was  Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and  she was  a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man  was  churlish and evil in his doings; and he  was  of the house of Caleb."
9,25,4,"And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep."
9,25,5,"And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:"
9,25,6,"And thus shall ye say to him that liveth  in prosperity , Peace  be  both to thee, and peace  be  to thine house, and peace  be  unto all that thou hast."
9,25,7,"And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel."
9,25,8,"Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David."
9,25,9,"And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased."
9,25,10,"And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who  is  David? and who  is  the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master."
9,25,11,"Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give  it  unto men, whom I know not whence they  be ?"
9,25,12,"So David’s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings."
9,25,13,"And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff."
9,25,14,"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them."
9,25,15,"But the men  were  very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:"
9,25,16,"They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep."
9,25,17,"Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he  is such  a son of Belial, that  a man  cannot speak to him."
9,25,18,"Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched  corn , and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid  them  on asses."
9,25,19,"And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal."
9,25,20,"And it was  so, as  she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them."
9,25,21,"Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this  fellow  hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that  pertained  unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good."
9,25,22,"So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that  pertain  to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall."
9,25,23,"And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,"
9,25,24,"And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord,  upon  me  let this  iniquity  be : and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid."
9,25,25,"Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial,  even  Nabal: for as his name  is , so  is  he; Nabal  is  his name, and folly  is  with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send."
9,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord,  as  the"
9,25,27,"And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord."
9,25,28,"I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the"
9,25,29,"Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the"
9,25,30,"And it shall come to pass, when the"
9,25,31,"That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the"
9,25,32,"And David said to Abigail, Blessed  be  the"
9,25,33,"And blessed  be  thy advice, and blessed  be  thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to  shed  blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand."
9,25,34,"For in very deed,  as  the"
9,25,35,"So David received of her hand  that  which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person."
9,25,36,"And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart  was  merry within him, for he  was  very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light."
9,25,37,"But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became  as  a stone."
9,25,38,"And it came to pass about ten days  after , that the"
9,25,39,"And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed  be  the"
9,25,40,"And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife."
9,25,41,"And she arose, and bowed herself on  her  face to the earth, and said, Behold,  let  thine handmaid  be  a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."
9,25,42,"And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife."
9,25,43,"David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives."
9,25,44,"But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which  was  of Gallim."
9,26,1,"And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah,  which is  before Jeshimon?"
9,26,2,"Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph."
9,26,3,"And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which  is  before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness."
9,26,4,"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed."
9,26,5,"And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him."
9,26,6,"Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee."
9,26,7,"So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him."
9,26,8,"Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not  smite  him the second time."
9,26,9,"And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the"
9,26,10,"David said furthermore,  As  the"
9,26,11,"The"
9,26,12,"So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw  it , nor knew  it , neither awaked: for they  were  all asleep; because a deep sleep from the"
9,26,13,"Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space  being  between them:"
9,26,14,"And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who  art  thou  that  criest to the king?"
9,26,15,"And David said to Abner,  Art  not thou a  valiant  man? and who  is  like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord."
9,26,16,"This thing  is  not good that thou hast done.  As  the"
9,26,17,"And Saul knew David’s voice, and said,  Is  this thy voice, my son David? And David said,  It is  my voice, my lord, O king."
9,26,18,"And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil  is  in mine hand?"
9,26,19,"Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the"
9,26,20,"Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the"
9,26,21,"Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly."
9,26,22,"And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it."
9,26,23,"The"
9,26,24,"And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the"
9,26,25,"Then Saul said to David, Blessed  be  thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great  things , and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place."
9,27,1,"And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul:  there is  nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand."
9,27,2,"And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that  were  with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath."
9,27,3,"And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household,  even  David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife."
9,27,4,"And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him."
9,27,5,"And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?"
9,27,6,"Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day."
9,27,7,"And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months."
9,27,8,"And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those  nations were  of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt."
9,27,9,"And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish."
9,27,10,"And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites."
9,27,11,"And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring  tidings  to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so  will be  his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines."
9,27,12,"And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever."
9,28,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men."
9,28,2,"And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever."
9,28,3,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land."
9,28,4,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa."
9,28,5,"And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled."
9,28,6,"And when Saul inquired of the"
9,28,7,"Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold,  there is  a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor."
9,28,8,"And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me  him  up, whom I shall name unto thee."
9,28,9,"And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?"
9,28,10,"And Saul sware to her by the"
9,28,11,"Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel."
9,28,12,"And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou  art  Saul."
9,28,13,"And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth."
9,28,14,"And he said unto her, What form  is  he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he  is  covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it  was  Samuel, and he stooped with  his  face to the ground, and bowed himself."
9,28,15,"And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do."
9,28,16,"Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the"
9,28,17,"And the"
9,28,18,"Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the"
9,28,19,"Moreover the"
9,28,20,"Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night."
9,28,21,"And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me."
9,28,22,"Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way."
9,28,23,"But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed."
9,28,24,"And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded  it , and did bake unleavened bread thereof:"
9,28,25,"And she brought  it  before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night."
9,29,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which  is  in Jezreel."
9,29,2,"And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish."
9,29,3,"Then said the princes of the Philistines, What  do  these Hebrews  here ? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines,  Is  not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell  unto me  unto this day?"
9,29,4,"And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master?  should it  not  be  with the heads of these men?"
9,29,5,"Is  not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?"
9,29,6,"Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely,  as  the"
9,29,7,"Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines."
9,29,8,"And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
9,29,9,"And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou  art  good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle."
9,29,10,"Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart."
9,29,11,"So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel."
9,30,1,"And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;"
9,30,2,"And had taken the women captives, that  were  therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried  them  away, and went on their way."
9,30,3,"So David and his men came to the city, and, behold,  it was  burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives."
9,30,4,"Then David and the people that  were  with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep."
9,30,5,"And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite."
9,30,6,"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the"
9,30,7,"And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David."
9,30,8,"And David inquired at the"
9,30,9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men that  were  with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed."
9,30,10,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor."
9,30,11,"And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;"
9,30,12,"And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk  any  water, three days and three nights."
9,30,13,"And David said unto him, To whom  belongest  thou? and whence  art  thou? And he said, I  am  a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick."
9,30,14,"We made an invasion  upon  the south of the Cherethites, and upon  the coast  which  belongeth  to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire."
9,30,15,"And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company."
9,30,16,"And when he had brought him down, behold,  they were  spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah."
9,30,17,"And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled."
9,30,18,"And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives."
9,30,19,"And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any  thing  that they had taken to them: David recovered all."
9,30,20,"And David took all the flocks and the herds,  which  they drave before those  other  cattle, and said, This  is  David’s spoil."
9,30,21,"And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that  were  with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them."
9,30,22,"Then answered all the wicked men and  men  of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them  ought  of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead  them  away, and depart."
9,30,23,"Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the"
9,30,24,"For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part  is  that goeth down to the battle, so  shall  his part  be  that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike."
9,30,25,"And it was  so  from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day."
9,30,26,"And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah,  even  to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the"
9,30,27,"To  them  which  were  in Bethel, and to  them  which  were  in south Ramoth, and to  them  which  were  in Jattir,"
9,30,28,"And to  them  which  were  in Aroer, and to  them  which  were  in Siphmoth, and to  them  which  were  in Eshtemoa,"
9,30,29,"And to  them  which  were  in Rachal, and to  them  which  were  in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to  them  which  were  in the cities of the Kenites,"
9,30,30,"And to  them  which  were  in Hormah, and to  them  which  were  in Chorashan, and to  them  which  were  in Athach,"
9,30,31,"And to  them  which  were  in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt."
9,31,1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa."
9,31,2,"And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul’s sons."
9,31,3,"And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers."
9,31,4,"Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it."
9,31,5,"And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him."
9,31,6,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together."
9,31,7,"And when the men of Israel that  were  on the other side of the valley, and  they  that  were  on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them."
9,31,8,"And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa."
9,31,9,"And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish  it in  the house of their idols, and among the people."
9,31,10,"And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan."
9,31,11,"And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;"
9,31,12,"All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there."
9,31,13,"And they took their bones, and buried  them  under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days."
10,1,1,"Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;"
10,1,2,"It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and  so  it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance."
10,1,3,"And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped."
10,1,4,"And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also."
10,1,5,"And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?"
10,1,6,"And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him."
10,1,7,"And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here  am  I."
10,1,8,"And he said unto me, Who  art  thou? And I answered him, I  am  an Amalekite."
10,1,9,"He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life  is  yet whole in me."
10,1,10,"So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that  was  upon his head, and the bracelet that  was  on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord."
10,1,11,"Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that  were  with him:"
10,1,12,"And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the"
10,1,13,"And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence  art  thou? And he answered, I  am  the son of a stranger, an Amalekite."
10,1,14,"And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the"
10,1,15,"And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,  and  fall upon him. And he smote him that he died."
10,1,16,"And David said unto him, Thy blood  be  upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the"
10,1,17,"And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:"
10,1,18,"(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah  the use of  the bow: behold,  it is  written in the book of Jasher.)"
10,1,19,"The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!"
10,1,20,"Tell  it  not in Gath, publish  it  not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph."
10,1,21,"Ye mountains of Gilboa,  let there be  no dew, neither  let there be  rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,  as though he had  not  been  anointed with oil."
10,1,22,"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty."
10,1,23,"Saul and Jonathan  were  lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions."
10,1,24,"Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with  other  delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel."
10,1,25,"How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,  thou wast  slain in thine high places."
10,1,26,"I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women."
10,1,27,"How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"
10,2,1,"And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the"
10,2,2,"So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s wife the Carmelite."
10,2,3,"And his men that  were  with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron."
10,2,4,"And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying,  That  the men of Jabeshgilead  were they  that buried Saul."
10,2,5,"And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed  be  ye of the"
10,2,6,"And now the"
10,2,7,"Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them."
10,2,8,"But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;"
10,2,9,"And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel."
10,2,10,"Ishbosheth Saul’s son  was  forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David."
10,2,11,"And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months."
10,2,12,"And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon."
10,2,13,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool."
10,2,14,"And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise."
10,2,15,"Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which  pertained  to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David."
10,2,16,"And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and  thrust  his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which  is  in Gibeon."
10,2,17,"And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David."
10,2,18,"And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel  was as  light of foot as a wild roe."
10,2,19,"And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner."
10,2,20,"Then Abner looked behind him, and said,  Art  thou Asahel? And he answered, I  am ."
10,2,21,"And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him."
10,2,22,"And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?"
10,2,23,"Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth  rib , that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass,  that  as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still."
10,2,24,"Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that  lieth  before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon."
10,2,25,"And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill."
10,2,26,"Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?"
10,2,27,"And Joab said,  As  God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother."
10,2,28,"So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more."
10,2,29,"And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim."
10,2,30,"And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel."
10,2,31,"But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men,  so that  three hundred and threescore men died."
10,2,32,"And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which  was in  Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day."
10,3,1,"Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker."
10,3,2,"And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;"
10,3,3,"And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;"
10,3,4,"And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;"
10,3,5,"And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron."
10,3,6,"And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul."
10,3,7,"And Saul had a concubine, whose name  was  Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and  Ishbosheth  said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?"
10,3,8,"Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said,  Am  I a dog’s head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?"
10,3,9,"So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the"
10,3,10,"To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba."
10,3,11,"And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him."
10,3,12,"And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose  is  the land? saying  also , Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand  shall be  with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee."
10,3,13,"And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face."
10,3,14,"And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul’s son, saying, Deliver  me  my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
10,3,15,"And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from  her  husband,  even  from Phaltiel the son of Laish."
10,3,16,"And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned."
10,3,17,"And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past  to be  king over you:"
10,3,18,"Now then do  it : for the"
10,3,19,"And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin."
10,3,20,"So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that  were  with him a feast."
10,3,21,"And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace."
10,3,22,"And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from  pursuing  a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner  was  not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace."
10,3,23,"When Joab and all the host that  was  with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace."
10,3,24,"Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why  is  it  that  thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?"
10,3,25,"Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest."
10,3,26,"And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew  it  not."
10,3,27,"And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth  rib , that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother."
10,3,28,"And afterward when David heard  it , he said, I and my kingdom  are  guiltless before the"
10,3,29,"Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread."
10,3,30,"So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle."
10,3,31,"And David said to Joab, and to all the people that  were  with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David  himself  followed the bier."
10,3,32,"And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept."
10,3,33,"And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?"
10,3,34,"Thy hands  were  not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men,  so  fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him."
10,3,35,"And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down."
10,3,36,"And all the people took notice  of it , and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people."
10,3,37,"For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner."
10,3,38,"And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?"
10,3,39,"And I  am  this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah  be  too hard for me: the"
10,4,1,"And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled."
10,4,2,"And Saul’s son had two men  that were  captains of bands: the name of the one  was  Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:"
10,4,3,"And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)"
10,4,4,"And Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son  that was  lame of  his  feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name  was  Mephibosheth."
10,4,5,"And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon."
10,4,6,"And they came thither into the midst of the house,  as though  they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth  rib : and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped."
10,4,7,"For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night."
10,4,8,"And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the"
10,4,9,"And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them,  As  the"
10,4,10,"When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who  thought  that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:"
10,4,11,"How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?"
10,4,12,"And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged  them  up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried  it  in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron."
10,5,1,"Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we  are  thy bone and thy flesh."
10,5,2,"Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the"
10,5,3,"So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the"
10,5,4,"David  was  thirty years old when he began to reign,  and  he reigned forty years."
10,5,5,"In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah."
10,5,6,"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither."
10,5,7,"Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same  is  the city of David."
10,5,8,"And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind,  that are  hated of David’s soul,  he shall be chief and captain . Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house."
10,5,9,"So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward."
10,5,10,"And David went on, and grew great, and the"
10,5,11,"And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house."
10,5,12,"And David perceived that the"
10,5,13,"And David took  him  more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David."
10,5,14,"And these  be  the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,"
10,5,15,"Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,"
10,5,16,"And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet."
10,5,17,"But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard  of it , and went down to the hold."
10,5,18,"The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim."
10,5,19,"And David inquired of the"
10,5,20,"And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The"
10,5,21,"And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them."
10,5,22,"And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim."
10,5,23,"And when David inquired of the"
10,5,24,"And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the"
10,5,25,"And David did so, as the"
10,6,1,"Again, David gathered together all  the  chosen  men  of Israel, thirty thousand."
10,6,2,"And David arose, and went with all the people that  were  with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the"
10,6,3,"And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that  was  in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart."
10,6,4,"And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which  was  at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark."
10,6,5,"And David and all the house of Israel played before the"
10,6,6,"And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth  his hand  to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook  it ."
10,6,7,"And the anger of the"
10,6,8,"And David was displeased, because the"
10,6,9,"And David was afraid of the"
10,6,10,"So David would not remove the ark of the"
10,6,11,"And the ark of the"
10,6,12,"And it was told king David, saying, The"
10,6,13,"And it was  so , that when they that bare the ark of the"
10,6,14,"And David danced before the"
10,6,15,"So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the"
10,6,16,"And as the ark of the"
10,6,17,"And they brought in the ark of the"
10,6,18,"And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the"
10,6,19,"And he dealt among all the people,  even  among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece  of flesh , and a flagon  of wine . So all the people departed every one to his house."
10,6,20,"Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!"
10,6,21,"And David said unto Michal,  It was  before the"
10,6,22,"And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour."
10,6,23,"Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death."
10,7,1,"And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the"
10,7,2,"That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains."
10,7,3,"And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that  is  in thine heart; for the"
10,7,4,"And it came to pass that night, that the word of the"
10,7,5,"Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the"
10,7,6,"Whereas I have not dwelt in  any  house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle."
10,7,7,"In all  the places  wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?"
10,7,8,"Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the"
10,7,9,"And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great  men  that  are  in the earth."
10,7,10,"Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,"
10,7,11,"And as since the time that I commanded judges  to be  over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the"
10,7,12,"And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom."
10,7,13,"He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever."
10,7,14,"I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:"
10,7,15,"But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took  it  from Saul, whom I put away before thee."
10,7,16,"And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever."
10,7,17,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David."
10,7,18,"Then went king David in, and sat before the"
10,7,19,"And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord"
10,7,20,"And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord"
10,7,21,"For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know  them ."
10,7,22,"Wherefore thou art great, O"
10,7,23,"And what one nation in the earth  is  like thy people,  even  like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt,  from  the nations and their gods?"
10,7,24,"For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel  to be  a people unto thee for ever: and thou,"
10,7,25,"And now, O"
10,7,26,"And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The"
10,7,27,"For thou, O"
10,7,28,"And now, O Lord"
10,7,29,"Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord"
10,8,1,"And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines."
10,8,2,"And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And  so  the Moabites became David’s servants,  and  brought gifts."
10,8,3,"David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates."
10,8,4,"And David took from him a thousand  chariots , and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot  horses , but reserved of them  for  an hundred chariots."
10,8,5,"And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men."
10,8,6,"Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David,  and  brought gifts. And the"
10,8,7,"And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
10,8,8,"And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass."
10,8,9,"When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,"
10,8,10,"Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And  Joram  brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:"
10,8,11,"Which also king David did dedicate unto the"
10,8,12,"Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah."
10,8,13,"And David gat  him  a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt,  being  eighteen thousand  men ."
10,8,14,"And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David’s servants. And the"
10,8,15,"And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people."
10,8,16,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah  was  over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud  was  recorder;"
10,8,17,"And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar,  were  the priests; and Seraiah  was  the scribe;"
10,8,18,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada  was over  both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief rulers."
10,9,1,"And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?"
10,9,2,"And  there was  of the house of Saul a servant whose name  was  Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him,  Art  thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant  is he ."
10,9,3,"And the king said,  Is  there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son,  which is  lame on  his  feet."
10,9,4,"And the king said unto him, Where  is  he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he  is  in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar."
10,9,5,"Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar."
10,9,6,"Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!"
10,9,7,"And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually."
10,9,8,"And he bowed himself, and said, What  is  thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I  am ?"
10,9,9,"Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master’s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house."
10,9,10,"Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in  the fruits , that thy master’s son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants."
10,9,11,"Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth,  said the king , he shall eat at my table, as one of the king’s sons."
10,9,12,"And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name  was  Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba  were  servants unto Mephibosheth."
10,9,13,"So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king’s table; and was lame on both his feet."
10,10,1,"And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead."
10,10,2,"Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon."
10,10,3,"And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David  rather  sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?"
10,10,4,"Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle,  even  to their buttocks, and sent them away."
10,10,5,"When they told  it  unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and  then  return."
10,10,6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men."
10,10,7,"And when David heard of  it , he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men."
10,10,8,"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah,  were  by themselves in the field."
10,10,9,"When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice  men  of Israel, and put  them  in array against the Syrians:"
10,10,10,"And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put  them  in array against the children of Ammon."
10,10,11,"And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee."
10,10,12,"Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the"
10,10,13,"And Joab drew nigh, and the people that  were  with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him."
10,10,14,"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem."
10,10,15,"And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together."
10,10,16,"And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that  were  beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer  went  before them."
10,10,17,"And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him."
10,10,18,"And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew  the men of  seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there."
10,10,19,"And when all the kings  that were  servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more."
10,11,1,"And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth  to battle , that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem."
10,11,2,"And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman  was  very beautiful to look upon."
10,11,3,"And David sent and inquired after the woman. And  one  said,  Is  not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
10,11,4,"And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house."
10,11,5,"And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I  am  with child."
10,11,6,"And David sent to Joab,  saying , Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David."
10,11,7,"And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded  of him  how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered."
10,11,8,"And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess  of meat  from the king."
10,11,9,"But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house."
10,11,10,"And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from  thy  journey? why  then  didst thou not go down unto thine house?"
10,11,11,"And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife?  as  thou livest, and  as  thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing."
10,11,12,"And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow."
10,11,13,"And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house."
10,11,14,"And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent  it  by the hand of Uriah."
10,11,15,"And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die."
10,11,16,"And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men  were ."
10,11,17,"And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell  some  of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also."
10,11,18,"Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;"
10,11,19,"And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,"
10,11,20,"And if so be that the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?"
10,11,21,"Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
10,11,22,"So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for."
10,11,23,"And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate."
10,11,24,"And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and  some  of the king’s servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
10,11,25,"Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him."
10,11,26,"And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband."
10,11,27,"And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the"
10,12,1,"And the"
10,12,2,"The rich  man  had exceeding many flocks and herds:"
10,12,3,"But the poor  man  had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter."
10,12,4,"And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him."
10,12,5,"And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan,  As  the"
10,12,6,"And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity."
10,12,7,"And Nathan said to David, Thou  art  the man. Thus saith the"
10,12,8,"And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if  that had been  too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things."
10,12,9,"Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the"
10,12,10,"Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife."
10,12,11,"Thus saith the"
10,12,12,"For thou didst  it  secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun."
10,12,13,"And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the"
10,12,14,"Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the"
10,12,15,"And Nathan departed unto his house. And the"
10,12,16,"David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth."
10,12,17,"And the elders of his house arose,  and went  to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them."
10,12,18,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?"
10,12,19,"But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead."
10,12,20,"Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed  himself , and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the"
10,12,21,"Then said his servants unto him, What thing  is  this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child,  while it was  alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread."
10,12,22,"And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell  whether"
10,12,23,"But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me."
10,12,24,"And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the"
10,12,25,"And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the"
10,12,26,"And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city."
10,12,27,"And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters."
10,12,28,"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name."
10,12,29,"And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it."
10,12,30,"And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof  was  a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was  set  on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance."
10,12,31,"And he brought forth the people that  were  therein, and put  them  under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem."
10,13,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name  was  Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her."
10,13,2,"And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she  was  a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her."
10,13,3,"But Amnon had a friend, whose name  was  Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother: and Jonadab  was  a very subtil man."
10,13,4,"And he said unto him, Why  art  thou,  being  the king’s son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister."
10,13,5,"And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see  it , and eat  it  at her hand."
10,13,6,"So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand."
10,13,7,"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him meat."
10,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded  it , and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes."
10,13,9,"And she took a pan, and poured  them  out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him."
10,13,10,"And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought  them  into the chamber to Amnon her brother."
10,13,11,"And when she had brought  them  unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister."
10,13,12,"And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly."
10,13,13,"And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee."
10,13,14,"Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her."
10,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her  was  greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone."
10,13,16,"And she said unto him,  There is  no cause: this evil in sending me away  is  greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her."
10,13,17,"Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this  woman  out from me, and bolt the door after her."
10,13,18,"And  she had  a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king’s daughters  that were  virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her."
10,13,19,"And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that  was  on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying."
10,13,20,"And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he  is  thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house."
10,13,21,"But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth."
10,13,22,"And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar."
10,13,23,"And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which  is  beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons."
10,13,24,"And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant."
10,13,25,"And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him."
10,13,26,"Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?"
10,13,27,"But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him."
10,13,28,"Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant."
10,13,29,"And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled."
10,13,30,"And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left."
10,13,31,"Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent."
10,13,32,"And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose  that  they have slain all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar."
10,13,33,"Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead."
10,13,34,"But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him."
10,13,35,"And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy servant said, so it is."
10,13,36,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore."
10,13,37,"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And  David  mourned for his son every day."
10,13,38,"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years."
10,13,39,"And  the soul of  king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead."
10,14,1,"Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart  was  toward Absalom."
10,14,2,"And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:"
10,14,3,"And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth."
10,14,4,"And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king."
10,14,5,"And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I  am  indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead."
10,14,6,"And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and  there was  none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him."
10,14,7,"And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband  neither  name nor remainder upon the earth."
10,14,8,"And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee."
10,14,9,"And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity  be  on me, and on my father’s house: and the king and his throne  be  guiltless."
10,14,10,"And the king said, Whosoever saith  ought  unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more."
10,14,11,"Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the"
10,14,12,"Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak  one  word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on."
10,14,13,"And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished."
10,14,14,"For we must needs die, and  are  as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect  any  person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him."
10,14,15,"Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king,  it is  because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid."
10,14,16,"For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man  that would  destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God."
10,14,17,"Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so  is  my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the"
10,14,18,"Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak."
10,14,19,"And the king said,  Is not  the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said,  As  thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:"
10,14,20,"To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord  is  wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all  things  that  are  in the earth."
10,14,21,"And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again."
10,14,22,"And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant."
10,14,23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem."
10,14,24,"And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face."
10,14,25,"But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him."
10,14,26,"And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end that he polled  it : because  the hair  was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king’s weight."
10,14,27,"And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name  was  Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance."
10,14,28,"So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king’s face."
10,14,29,"Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come."
10,14,30,"Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire."
10,14,31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto  his  house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?"
10,14,32,"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur?  it had been  good for me  to have been  there still: now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be  any  iniquity in me, let him kill me."
10,14,33,"So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom."
10,15,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him."
10,15,2,"And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was  so , that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city  art  thou? And he said, Thy servant  is  of one of the tribes of Israel."
10,15,3,"And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters  are  good and right; but  there is  no man  deputed  of the king to hear thee."
10,15,4,"Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!"
10,15,5,"And it was  so , that when any man came nigh  to him  to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him."
10,15,6,"And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel."
10,15,7,"And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the"
10,15,8,"For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the"
10,15,9,"And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron."
10,15,10,"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron."
10,15,11,"And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem,  that were  called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing."
10,15,12,"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counseller, from his city,  even  from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom."
10,15,13,"And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom."
10,15,14,"And David said unto all his servants that  were  with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not  else  escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword."
10,15,15,"And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants  are ready to do  whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint."
10,15,16,"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women,  which were  concubines, to keep the house."
10,15,17,"And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off."
10,15,18,"And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king."
10,15,19,"Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou  art  a stranger, and also an exile."
10,15,20,"Whereas thou camest  but  yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth  be  with thee."
10,15,21,"And Ittai answered the king, and said,  As  the"
10,15,22,"And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that  were  with him."
10,15,23,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness."
10,15,24,"And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites  were  with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city."
10,15,25,"And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the"
10,15,26,"But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold,  here am  I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him."
10,15,27,"The king said also unto Zadok the priest,  Art not  thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar."
10,15,28,"See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me."
10,15,29,"Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there."
10,15,30,"And David went up by the ascent of  mount  Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that  was  with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up."
10,15,31,"And  one  told David, saying, Ahithophel  is  among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O"
10,15,32,"And it came to pass, that  when  David was come to the top  of the mount , where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:"
10,15,33,"Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:"
10,15,34,"But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king;  as  I  have been  thy father’s servant hitherto, so  will  I now also  be  thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel."
10,15,35,"And  hast thou  not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be,  that  what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell  it  to Zadok and Abiathar the priests."
10,15,36,"Behold,  they have  there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s  son , and Jonathan Abiathar’s  son ; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear."
10,15,37,"So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem."
10,16,1,"And when David was a little past the top  of the hill , behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred  loaves  of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine."
10,16,2,"And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses  be  for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink."
10,16,3,"And the king said, And where  is  thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father."
10,16,4,"Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine  are  all that  pertained  unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee  that  I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king."
10,16,5,"And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name  was  Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came."
10,16,6,"And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men  were  on his right hand and on his left."
10,16,7,"And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:"
10,16,8,"The"
10,16,9,"Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head."
10,16,10,"And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the"
10,16,11,"And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now  may this  Benjamite  do it ? let him alone, and let him curse; for the"
10,16,12,"It may be that the"
10,16,13,"And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill’s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust."
10,16,14,"And the king, and all the people that  were  with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there."
10,16,15,"And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him."
10,16,16,"And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king."
10,16,17,"And Absalom said to Hushai,  Is  this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?"
10,16,18,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the"
10,16,19,"And again, whom should I serve?  should I  not  serve  in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence."
10,16,20,"Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do."
10,16,21,"And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that  are  with thee be strong."
10,16,22,"So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel."
10,16,23,"And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days,  was  as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so  was  all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom."
10,17,1,"Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:"
10,17,2,"And I will come upon him while he  is  weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that  are  with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:"
10,17,3,"And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest  is  as if all returned:  so  all the people shall be in peace."
10,17,4,"And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel."
10,17,5,"Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith."
10,17,6,"And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do  after  his saying? if not; speak thou."
10,17,7,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given  is  not good at this time."
10,17,8,"For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they  be  mighty men, and they  be  chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father  is  a man of war, and will not lodge with the people."
10,17,9,"Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some  other  place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom."
10,17,10,"And he also  that is  valiant, whose heart  is  as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father  is  a mighty man, and  they  which  be  with him  are  valiant men."
10,17,11,"Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that  is  by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person."
10,17,12,"So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that  are  with him there shall not be left so much as one."
10,17,13,"Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there."
10,17,14,"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite  is  better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the"
10,17,15,"Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled."
10,17,16,"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that  are  with him."
10,17,17,"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David."
10,17,18,"Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man’s house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down."
10,17,19,"And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known."
10,17,20,"And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where  is  Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find  them , they returned to Jerusalem."
10,17,21,"And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you."
10,17,22,"Then David arose, and all the people that  were  with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan."
10,17,23,"And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled  his  ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father."
10,17,24,"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him."
10,17,25,"And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa  was  a man’s son, whose name  was  Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab’s mother."
10,17,26,"So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead."
10,17,27,"And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,"
10,17,28,"Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched  corn , and beans, and lentiles, and parched  pulse ,"
10,17,29,"And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that  were  with him, to eat: for they said, The people  is  hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness."
10,18,1,"And David numbered the people that  were  with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them."
10,18,2,"And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also."
10,18,3,"But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now  thou art  worth ten thousand of us: therefore now  it is  better that thou succour us out of the city."
10,18,4,"And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands."
10,18,5,"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,  Deal  gently for my sake with the young man,  even  with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom."
10,18,6,"So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;"
10,18,7,"Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand  men ."
10,18,8,"For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured."
10,18,9,"And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that  was  under him went away."
10,18,10,"And a certain man saw  it , and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak."
10,18,11,"And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest  him , and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten  shekels  of silver, and a girdle."
10,18,12,"And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand  shekels  of silver in mine hand,  yet  would I not put forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none  touch  the young man Absalom."
10,18,13,"Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against  me ."
10,18,14,"Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he  was  yet alive in the midst of the oak."
10,18,15,"And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him."
10,18,16,"And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people."
10,18,17,"And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent."
10,18,18,"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which  is  in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place."
10,18,19,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the"
10,18,20,"And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead."
10,18,21,"Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran."
10,18,22,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?"
10,18,23,"But howsoever,  said he , let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi."
10,18,24,"And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone."
10,18,25,"And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he  be  alone,  there is  tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near."
10,18,26,"And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold  another  man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings."
10,18,27,"And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He  is  a good man, and cometh with good tidings."
10,18,28,"And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed  be  the"
10,18,29,"And the king said,  Is  the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, and  me  thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what  it was ."
10,18,30,"And the king said  unto him , Turn aside,  and  stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still."
10,18,31,"And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the"
10,18,32,"And the king said unto Cushi,  Is  the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do  thee  hurt, be as  that  young man  is ."
10,18,33,"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10,19,1,"And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom."
10,19,2,"And the victory that day was  turned  into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son."
10,19,3,"And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle."
10,19,4,"But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10,19,5,"And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;"
10,19,6,"In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well."
10,19,7,"Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the"
10,19,8,"Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent."
10,19,9,"And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom."
10,19,10,"And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?"
10,19,11,"And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king,  even  to his house."
10,19,12,"Ye  are  my brethren, ye  are  my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?"
10,19,13,"And say ye to Amasa,  Art  thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab."
10,19,14,"And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as  the heart of  one man; so that they sent  this word  unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants."
10,19,15,"So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan."
10,19,16,"And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which  was  of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David."
10,19,17,"And  there were  a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king."
10,19,18,"And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;"
10,19,19,"And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart."
10,19,20,"For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king."
10,19,21,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the"
10,19,22,"And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I  am  this day king over Israel?"
10,19,23,"Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him."
10,19,24,"And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came  again  in peace."
10,19,25,"And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?"
10,19,26,"And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant  is  lame."
10,19,27,"And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king  is  as an angel of God: do therefore  what is  good in thine eyes."
10,19,28,"For all  of  my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?"
10,19,29,"And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land."
10,19,30,"And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house."
10,19,31,"And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan."
10,19,32,"Now Barzillai was a very aged man,  even  fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he  was  a very great man."
10,19,33,"And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem."
10,19,34,"And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?"
10,19,35,"I  am  this day fourscore years old:  and  can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?"
10,19,36,"Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?"
10,19,37,"Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city,  and be buried  by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee."
10,19,38,"And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me,  that  will I do for thee."
10,19,39,"And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place."
10,19,40,"Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel."
10,19,41,"And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David’s men with him, over Jordan?"
10,19,42,"And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king  is  near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s  cost ? or hath he given us any gift?"
10,19,43,"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more  right  in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel."
10,20,1,"And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name  was  Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel."
10,20,2,"So every man of Israel went up from after David,  and  followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem."
10,20,3,"And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women  his  concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood."
10,20,4,"Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present."
10,20,5,"So Amasa went to assemble  the men of  Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him."
10,20,6,"And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than  did  Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us."
10,20,7,"And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,8,"When they  were  at the great stone which  is  in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab’s garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle  with  a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out."
10,20,9,"And Joab said to Amasa,  Art  thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him."
10,20,10,"But Amasa took no heed to the sword that  was  in Joab’s hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth  rib , and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,11,"And one of Joab’s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that  is  for David,  let him go  after Joab."
10,20,12,"And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still."
10,20,13,"When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,14,"And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him."
10,20,15,"And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that  were  with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down."
10,20,16,"Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee."
10,20,17,"And when he was come near unto her, the woman said,  Art  thou Joab? And he answered, I  am he . Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear."
10,20,18,"Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask  counsel  at Abel: and so they ended  the matter ."
10,20,19,"I  am one of them that are  peaceable  and  faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the"
10,20,20,"And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy."
10,20,21,"The matter  is  not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king,  even  against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall."
10,20,22,"Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast  it  out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king."
10,20,23,"Now Joab  was  over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada  was  over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:"
10,20,24,"And Adoram  was  over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud  was  recorder:"
10,20,25,"And Sheva  was  scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar  were  the priests:"
10,20,26,"And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David."
10,21,1,"Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the"
10,21,2,"And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites  were  not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)"
10,21,3,"Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the"
10,21,4,"And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say,  that  will I do for you."
10,21,5,"And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us  that  we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,"
10,21,6,"Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the"
10,21,7,"But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the"
10,21,8,"But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:"
10,21,9,"And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the"
10,21,10,"And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night."
10,21,11,"And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done."
10,21,12,"And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:"
10,21,13,"And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged."
10,21,14,"And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land."
10,21,15,"Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint."
10,21,16,"And Ishbibenob, which  was  of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear  weighed  three hundred  shekels  of brass in weight, he being girded with a new  sword , thought to have slain David."
10,21,17,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel."
10,21,18,"And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which  was  of the sons of the giant."
10,21,19,"And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew  the brother of  Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear  was  like a weaver’s beam."
10,21,20,"And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of  great  stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant."
10,21,21,"And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea the brother of David slew him."
10,21,22,"These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants."
10,22,1,"And David spake unto the"
10,22,2,"And he said, The"
10,22,3,"The God of my rock; in him will I trust:  he is  my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence."
10,22,4,"I will call on the"
10,22,5,"When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;"
10,22,6,"The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;"
10,22,7,"In my distress I called upon the"
10,22,8,"Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth."
10,22,9,"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it."
10,22,10,"He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness  was  under his feet."
10,22,11,"And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind."
10,22,12,"And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,  and  thick clouds of the skies."
10,22,13,"Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled."
10,22,14,"The"
10,22,15,"And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them."
10,22,16,"And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the"
10,22,17,"He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;"
10,22,18,"He delivered me from my strong enemy,  and  from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me."
10,22,19,"They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the"
10,22,20,"He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me."
10,22,21,"The"
10,22,22,"For I have kept the ways of the"
10,22,23,"For all his judgments  were  before me: and  as for  his statutes, I did not depart from them."
10,22,24,"I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity."
10,22,25,"Therefore the"

10,22,27,"With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury."
10,22,28,"And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes  are  upon the haughty,  that  thou mayest bring  them  down."
10,22,29,"For thou  art  my lamp, O"
10,22,30,"For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall."
10,22,31,"As for  God, his way  is  perfect; the word of the"

10,22,33,"God  is  my strength  and  power: and he maketh my way perfect."
10,22,34,"He maketh my feet like hinds’  feet : and setteth me upon my high places."
10,22,35,"He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms."
10,22,36,"Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great."
10,22,37,"Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip."
10,22,38,"I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them."
10,22,39,"And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet."
10,22,40,"For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me."
10,22,41,"Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me."
10,22,42,"They looked, but  there was  none to save;  even  unto the"
10,22,43,"Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street,  and  did spread them abroad."
10,22,44,"Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me  to be  head of the heathen: a people  which  I knew not shall serve me."
10,22,45,"Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me."
10,22,46,"Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places."
10,22,47,"The"
10,22,48,"It  is  God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,"
10,22,49,"And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man."
10,22,50,"Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O"
10,22,51,"He is  the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore."
10,23,1,"Now these  be  the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man  who was  raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,"
10,23,2,"The Spirit of the"
10,23,3,"The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men  must be  just, ruling in the fear of God."
10,23,4,"And  he shall be  as the light of the morning,  when  the sun riseth,  even  a morning without clouds;  as  the tender grass  springing  out of the earth by clear shining after rain."
10,23,5,"Although my house  be  not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all  things , and sure: for  this is  all my salvation, and all  my  desire, although he make  it  not to grow."
10,23,6,"But  the sons  of Belial  shall be  all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:"
10,23,7,"But the man  that  shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the  same  place."
10,23,8,"These  be  the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same  was  Adino the Eznite:  he lift up his spear  against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time."
10,23,9,"And after him  was  Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite,  one  of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines  that  were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:"
10,23,10,"He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the"
10,23,11,"And after him  was  Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines."
10,23,12,"But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the"
10,23,13,"And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim."
10,23,14,"And David  was  then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines  was  then  in  Bethlehem."
10,23,15,"And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which  is  by the gate!"
10,23,16,"And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that  was  by the gate, and took  it , and brought  it  to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the"
10,23,17,"And he said, Be it far from me, O"
10,23,18,"And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred,  and  slew  them , and had the name among three."
10,23,19,"Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the  first  three."
10,23,20,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:"
10,23,21,"And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear."
10,23,22,"These  things  did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men."
10,23,23,"He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the  first  three. And David set him over his guard."
10,23,24,"Asahel the brother of Joab  was  one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,"
10,23,25,"Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,"
10,23,26,"Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,"

10,24,1,"And again the anger of the"
10,24,2,"For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which  was  with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people."
10,24,3,"And Joab said unto the king, Now the"
10,24,4,"Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel."
10,24,5,"And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that  lieth  in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:"
10,24,6,"Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,"
10,24,7,"And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah,  even  to Beersheba."
10,24,8,"So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days."
10,24,9,"And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah  were  five hundred thousand men."
10,24,10,"And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the"

10,24,14,"And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the"

10,24,22,"And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what  seemeth  good unto him: behold,  here be  oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and  other  instruments of the oxen for wood."
10,24,23,"All these  things  did Araunah,  as  a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The"

11,1,2,"Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat."
11,1,3,"So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king."
11,1,4,"And the damsel  was  very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not."
11,1,5,"Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him."
11,1,6,"And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also  was a  very goodly  man ; and  his mother  bare him after Absalom."
11,1,7,"And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped  him ."
11,1,8,"But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which  belonged  to David, were not with Adonijah."
11,1,9,"And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which  is  by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants:"
11,1,10,"But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not."
11,1,11,"Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth  it  not?"
11,1,12,"Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon."
11,1,13,"Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?"
11,1,14,"Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words."
11,1,15,"And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king."
11,1,16,"And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?"
11,1,17,"And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the"
11,1,18,"And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest  it  not:"
11,1,19,"And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called."
11,1,20,"And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel  are  upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him."
11,1,21,"Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders."
11,1,22,"And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in."
11,1,23,"And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground."
11,1,24,"And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?"
11,1,25,"For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah."
11,1,26,"But me,  even  me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called."
11,1,27,"Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed  it  unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
11,1,28,"Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king."
11,1,29,"And the king sware, and said,  As  the"
11,1,30,"Even as I sware unto thee by the"
11,1,31,"Then Bathsheba bowed with  her  face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever."
11,1,32,"And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king."
11,1,33,"The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:"
11,1,34,"And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon."
11,1,35,"Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah."
11,1,36,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the"
11,1,37,"As the"
11,1,38,"So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon."
11,1,39,"And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon."
11,1,40,"And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them."
11,1,41,"And Adonijah and all the guests that  were  with him heard  it  as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore  is this  noise of the city being in an uproar?"
11,1,42,"And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou  art  a valiant man, and bringest good tidings."
11,1,43,"And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king."
11,1,44,"And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:"
11,1,45,"And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This  is  the noise that ye have heard."
11,1,46,"And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom."
11,1,47,"And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed."
11,1,48,"And also thus said the king, Blessed  be  the"
11,1,49,"And all the guests that  were  with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way."
11,1,50,"And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar."
11,1,51,"And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword."
11,1,52,"And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die."
11,1,53,"So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house."
11,2,1,"Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,"
11,2,2,"I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;"
11,2,3,"And keep the charge of the"
11,2,4,"That the"
11,2,5,"Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,  and  what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that  was  about his loins, and in his shoes that  were  on his feet."
11,2,6,"Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace."
11,2,7,"But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother."
11,2,8,"And, behold,  thou hast  with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the"
11,2,9,"Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou  art  a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood."
11,2,10,"So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David."
11,2,11,"And the days that David reigned over Israel  were  forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem."
11,2,12,"Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly."
11,2,13,"And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably."
11,2,14,"He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on."
11,2,15,"And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and  that  all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the"
11,2,16,"And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on."
11,2,17,"And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife."
11,2,18,"And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king."
11,2,19,"Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand."
11,2,20,"Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee;  I pray thee , say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay."
11,2,21,"And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife."
11,2,22,"And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he  is  mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah."
11,2,23,"Then king Solomon sware by the"
11,2,24,"Now therefore,  as  the"
11,2,25,"And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died."
11,2,26,"And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou  art  worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord"
11,2,27,"So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the"
11,2,28,"Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the"
11,2,29,"And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the"
11,2,30,"And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the"
11,2,31,"And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father."
11,2,32,"And the"
11,2,33,"Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the"
11,2,34,"So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness."
11,2,35,"And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar."
11,2,36,"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither."
11,2,37,"For it shall be,  that  on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head."
11,2,38,"And Shimei said unto the king, The saying  is  good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days."
11,2,39,"And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants  be  in Gath."
11,2,40,"And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath."
11,2,41,"And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again."
11,2,42,"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the"
11,2,43,"Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the"
11,2,44,"The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the"
11,2,45,"And king Solomon  shall be  blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the"
11,2,46,"So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon."
11,3,1,"And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the"
11,3,2,"Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the"
11,3,3,"And Solomon loved the"
11,3,4,"And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that  was  the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar."
11,3,5,"In Gibeon the"
11,3,6,"And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as  it is  this day."
11,3,7,"And now, O"
11,3,8,"And thy servant  is  in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude."
11,3,9,"Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?"
11,3,10,"And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing."
11,3,11,"And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;"
11,3,12,"Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee."
11,3,13,"And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days."
11,3,14,"And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days."
11,3,15,"And Solomon awoke; and, behold,  it was  a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the"
11,3,16,"Then came there two women,  that were  harlots, unto the king, and stood before him."
11,3,17,"And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house."
11,3,18,"And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we  were  together;  there was  no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house."
11,3,19,"And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it."
11,3,20,"And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom."
11,3,21,"And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear."
11,3,22,"And the other woman said, Nay; but the living  is  my son, and the dead  is  thy son. And this said, No; but the dead  is  thy son, and the living  is  my son. Thus they spake before the king."
11,3,23,"Then said the king, The one saith, This  is  my son that liveth, and thy son  is  the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son  is  the dead, and my son  is  the living."
11,3,24,"And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king."
11,3,25,"And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other."
11,3,26,"Then spake the woman whose the living child  was  unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine,  but  divide  it ."
11,3,27,"Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she  is  the mother thereof."
11,3,28,"And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God  was  in him, to do judgment."
11,4,1,"So king Solomon was king over all Israel."
11,4,2,"And these  were  the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,"
11,4,3,"Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder."
11,4,4,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada  was  over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar  were  the priests:"
11,4,5,"And Azariah the son of Nathan  was  over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan  was  principal officer,  and  the king’s friend:"
11,4,6,"And Ahishar  was  over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda  was  over the tribute."
11,4,7,"And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision."
11,4,8,"And these  are  their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:"
11,4,9,"The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan:"
11,4,10,"The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him  pertained  Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:"
11,4,11,"The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:"
11,4,12,"Baana the son of Ahilud;  to him pertained  Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which  is  by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah,  even  unto  the place that is  beyond Jokneam:"
11,4,13,"The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him  pertained  the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which  are  in Gilead; to him  also pertained  the region of Argob, which  is  in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:"
11,4,14,"Ahinadab the son of Iddo  had  Mahanaim:"
11,4,15,"Ahimaaz  was  in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:"
11,4,16,"Baanah the son of Hushai  was  in Asher and in Aloth:"
11,4,17,"Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:"
11,4,18,"Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:"
11,4,19,"Geber the son of Uri  was  in the country of Gilead,  in  the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and  he was  the only officer which  was  in the land."
11,4,20,"Judah and Israel  were  many, as the sand which  is  by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry."
11,4,21,"And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life."
11,4,22,"And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,"
11,4,23,"Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl."
11,4,24,"For he had dominion over all  the region  on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him."
11,4,25,"And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon."
11,4,26,"And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen."
11,4,27,"And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing."
11,4,28,"Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where  the officers  were, every man according to his charge."
11,4,29,"And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that  is  on the sea shore."
11,4,30,"And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt."
11,4,31,"For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about."
11,4,32,"And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five."
11,4,33,"And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that  is  in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes."
11,4,34,"And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom."
11,5,1,"And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David."
11,5,2,"And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,"
11,5,3,"Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the"
11,5,4,"But now the"
11,5,5,"And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the"
11,5,6,"Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that  there is  not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians."
11,5,7,"And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed  be  the"
11,5,8,"And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for:  and  I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir."
11,5,9,"My servants shall bring  them  down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive  them : and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household."
11,5,10,"So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees  according to  all his desire."
11,5,11,"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat  for  food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year."
11,5,12,"And the"
11,5,13,"And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men."
11,5,14,"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon,  and  two months at home: and Adoniram  was  over the levy."
11,5,15,"And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;"
11,5,16,"Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which  were  over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work."
11,5,17,"And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones,  and  hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house."
11,5,18,"And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew  them , and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house."
11,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which  is  the second month, that he began to build the house of the"
11,6,2,"And the house which king Solomon built for the"
11,6,3,"And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits  was  the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;  and  ten cubits  was  the breadth thereof before the house."
11,6,4,"And for the house he made windows of narrow lights."
11,6,5,"And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,  against  the walls of the house round about,  both  of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:"
11,6,6,"The nethermost chamber  was  five cubits broad, and the middle  was  six cubits broad, and the third  was  seven cubits broad: for without  in the wall  of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that  the beams  should not be fastened in the walls of the house."
11,6,7,"And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe  nor  any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building."
11,6,8,"The door for the middle chamber  was  in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle  chamber , and out of the middle into the third."
11,6,9,"So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar."
11,6,10,"And  then  he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar."
11,6,11,"And the word of the"
11,6,12,"Concerning  this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:"
11,6,13,"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel."
11,6,14,"So Solomon built the house, and finished it."
11,6,15,"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling:  and  he covered  them  on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir."
11,6,16,"And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built  them  for it within,  even  for the oracle,  even  for the most holy  place ."
11,6,17,"And the house, that  is , the temple before it, was forty cubits  long ."
11,6,18,"And the cedar of the house within  was  carved with knops and open flowers: all  was  cedar; there was no stone seen."
11,6,19,"And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the"
11,6,20,"And the oracle in the forepart  was  twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and  so  covered the altar  which was of  cedar."
11,6,21,"So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold."
11,6,22,"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that  was  by the oracle he overlaid with gold."
11,6,23,"And within the oracle he made two cherubims  of  olive tree,  each  ten cubits high."
11,6,24,"And five cubits  was  the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other  were  ten cubits."
11,6,25,"And the other cherub  was  ten cubits: both the cherubims  were  of one measure and one size."
11,6,26,"The height of the one cherub  was  ten cubits, and so  was it  of the other cherub."
11,6,27,"And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the  one  wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house."
11,6,28,"And he overlaid the cherubims with gold."
11,6,29,"And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without."
11,6,30,"And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without."
11,6,31,"And for the entering of the oracle he made doors  of  olive tree: the lintel  and  side posts  were  a fifth part  of the wall ."
11,6,32,"The two doors also  were of  olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid  them  with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees."
11,6,33,"So also made he for the door of the temple posts  of  olive tree, a fourth part  of the wall ."
11,6,34,"And the two doors  were of  fir tree: the two leaves of the one door  were  folding, and the two leaves of the other door  were  folding."
11,6,35,"And he carved  thereon  cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered  them  with gold fitted upon the carved work."
11,6,36,"And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams."
11,6,37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the"
11,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which  is  the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it."
11,7,1,"But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house."
11,7,2,"He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof  was  an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars."
11,7,3,"And  it was  covered with cedar above upon the beams, that  lay  on forty five pillars, fifteen  in  a row."
11,7,4,"And  there were  windows  in  three rows, and light  was  against light  in  three ranks."
11,7,5,"And all the doors and posts  were  square, with the windows: and light  was  against light  in  three ranks."
11,7,6,"And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof  was  fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch  was  before them: and the  other  pillars and the thick beam  were  before them."
11,7,7,"Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge,  even  the porch of judgment: and  it was  covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other."
11,7,8,"And his house where he dwelt  had  another court within the porch,  which  was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken  to wife , like unto this porch."
11,7,9,"All these  were of  costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and  so  on the outside toward the great court."
11,7,10,"And the foundation  was of  costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits."
11,7,11,"And above  were  costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars."
11,7,12,"And the great court round about  was  with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the"
11,7,13,"And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre."
11,7,14,"He  was  a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father  was  a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work."
11,7,15,"For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about."
11,7,16,"And he made two chapiters  of  molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter  was  five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter  was  five cubits:"
11,7,17,"And  nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which  were  upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter."
11,7,18,"And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that  were  upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter."
11,7,19,"And the chapiters that  were  upon the top of the pillars  were  of lily work in the porch, four cubits."
11,7,20,"And the chapiters upon the two pillars  had pomegranates  also above, over against the belly which  was  by the network: and the pomegranates  were  two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter."
11,7,21,"And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz."
11,7,22,"And upon the top of the pillars  was  lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished."
11,7,23,"And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other:  it was  round all about, and his height  was  five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about."
11,7,24,"And under the brim of it round about  there were  knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops  were  cast in two rows, when it was cast."
11,7,25,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea  was set  above upon them, and all their hinder parts  were  inward."
11,7,26,"And it  was  an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths."
11,7,27,"And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits  was  the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it."
11,7,28,"And the work of the bases  was  on this  manner : they had borders, and the borders  were  between the ledges:"
11,7,29,"And on the borders that  were  between the ledges  were  lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges  there was  a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen  were  certain additions made of thin work."
11,7,30,"And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver  were  undersetters molten, at the side of every addition."
11,7,31,"And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above  was  a cubit: but the mouth thereof  was  round  after  the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it  were  gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round."
11,7,32,"And under the borders  were  four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels  were joined  to the base: and the height of a wheel  was  a cubit and half a cubit."
11,7,33,"And the work of the wheels  was  like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes,  were  all molten."
11,7,34,"And  there were  four undersetters to the four corners of one base:  and  the undersetters  were  of the very base itself."
11,7,35,"And in the top of the base  was there  a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof  were  of the same."
11,7,36,"For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about."
11,7,37,"After this  manner  he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure,  and  one size."
11,7,38,"Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths:  and  every laver was four cubits:  and  upon every one of the ten bases one laver."
11,7,39,"And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south."
11,7,40,"And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the"
11,7,41,"The two pillars, and the  two  bowls of the chapiters that  were  on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which  were  upon the top of the pillars;"
11,7,42,"And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks,  even  two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that  were  upon the pillars;"
11,7,43,"And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;"
11,7,44,"And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;"
11,7,45,"And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the"
11,7,46,"In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan."
11,7,47,"And Solomon left all the vessels  unweighed , because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out."
11,7,48,"And Solomon made all the vessels that  pertained  unto the house of the"
11,7,49,"And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right  side , and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs  of  gold,"
11,7,50,"And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers  of  pure gold; and the hinges  of  gold,  both  for the doors of the inner house, the most holy  place, and  for the doors of the house,  to wit , of the temple."
11,7,51,"So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the"
11,8,1,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the"
11,8,2,"And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which  is  the seventh month."
11,8,3,"And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark."
11,8,4,"And they brought up the ark of the"
11,8,5,"And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him,  were  with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude."
11,8,6,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the"
11,8,7,"For the cherubims spread forth  their  two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above."
11,8,8,"And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy  place  before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day."
11,8,9,"There was  nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the"
11,8,10,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy  place , that the cloud filled the house of the"
11,8,11,"So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the"
11,8,12,"Then spake Solomon, The"
11,8,13,"I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever."
11,8,14,"And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)"
11,8,15,"And he said, Blessed  be  the"
11,8,16,"Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel."
11,8,17,"And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the"
11,8,18,"And the"
11,8,19,"Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name."
11,8,20,"And the"
11,8,21,"And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein  is  the covenant of the"
11,8,22,"And Solomon stood before the altar of the"
11,8,23,"And he said,"
11,8,24,"Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled  it  with thine hand, as  it is  this day."
11,8,25,"Therefore now,"
11,8,26,"And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father."
11,8,27,"But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?"
11,8,28,"Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O"
11,8,29,"That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day,  even  toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place."
11,8,30,"And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive."
11,8,31,"If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:"
11,8,32,"Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness."
11,8,33,"When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:"
11,8,34,"Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers."
11,8,35,"When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:"
11,8,36,"Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance."
11,8,37,"If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust,  or  if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness  there be ;"
11,8,38,"What prayer and supplication soever be  made  by any man,  or  by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:"
11,8,39,"Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou,  even  thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)"
11,8,40,"That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers."
11,8,41,"Moreover concerning a stranger, that  is  not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name’s sake;"
11,8,42,"(For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;"
11,8,43,"Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as  do  thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name."
11,8,44,"If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the"
11,8,45,"Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
11,8,46,"If they sin against thee, (for  there is  no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;"
11,8,47,"Yet  if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;"
11,8,48,"And  so  return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:"
11,8,49,"Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,"
11,8,50,"And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:"
11,8,51,"For they  be  thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:"
11,8,52,"That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee."
11,8,53,"For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth,  to be  thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord"
11,8,54,"And it was  so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the"
11,8,55,"And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,"
11,8,56,"Blessed  be  the"
11,8,57,"The"
11,8,58,"That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers."
11,8,59,"And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the"
11,8,60,"That all the people of the earth may know that the"
11,8,61,"Let your heart therefore be perfect with the"

11,8,63,"And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the"
11,8,64,"The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that  was  before the house of the"
11,8,65,"And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the"
11,8,66,"On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the"
11,9,1,"And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the"
11,9,2,"That the"
11,9,3,"And the"
11,9,4,"And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee,  and  wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:"
11,9,5,"Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel."
11,9,6,"But  if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments  and  my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:"
11,9,7,"Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:"
11,9,8,"And at this house,  which  is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the"
11,9,9,"And they shall answer, Because they forsook the"
11,9,10,"And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the"
11,9,11,"( Now  Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee."
11,9,12,"And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not."
11,9,13,"And he said, What cities  are  these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day."
11,9,14,"And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold."
11,9,15,"And this  is  the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the"
11,9,16,"For  Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it  for  a present unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife."
11,9,17,"And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,"
11,9,18,"And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,"
11,9,19,"And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion."
11,9,20,"And  all the people  that were  left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which  were  not of the children of Israel,"
11,9,21,"Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day."
11,9,22,"But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they  were  men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen."
11,9,23,"These  were  the chief of the officers that  were  over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work."
11,9,24,"But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which  Solomon  had built for her: then did he build Millo."
11,9,25,"And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the"
11,9,26,"And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which  is  beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom."
11,9,27,"And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon."
11,9,28,"And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought  it  to king Solomon."
11,10,1,"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the"
11,10,2,"And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart."
11,10,3,"And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not  any  thing hid from the king, which he told her not."
11,10,4,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and the house that he had built,"
11,10,5,"And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the"
11,10,6,"And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom."
11,10,7,"Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen  it : and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard."
11,10,8,"Happy  are  thy men, happy  are  these thy servants, which stand continually before thee,  and  that hear thy wisdom."
11,10,9,"Blessed be the"
11,10,10,"And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon."
11,10,11,"And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones."
11,10,12,"And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the"
11,10,13,"And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside  that  which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants."
11,10,14,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,"
11,10,15,"Beside  that he had  of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country."
11,10,16,"And king Solomon made two hundred targets  of  beaten gold: six hundred  shekels  of gold went to one target."
11,10,17,"And  he made  three hundred shields  of  beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon."
11,10,18,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold."
11,10,19,"The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne  was  round behind: and  there were  stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays."
11,10,20,"And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom."
11,10,21,"And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels  were of  gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon  were of  pure gold; none  were of  silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon."
11,10,22,"For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."
11,10,23,"So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom."
11,10,24,"And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart."
11,10,25,"And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year."
11,10,26,"And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem."
11,10,27,"And the king made silver  to be  in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he  to be  as the sycomore trees that  are  in the vale, for abundance."
11,10,28,"And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price."
11,10,29,"And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred  shekels  of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring  them  out by their means."
11,11,1,"But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians,  and  Hittites;"
11,11,2,"Of the nations  concerning  which the"
11,11,3,"And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart."
11,11,4,"For it came to pass, when Solomon was old,  that  his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the"
11,11,5,"For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites."
11,11,6,"And Solomon did evil in the sight of the"
11,11,7,"Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that  is  before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon."
11,11,8,"And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods."
11,11,9,"And the"
11,11,10,"And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the"
11,11,11,"Wherefore the"
11,11,12,"Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father’s sake:  but  I will rend it out of the hand of thy son."
11,11,13,"Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom;  but  will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen."
11,11,14,"And the"
11,11,15,"For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;"
11,11,16,"(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)"
11,11,17,"That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad  being  yet a little child."
11,11,18,"And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land."
11,11,19,"And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen."
11,11,20,"And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh."
11,11,21,"And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country."
11,11,22,"Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise."
11,11,23,"And God stirred him up  another  adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:"
11,11,24,"And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them  of Zobah : and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus."
11,11,25,"And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad  did : and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria."
11,11,26,"And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name  was  Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up  his  hand against the king."
11,11,27,"And this  was  the cause that he lifted up  his  hand against the king: Solomon built Millo,  and  repaired the breaches of the city of David his father."
11,11,28,"And the man Jeroboam  was  a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph."
11,11,29,"And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two  were  alone in the field:"
11,11,30,"And Ahijah caught the new garment that  was  on him, and rent it  in  twelve pieces:"
11,11,31,"And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the"
11,11,32,"(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)"
11,11,33,"Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do  that which is  right in mine eyes, and  to keep  my statutes and my judgments, as  did  David his father."
11,11,34,"Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:"
11,11,35,"But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto thee,  even  ten tribes."
11,11,36,"And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there."
11,11,37,"And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel."
11,11,38,"And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do  that is  right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee."
11,11,39,"And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever."
11,11,40,"Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon."
11,11,41,"And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom,  are  they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?"
11,11,42,"And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel  was  forty years."
11,11,43,"And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead."
11,12,1,"And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king."
11,12,2,"And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard  of it , (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)"
11,12,3,"That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,"
11,12,4,"Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee."
11,12,5,"And he said unto them, Depart yet  for  three days, then come again to me. And the people departed."
11,12,6,"And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?"
11,12,7,"And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever."
11,12,8,"But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him,  and  which stood before him:"
11,12,9,"And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?"
11,12,10,"And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou  it  lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little  finger  shall be thicker than my father’s loins."
11,12,11,"And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."
11,12,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day."
11,12,13,"And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel that they gave him;"
11,12,14,"And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father  also  chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."
11,12,15,"Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the"
11,12,16,"So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither  have we  inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents."
11,12,17,"But  as for  the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them."
11,12,18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who  was  over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem."
11,12,19,"So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day."
11,12,20,"And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only."
11,12,21,"And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon."
11,12,22,"But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
11,12,23,"Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,"
11,12,24,"Thus saith the"
11,12,25,"Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel."
11,12,26,"And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:"
11,12,27,"If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the"
11,12,28,"Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves  of  gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt."
11,12,29,"And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan."
11,12,30,"And this thing became a sin: for the people went  to worship  before the one,  even  unto Dan."
11,12,31,"And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi."
11,12,32,"And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that  is  in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made."
11,12,33,"So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month,  even  in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense."
11,13,1,"And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the"
11,13,2,"And he cried against the altar in the word of the"
11,13,3,"And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This  is  the sign which the"
11,13,4,"And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him."
11,13,5,"The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the"
11,13,6,"And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the"
11,13,7,"And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward."
11,13,8,"And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:"
11,13,9,"For so was it charged me by the word of the"
11,13,10,"So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel."
11,13,11,"Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father."
11,13,12,"And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah."
11,13,13,"And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,"
11,13,14,"And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him,  Art  thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I  am ."
11,13,15,"Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread."
11,13,16,"And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:"
11,13,17,"For it was said to me by the word of the"
11,13,18,"He said unto him, I  am  a prophet also as thou  art ; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the"
11,13,19,"So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water."
11,13,20,"And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the"
11,13,21,"And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the"
11,13,22,"But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which  the"
11,13,23,"And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass,  to wit , for the prophet whom he had brought back."
11,13,24,"And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase."
11,13,25,"And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told  it  in the city where the old prophet dwelt."
11,13,26,"And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard  thereof , he said, It  is  the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the"
11,13,27,"And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled  him ."
11,13,28,"And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass."
11,13,29,"And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him."
11,13,30,"And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him,  saying , Alas, my brother!"
11,13,31,"And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God  is  buried; lay my bones beside his bones:"
11,13,32,"For the saying which he cried by the word of the"
11,13,33,"After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became  one  of the priests of the high places."
11,13,34,"And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut  it  off, and to destroy  it  from off the face of the earth."
11,14,1,"At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick."
11,14,2,"And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there  is  Ahijah the prophet, which told me that  I should be  king over this people."
11,14,3,"And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child."
11,14,4,"And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age."
11,14,5,"And the"
11,14,6,"And it was  so , when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself  to be  another? for I  am  sent to thee  with  heavy  tidings ."
11,14,7,"Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the"
11,14,8,"And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and  yet  thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do  that  only  which was  right in mine eyes;"
11,14,9,"But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:"
11,14,10,"Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall,  and  him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone."
11,14,11,"Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the"
11,14,12,"Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house:  and  when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die."
11,14,13,"And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found  some  good thing toward the"

11,14,15,"For the"
11,14,16,"And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin."
11,14,17,"And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:  and  when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;"
11,14,18,"And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the"
11,14,19,"And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they  are  written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
11,14,20,"And the days which Jeroboam reigned  were  two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead."
11,14,21,"And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam  was  forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the"
11,14,22,"And Judah did evil in the sight of the"

11,14,26,"And he took away the treasures of the house of the"
11,14,27,"And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed  them  unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king’s house."
11,14,28,"And it was  so , when the king went into the house of the"
11,14,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did,  are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
11,14,30,"And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all  their  days."
11,14,31,"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s name  was  Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead."
11,15,1,"Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah."
11,15,2,"Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom."
11,15,3,"And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the"
11,15,4,"Nevertheless for David’s sake did the"
11,15,5,"Because David did  that which was  right in the eyes of the"

11,15,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did,  are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam."
11,15,8,"And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead."
11,15,9,"And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah."
11,15,10,"And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom."
11,15,11,"And Asa did  that which was  right in the eyes of the"
11,15,12,"And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made."
11,15,13,"And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from  being  queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt  it  by the brook Kidron."
11,15,14,"But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart was perfect with the"
11,15,15,"And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the"
11,15,16,"And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days."
11,15,17,"And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."
11,15,18,"Then Asa took all the silver and the gold  that were  left in the treasures of the house of the"
11,15,19,"There is  a league between me and thee,  and  between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me."
11,15,20,"So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali."
11,15,21,"And it came to pass, when Baasha heard  thereof , that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah."
11,15,22,"Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none  was  exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah."
11,15,23,"The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built,  are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet."
11,15,24,"And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead."
11,15,25,"And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years."
11,15,26,"And he did evil in the sight of the"
11,15,27,"And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which  belonged  to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon."
11,15,28,"Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead."
11,15,29,"And it came to pass, when he reigned,  that  he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the"

11,16,6,"So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead."
11,16,7,"And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the"
11,16,8,"In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years."
11,16,9,"And his servant Zimri, captain of half  his  chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of  his  house in Tirzah."
11,16,10,"And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead."
11,16,11,"And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne,  that  he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends."
11,16,12,"Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the"
11,16,13,"For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the"

11,16,15,"In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people  were  encamped against Gibbethon, which  belonged  to the Philistines."
11,16,16,"And the people  that were  encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp."
11,16,17,"And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah."
11,16,18,"And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,"
11,16,19,"For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the"
11,16,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought,  are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,16,21,"Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri."
11,16,22,"But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned."
11,16,23,"In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah."
11,16,24,"And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria."
11,16,25,"But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the"

11,16,28,"So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead."
11,16,29,"And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years."
11,16,30,"And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the"

11,16,32,"And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria."
11,16,33,"And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the"

11,17,11,"And as she was going to fetch  it , he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand."
11,17,12,"And she said,  As  the"

11,17,16,"And  the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the"
11,17,17,"And it came to pass after these things,  that  the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him."
11,17,18,"And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?"
11,17,19,"And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed."
11,17,20,"And he cried unto the"

11,18,6,"So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself."
11,18,7,"And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said,  Art  thou that my lord Elijah?"
11,18,8,"And he answered him, I  am : go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah  is here ."
11,18,9,"And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?"
11,18,10,"As  the"
11,18,11,"And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah  is here ."
11,18,12,"And it shall come to pass,  as soon as  I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the"
11,18,13,"Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the"
11,18,14,"And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah  is here : and he shall slay me."
11,18,15,"And Elijah said,  As  the"
11,18,16,"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah."
11,18,17,"And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him,  Art  thou he that troubleth Israel?"
11,18,18,"And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the"
11,18,19,"Now therefore send,  and  gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table."
11,18,20,"So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel."
11,18,21,"And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the"
11,18,22,"Then said Elijah unto the people, I,  even  I only, remain a prophet of the"
11,18,23,"Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay  it  on wood, and put no fire  under : and I will dress the other bullock, and lay  it  on wood, and put no fire  under :"
11,18,24,"And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the"
11,18,25,"And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress  it  first; for ye  are  many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire  under ."
11,18,26,"And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed  it , and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But  there was  no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made."
11,18,27,"And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he  is  a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey,  or  peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked."
11,18,28,"And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them."
11,18,29,"And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the  time  of the offering of the  evening  sacrifice, that  there was  neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded."
11,18,30,"And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the"
11,18,31,"And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the"
11,18,32,"And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the"
11,18,33,"And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid  him  on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour  it  on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood."
11,18,34,"And he said, Do  it  the second time. And they did  it  the second time. And he said, Do  it  the third time. And they did  it  the third time."
11,18,35,"And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water."
11,18,36,"And it came to pass at  the time of  the offering of the  evening  sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said,"
11,18,37,"Hear me, O"
11,18,38,"Then the fire of the"
11,18,39,"And when all the people saw  it , they fell on their faces: and they said, The"
11,18,40,"And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there."
11,18,41,"And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for  there is  a sound of abundance of rain."
11,18,42,"So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,"
11,18,43,"And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said,  There is  nothing. And he said, Go again seven times."
11,18,44,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare  thy chariot , and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not."
11,18,45,"And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel."
11,18,46,"And the hand of the"
11,19,1,"And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword."
11,19,2,"Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do  to me , and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time."
11,19,3,"And when he saw  that , he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which  belongeth  to Judah, and left his servant there."
11,19,4,"But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O"
11,19,5,"And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise  and  eat."
11,19,6,"And he looked, and, behold,  there was  a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again."
11,19,7,"And the angel of the"
11,19,8,"And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God."
11,19,9,"And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the"
11,19,10,"And he said, I have been very jealous for the"
11,19,11,"And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the"
11,19,12,"And after the earthquake a fire;  but  the"
11,19,13,"And it was  so , when Elijah heard  it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold,  there came  a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?"
11,19,14,"And he said, I have been very jealous for the"
11,19,15,"And the"
11,19,16,"And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint  to be  king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint  to be  prophet in thy room."
11,19,17,"And it shall come to pass,  that  him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay."
11,19,18,"Yet I have left  me  seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him."
11,19,19,"So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who  was  plowing  with  twelve yoke  of oxen  before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him."
11,19,20,"And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and  then  I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?"
11,19,21,"And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him."
11,20,1,"And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and  there were  thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it."
11,20,2,"And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,"
11,20,3,"Thy silver and thy gold  is  mine; thy wives also and thy children,  even  the goodliest,  are  mine."
11,20,4,"And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I  am  thine, and all that I have."
11,20,5,"And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;"
11,20,6,"Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be,  that  whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put  it  in their hand, and take  it  away."
11,20,7,"Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this  man  seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not."
11,20,8,"And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not  unto him , nor consent."
11,20,9,"Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again."
11,20,10,"And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me."
11,20,11,"And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell  him , Let not him that girdeth on  his harness  boast himself as he that putteth it off."
11,20,12,"And it came to pass, when  Benhadad  heard this message, as he  was  drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set  yourselves in array . And they set  themselves in array  against the city."
11,20,13,"And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the"
11,20,14,"And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the"
11,20,15,"Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people,  even  all the children of Israel,  being  seven thousand."
11,20,16,"And they went out at noon. But Benhadad  was  drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him."
11,20,17,"And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria."
11,20,18,"And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive."
11,20,19,"So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them."
11,20,20,"And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen."
11,20,21,"And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter."
11,20,22,"And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee."
11,20,23,"And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods  are  gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they."
11,20,24,"And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:"
11,20,25,"And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain,  and  surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so."
11,20,26,"And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel."
11,20,27,"And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country."
11,20,28,"And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the"
11,20,29,"And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And  so  it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day."
11,20,30,"But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and  there  a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men  that were  left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber."
11,20,31,"And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel  are  merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life."
11,20,32,"So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and  put  ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said,  Is  he yet alive? he  is  my brother."
11,20,33,"Now the men did diligently observe whether  any thing would come  from him, and did hastily catch  it : and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot."
11,20,34,"And  Benhadad  said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then  said Ahab , I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away."
11,20,35,"And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the"
11,20,36,"Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the"
11,20,37,"Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded  him ."
11,20,38,"So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face."
11,20,39,"And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver."
11,20,40,"And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So  shall  thy judgment  be ; thyself hast decided  it ."
11,20,41,"And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he  was  of the prophets."
11,20,42,"And he said unto him, Thus saith the"
11,20,43,"And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria."
11,21,1,"And it came to pass after these things,  that  Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which  was  in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria."
11,21,2,"And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it  is  near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it;  or , if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money."
11,21,3,"And Naboth said to Ahab, The"
11,21,4,"And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread."
11,21,5,"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?"
11,21,6,"And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee  another  vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard."
11,21,7,"And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise,  and  eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
11,21,8,"So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed  them  with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that  were  in his city, dwelling with Naboth."
11,21,9,"And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:"
11,21,10,"And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And  then  carry him out, and stone him, that he may die."
11,21,11,"And the men of his city,  even  the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them,  and  as it  was  written in the letters which she had sent unto them."
11,21,12,"They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people."
11,21,13,"And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him,  even  against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died."
11,21,14,"Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead."
11,21,15,"And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead."
11,21,16,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it."
11,21,17,"And the word of the"
11,21,18,"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which  is  in Samaria: behold,  he is  in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it."
11,21,19,"And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the"
11,21,20,"And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found  thee : because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the"
11,21,21,"Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,"
11,21,22,"And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked  me  to anger, and made Israel to sin."
11,21,23,"And of Jezebel also spake the"
11,21,24,"Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat."
11,21,25,"But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the"
11,21,26,"And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all  things  as did the Amorites, whom the"
11,21,27,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly."
11,21,28,"And the word of the"
11,21,29,"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days:  but  in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house."
11,22,1,"And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel."
11,22,2,"And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel."
11,22,3,"And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead  is  ours, and we  be  still,  and  take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?"
11,22,4,"And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I  am  as thou  art , my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses."
11,22,5,"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the"
11,22,6,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver  it  into the hand of the king."
11,22,7,"And Jehoshaphat said,  Is there  not here a prophet of the"
11,22,8,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat,  There is  yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the"
11,22,9,"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten  hither  Micaiah the son of Imlah."
11,22,10,"And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them."
11,22,11,"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the"
11,22,12,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the"
11,22,13,"And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets  declare  good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak  that which is  good."
11,22,14,"And Micaiah said,  As  the"
11,22,15,"So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the"
11,22,16,"And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but  that which is  true in the name of the"
11,22,17,"And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the"
11,22,18,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?"
11,22,19,"And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the"
11,22,20,"And the"
11,22,21,"And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the"
11,22,22,"And the"
11,22,23,"Now therefore, behold, the"
11,22,24,"But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the"
11,22,25,"And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself."
11,22,26,"And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;"
11,22,27,"And say, Thus saith the king, Put this  fellow  in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace."
11,22,28,"And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the"
11,22,29,"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead."
11,22,30,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle."
11,22,31,"But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel."
11,22,32,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it  is  the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out."
11,22,33,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it  was  not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him."
11,22,34,"And a  certain  man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded."
11,22,35,"And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot."
11,22,36,"And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country."
11,22,37,"So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria."
11,22,38,"And  one  washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the"
11,22,39,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built,  are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,22,40,"So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead."
11,22,41,"And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel."
11,22,42,"Jehoshaphat  was  thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Azubah the daughter of Shilhi."
11,22,43,"And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing  that which was  right in the eyes of the"
11,22,44,"And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel."
11,22,45,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred,  are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
11,22,46,"And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land."
11,22,47,"There was  then no king in Edom: a deputy  was  king."
11,22,48,"Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber."
11,22,49,"Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not."
11,22,50,"And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead."
11,22,51,"Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel."
11,22,52,"And he did evil in the sight of the"
11,22,53,"For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the"
12,1,1,"Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab."
12,1,2,"And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that  was  in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease."
12,1,3,"But the angel of the"
12,1,4,"Now therefore thus saith the"
12,1,5,"And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?"
12,1,6,"And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the"
12,1,7,"And he said unto them, What manner of man  was he  which came up to meet you, and told you these words?"
12,1,8,"And they answered him,  He was  an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It  is  Elijah the Tishbite."
12,1,9,"Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down."
12,1,10,"And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I  be  a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."
12,1,11,"Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly."
12,1,12,"And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I  be  a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."
12,1,13,"And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight."
12,1,14,"Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight."
12,1,15,"And the angel of the"
12,1,16,"And he said unto him, Thus saith the"
12,1,17,"So he died according to the word of the"
12,1,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did,  are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,2,1,"And it came to pass, when the"
12,2,2,"And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the"
12,2,3,"And the sons of the prophets that  were  at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the"
12,2,4,"And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the"
12,2,5,"And the sons of the prophets that  were  at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the"
12,2,6,"And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the"
12,2,7,"And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan."
12,2,8,"And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped  it  together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground."
12,2,9,"And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me."
12,2,10,"And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing:  nevertheless , if thou see me  when I am  taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be  so ."
12,2,11,"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold,  there appeared  a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."
12,2,12,"And Elisha saw  it , and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces."
12,2,13,"He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;"
12,2,14,"And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where  is  the"
12,2,15,"And when the sons of the prophets which  were  to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him."
12,2,16,"And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the"
12,2,17,"And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not."
12,2,18,"And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?"
12,2,19,"And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city  is  pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water  is  naught, and the ground barren."
12,2,20,"And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought  it  to him."
12,2,21,"And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the"
12,2,22,"So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake."
12,2,23,"And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head."
12,2,24,"And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the"
12,2,25,"And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria."
12,3,1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years."
12,3,2,"And he wrought evil in the sight of the"
12,3,3,"Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom."
12,3,4,"And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool."
12,3,5,"But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel."
12,3,6,"And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel."
12,3,7,"And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I  am  as thou  art , my people as thy people,  and  my horses as thy horses."
12,3,8,"And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom."
12,3,9,"So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them."
12,3,10,"And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the"
12,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said,  Is there  not here a prophet of the"
12,3,12,"And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the"
12,3,13,"And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the"
12,3,14,"And Elisha said,  As  the"
12,3,15,"But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the"
12,3,16,"And he said, Thus saith the"
12,3,17,"For thus saith the"
12,3,18,"And this is  but  a light thing in the sight of the"
12,3,19,"And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones."
12,3,20,"And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water."
12,3,21,"And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border."
12,3,22,"And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side  as  red as blood:"
12,3,23,"And they said, This  is  blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil."
12,3,24,"And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in  their  country."
12,3,25,"And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about  it , and smote it."
12,3,26,"And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through  even  unto the king of Edom: but they could not."
12,3,27,"Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him  for  a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to  their own  land."
12,4,1,"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the"
12,4,2,"And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil."
12,4,3,"Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours,  even  empty vessels; borrow not a few."
12,4,4,"And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full."
12,4,5,"So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought  the vessels  to her; and she poured out."
12,4,6,"And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her,  There is  not a vessel more. And the oil stayed."
12,4,7,"Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest."
12,4,8,"And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where  was  a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And  so  it was,  that  as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread."
12,4,9,"And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this  is  an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually."
12,4,10,"Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither."
12,4,11,"And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there."
12,4,12,"And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him."
12,4,13,"And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what  is  to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people."
12,4,14,"And he said, What then  is  to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old."
12,4,15,"And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door."
12,4,16,"And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord,  thou  man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid."
12,4,17,"And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life."
12,4,18,"And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers."
12,4,19,"And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother."
12,4,20,"And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and  then  died."
12,4,21,"And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut  the door  upon him, and went out."
12,4,22,"And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again."
12,4,23,"And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day?  it is  neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said,  It shall be  well."
12,4,24,"Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not  thy  riding for me, except I bid thee."
12,4,25,"So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold,  yonder is  that Shunammite:"
12,4,26,"Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her,  Is it  well with thee?  is it  well with thy husband?  is it  well with the child? And she answered,  It is  well."
12,4,27,"And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul  is  vexed within her: and the"
12,4,28,"Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?"
12,4,29,"Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child."
12,4,30,"And the mother of the child said,  As  the"
12,4,31,"And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but  there was  neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked."
12,4,32,"And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead,  and  laid upon his bed."
12,4,33,"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the"
12,4,34,"And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm."
12,4,35,"Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes."
12,4,36,"And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son."
12,4,37,"Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out."
12,4,38,"And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and  there was  a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets  were  sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets."
12,4,39,"And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred  them  into the pot of pottage: for they knew  them  not."
12,4,40,"So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O  thou  man of God,  there is  death in the pot. And they could not eat  thereof ."
12,4,41,"But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast  it  into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot."
12,4,42,"And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat."
12,4,43,"And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the"
12,4,44,"So he set  it  before them, and they did eat, and left  thereof , according to the word of the"
12,5,1,"Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the"
12,5,2,"And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman’s wife."
12,5,3,"And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord  were  with the prophet that  is  in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy."
12,5,4,"And  one  went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that  is  of the land of Israel."
12,5,5,"And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand  pieces  of gold, and ten changes of raiment."
12,5,6,"And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have  therewith  sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy."
12,5,7,"And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said,  Am  I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me."
12,5,8,"And it was  so , when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel."
12,5,9,"So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha."
12,5,10,"And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean."
12,5,11,"But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the"
12,5,12,"Are  not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage."
12,5,13,"And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father,  if  the prophet had bid thee  do some  great thing, wouldest thou not have done  it ? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?"
12,5,14,"Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean."
12,5,15,"And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that  there is  no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant."
12,5,16,"But he said,  As  the"
12,5,17,"And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules’ burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the"
12,5,18,"In this thing the"
12,5,19,"And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way."
12,5,20,"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but,  as  the"
12,5,21,"So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw  him  running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said,  Is  all well?"
12,5,22,"And he said, All  is  well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments."
12,5,23,"And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid  them  upon two of his servants; and they bare  them  before him."
12,5,24,"And when he came to the tower, he took  them  from their hand, and bestowed  them  in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed."
12,5,25,"But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence  comest thou , Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither."
12,5,26,"And he said unto him, Went not mine heart  with thee , when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee?  Is it  a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?"
12,5,27,"The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper  as white  as snow."
12,6,1,"And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us."
12,6,2,"Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye."
12,6,3,"And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go."
12,6,4,"So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood."
12,6,5,"But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed."
12,6,6,"And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast  it  in thither; and the iron did swim."
12,6,7,"Therefore said he, Take  it  up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it."
12,6,8,"Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place  shall be  my camp."
12,6,9,"And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down."
12,6,10,"And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice."
12,6,11,"Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us  is  for the king of Israel?"
12,6,12,"And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that  is  in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber."
12,6,13,"And he said, Go and spy where he  is , that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold,  he is  in Dothan."
12,6,14,"Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about."
12,6,15,"And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?"
12,6,16,"And he answered, Fear not: for they that  be  with us  are  more than they that  be  with them."
12,6,17,"And Elisha prayed, and said,"
12,6,18,"And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the"
12,6,19,"And Elisha said unto them, This  is  not the way, neither  is  this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria."
12,6,20,"And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said,"
12,6,21,"And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite  them ? shall I smite  them ?"
12,6,22,"And he answered, Thou shalt not smite  them : wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master."
12,6,23,"And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel."
12,6,24,"And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria."
12,6,25,"And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass’s head was  sold  for fourscore  pieces  of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung for five  pieces  of silver."
12,6,26,"And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king."
12,6,27,"And he said, If the"
12,6,28,"And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow."
12,6,29,"So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son."
12,6,30,"And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold,  he had  sackcloth within upon his flesh."
12,6,31,"Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day."
12,6,32,"But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and  the king  sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door:  is  not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?"
12,6,33,"And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil  is  of the"
12,7,1,"Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the"
12,7,2,"Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold,  if  the"
12,7,3,"And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?"
12,7,4,"If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine  is  in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die."
12,7,5,"And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold,  there was  no man there."
12,7,6,"For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses,  even  the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us."
12,7,7,"Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it  was , and fled for their life."
12,7,8,"And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid  it ; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence  also , and went and hid  it ."
12,7,9,"Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day  is  a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king’s household."
12,7,10,"So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold,  there was  no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they  were ."
12,7,11,"And he called the porters; and they told  it  to the king’s house within."
12,7,12,"And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we  be  hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city."
12,7,13,"And one of his servants answered and said, Let  some  take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they  are  as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold,  I say , they  are  even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see."
12,7,14,"They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see."
12,7,15,"And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way  was  full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king."
12,7,16,"And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was  sold  for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the"
12,7,17,"And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him."
12,7,18,"And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:"
12,7,19,"And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold,  if  the"
12,7,20,"And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died."
12,8,1,"Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the"
12,8,2,"And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years."
12,8,3,"And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land."
12,8,4,"And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done."
12,8,5,"And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this  is  the woman, and this  is  her son, whom Elisha restored to life."
12,8,6,"And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that  was  hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now."
12,8,7,"And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither."
12,8,8,"And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the"
12,8,9,"So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?"
12,8,10,"And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the"
12,8,11,"And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept."
12,8,12,"And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child."
12,8,13,"And Hazael said, But what,  is  thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The"
12,8,14,"So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me  that  thou shouldest surely recover."
12,8,15,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped  it  in water, and spread  it  on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead."
12,8,16,"And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat  being  then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign."
12,8,17,"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem."
12,8,18,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the"
12,8,19,"Yet the"
12,8,20,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves."
12,8,21,"So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents."
12,8,22,"Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time."
12,8,23,"And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did,  are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,8,24,"And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead."
12,8,25,"In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign."
12,8,26,"Two and twenty years old  was  Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel."
12,8,27,"And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the"
12,8,28,"And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram."
12,8,29,"And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick."
12,9,1,"And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:"
12,9,2,"And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;"
12,9,3,"Then take the box of oil, and pour  it  on his head, and say, Thus saith the"
12,9,4,"So the young man,  even  the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead."
12,9,5,"And when he came, behold, the captains of the host  were  sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain."
12,9,6,"And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the"
12,9,7,"And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the"
12,9,8,"For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:"
12,9,9,"And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:"
12,9,10,"And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and  there shall be  none to bury  her . And he opened the door, and fled."
12,9,11,"Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and  one  said unto him,  Is  all well? wherefore came this mad  fellow  to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication."
12,9,12,"And they said,  It is  false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the"
12,9,13,"Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put  it  under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king."
12,9,14,"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria."
12,9,15,"But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds,  then  let none go forth  nor  escape out of the city to go to tell  it  in Jezreel."
12,9,16,"So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram."
12,9,17,"And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say,  Is it  peace?"
12,9,18,"So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king,  Is it  peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again."
12,9,19,"Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king,  Is it  peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me."
12,9,20,"And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving  is  like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously."
12,9,21,"And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite."
12,9,22,"And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said,  Is it  peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts  are so  many?"
12,9,23,"And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah,  There is  treachery, O Ahaziah."
12,9,24,"And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot."
12,9,25,"Then said  Jehu  to Bidkar his captain, Take up,  and  cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the"
12,9,26,"Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the"
12,9,27,"But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw  this , he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot.  And they did so  at the going up to Gur, which  is  by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there."
12,9,28,"And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David."
12,9,29,"And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah."
12,9,30,"And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard  of it ; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window."
12,9,31,"And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said,  Had  Zimri peace, who slew his master?"
12,9,32,"And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who  is  on my side? who? And there looked out to him two  or  three eunuchs."
12,9,33,"And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and  some  of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot."
12,9,34,"And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed  woman , and bury her: for she  is  a king’s daughter."
12,9,35,"And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of  her  hands."
12,9,36,"Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This  is  the word of the"
12,9,37,"And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel;  so  that they shall not say, This  is  Jezebel."
12,10,1,"And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab’s  children , saying,"
12,10,2,"Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons  are  with you, and  there are  with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;"
12,10,3,"Look even out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set  him  on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house."
12,10,4,"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?"
12,10,5,"And he that  was  over the house, and he that  was  over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up  of the children , sent to Jehu, saying, We  are  thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou  that which is  good in thine eyes."
12,10,6,"Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye  be  mine, and  if  ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king’s sons,  being  seventy persons,  were  with the great men of the city, which brought them up."
12,10,7,"And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him  them  to Jezreel."
12,10,8,"And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning."
12,10,9,"And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye  be  righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?"
12,10,10,"Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the"
12,10,11,"So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining."
12,10,12,"And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria.  And  as he  was  at the shearing house in the way,"
12,10,13,"Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who  are  ye? And they answered, We  are  the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen."
12,10,14,"And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house,  even  two and forty men; neither left he any of them."
12,10,15,"And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab  coming  to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart  is  with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give  me  thine hand. And he gave  him  his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot."
12,10,16,"And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the"
12,10,17,"And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the"
12,10,18,"And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little;  but  Jehu shall serve him much."
12,10,19,"Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice  to do  to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did  it  in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal."
12,10,20,"And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed  it ."
12,10,21,"And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another."
12,10,22,"And he said unto him that  was  over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments."
12,10,23,"And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the"
12,10,24,"And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said,  If  any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape,  he that letteth him go , his life  shall be  for the life of him."
12,10,25,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in,  and  slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast  them  out, and went to the city of the house of Baal."
12,10,26,"And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them."
12,10,27,"And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day."
12,10,28,"Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel."
12,10,29,"Howbeit  from  the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them,  to wit , the golden calves that  were  in Bethel, and that  were  in Dan."
12,10,30,"And the"
12,10,31,"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the"
12,10,32,"In those days the"
12,10,33,"From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which  is  by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan."
12,10,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might,  are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,10,35,"And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead."
12,10,36,"And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria  was  twenty and eight years."
12,11,1,"And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal."
12,11,2,"But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons  which were  slain; and they hid him,  even  him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain."
12,11,3,"And he was with her hid in the house of the"
12,11,4,"And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the"
12,11,5,"And he commanded them, saying, This  is  the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;"
12,11,6,"And a third part  shall be  at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down."
12,11,7,"And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the"
12,11,8,"And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in."
12,11,9,"And the captains over the hundreds did according to all  things  that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest."
12,11,10,"And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David’s spears and shields, that  were  in the temple of the"
12,11,11,"And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple,  along  by the altar and the temple."
12,11,12,"And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and  gave him  the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king."
12,11,13,"And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard  and  of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the"
12,11,14,"And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner  was , and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason."
12,11,15,"But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the"
12,11,16,"And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king’s house: and there was she slain."
12,11,17,"And Jehoiada made a covenant between the"
12,11,18,"And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the"
12,11,19,"And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the"
12,11,20,"And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword  beside  the king’s house."
12,11,21,"Seven years old  was  Jehoash when he began to reign."
12,12,1,"In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Zibiah of Beersheba."
12,12,2,"And Jehoash did  that which was  right in the sight of the"
12,12,3,"But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places."
12,12,4,"And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the"
12,12,5,"Let the priests take  it  to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found."
12,12,6,"But it was  so, that  in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house."
12,12,7,"Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the  other  priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no  more  money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house."
12,12,8,"And the priests consented to receive no  more  money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house."
12,12,9,"But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the"
12,12,10,"And it was  so , when they saw that  there was  much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the"
12,12,11,"And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the"

12,18,32,"Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The"

12,19,1,"And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard  it , that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the"

12,19,8,"So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish."
12,19,9,"And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,"
12,19,10,"Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria."
12,19,11,"Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?"
12,19,12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed;  as  Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which  were  in Thelasar?"

12,19,14,"And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the"

12,19,17,"Of a truth,"
12,19,18,"And have cast their gods into the fire: for they  were  no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them."
12,19,19,"Now therefore, O"
12,19,20,"Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the"

12,19,23,"By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof,  and  the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders,  and into  the forest of his Carmel."
12,19,24,"I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places."
12,19,25,"Hast thou not heard long ago  how  I have done it,  and  of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities  into  ruinous heaps."
12,19,26,"Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were  as  the grass of the field, and  as  the green herb,  as  the grass on the housetops, and  as corn  blasted before it be grown up."
12,19,27,"But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me."
12,19,28,"Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest."
12,19,29,"And this  shall be  a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof."
12,19,30,"And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward."

12,19,37,"And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead."
12,20,1,"In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the"

12,20,7,"And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid  it  on the boil, and he recovered."
12,20,8,"And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What  shall be  the sign that the"
12,20,9,"And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the"

12,20,11,"And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the"
12,20,12,"At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick."
12,20,13,"And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and  all  the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not."
12,20,14,"Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country,  even  from Babylon."
12,20,15,"And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All  the things  that  are  in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them."
12,20,16,"And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the"
12,20,17,"Behold, the days come, that all that  is  in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the"
12,20,18,"And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
12,20,19,"Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good  is  the word of the"
12,20,20,"And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city,  are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,20,21,"And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead."
12,21,1,"Manasseh  was  twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Hephzibah."
12,21,2,"And he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the"
12,21,3,"For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them."
12,21,4,"And he built altars in the house of the"
12,21,5,"And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the"

12,21,12,"Therefore thus saith the"
12,21,13,"And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as  a man  wipeth a dish, wiping  it , and turning  it  upside down."
12,21,14,"And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;"
12,21,15,"Because they have done  that which was  evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day."
12,21,16,"Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing  that which was  evil in the sight of the"

12,21,19,"Amon  was  twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah."
12,21,20,"And he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the"

12,21,24,"And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead."
12,21,25,"Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did,  are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,21,26,"And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead."
12,22,1,"Josiah  was  eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath."
12,22,2,"And he did  that which was  right in the sight of the"

12,23,6,"And he brought out the grove from the house of the"

12,23,8,"And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that  were  in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which  were  on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city."
12,23,9,"Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the"

12,23,14,"And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men."
12,23,15,"Moreover the altar that  was  at Bethel,  and  the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place,  and  stamped  it  small to powder, and burned the grove."
12,23,16,"And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that  were  there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned  them  upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the"

12,23,30,"And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father’s stead."
12,23,31,"Jehoahaz  was  twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."

12,23,34,"And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there."
12,23,35,"And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give  it  unto Pharaohnechoh."
12,23,36,"Jehoiakim  was  twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah."
12,23,37,"And he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the"

12,24,15,"And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land,  those  carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon."
12,24,16,"And all the men of might,  even  seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all  that were  strong  and  apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon."
12,24,17,"And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father’s brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah."

12,25,2,"And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah."
12,25,3,"And on the ninth  day  of the  fourth  month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land."

12,25,5,"And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him."
12,25,6,"So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him."
12,25,7,"And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon."
12,25,8,"And in the fifth month, on the seventh  day  of the month, which  is  the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:"
12,25,9,"And he burnt the house of the"

13,9,38,"And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren."
13,9,39,"And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal."
13,9,40,"And the son of Jonathan  was  Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat Micah."
13,9,41,"And the sons of Micah  were , Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea,  and Ahaz ."

13,10,1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa."
13,10,2,"And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul."
13,10,3,"And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers."
13,10,4,"Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it."
13,10,5,"And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died."
13,10,6,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together."
13,10,7,"And when all the men of Israel that  were  in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them."
13,10,8,"And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa."
13,10,9,"And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people."
13,10,10,"And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon."
13,10,11,"And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,"
13,10,12,"They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days."
13,10,13,"So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the"

13,11,5,"And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which  is  the city of David."
13,11,6,"And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief."
13,11,7,"And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David."
13,11,8,"And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city."
13,11,9,"So David waxed greater and greater: for the"

13,11,13,"He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines."
13,11,14,"And they set themselves in the midst of  that  parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the"
13,11,15,"Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim."
13,11,16,"And David  was  then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison  was  then at Bethlehem."
13,11,17,"And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that  is  at the gate!"
13,11,18,"And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that  was  by the gate, and took  it , and brought  it  to David: but David would not drink  of  it, but poured it out to the"

13,11,20,"And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew  them , and had a name among the three."
13,11,21,"Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the  first  three."
13,11,22,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day."
13,11,23,"And he slew an Egyptian, a man of  great  stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand  was  a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear."
13,11,24,"These  things  did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties."

13,12,40,"Moreover they that were nigh them,  even  unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen,  and  meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for  there was  joy in Israel."
13,13,1,"And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds,  and  with every leader."
13,13,2,"And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If  it seem  good unto you, and  that it be  of the"

13,13,4,"And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people."
13,13,5,"So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim."
13,13,6,"And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah,  that is , to Kirjathjearim, which  belonged  to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the"
13,13,7,"And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart."
13,13,8,"And David and all Israel played before God with all  their  might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets."
13,13,9,"And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled."

13,13,13,"So David brought not the ark  home  to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite."
13,13,14,"And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the"

13,14,8,"And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard  of it , and went out against them."
13,14,9,"And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim."
13,14,10,"And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the"
13,14,11,"So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim."
13,14,12,"And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire."
13,14,13,"And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley."
13,14,14,"Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees."
13,14,15,"And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees,  that  then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines."
13,14,16,"David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer."
13,14,17,"And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the"

13,15,12,"And said unto them, Ye  are  the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves,  both  ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the"

13,15,17,"So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;"
13,15,18,"And with them their brethren of the second  degree , Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters."
13,15,19,"So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan,  were appointed  to sound with cymbals of brass;"

13,15,22,"And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites,  was  for song: he instructed about the song, because he  was  skilful."
13,15,23,"And Berechiah and Elkanah  were  doorkeepers for the ark."
13,15,24,"And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah  were  doorkeepers for the ark."

13,17,1,"Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the"
13,17,2,"Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that  is  in thine heart; for God  is  with thee."
13,17,3,"And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,"
13,17,4,"Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the"
13,17,5,"For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from  one  tabernacle  to another ."
13,17,6,"Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?"
13,17,7,"Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the"
13,17,8,"And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that  are  in the earth."
13,17,9,"Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,"
13,17,10,"And since the time that I commanded judges  to be  over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the"
13,17,11,"And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go  to be  with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom."
13,17,12,"He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever."
13,17,13,"I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took  it  from  him  that was before thee:"
13,17,14,"But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore."
13,17,15,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David."
13,17,16,"And David the king came and sat before the"
13,17,17,"And  yet  this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast  also  spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O"
13,17,18,"What can David  speak  more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant."
13,17,19,"O"
13,17,20,"O"
13,17,21,"And what one nation in the earth  is  like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem  to be  his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?"
13,17,22,"For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou,"
13,17,23,"Therefore now,"
13,17,24,"Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The"

13,18,1,"Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines."
13,18,2,"And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants,  and  brought gifts."
13,18,3,"And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates."
13,18,4,"And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot  horses , but reserved of them an hundred chariots."
13,18,5,"And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men."
13,18,6,"Then David put  garrisons  in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David’s servants,  and  brought gifts. Thus the"
13,18,7,"And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
13,18,8,"Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass."
13,18,9,"Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;"
13,18,10,"He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and  with him  all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass."
13,18,11,"Them also king David dedicated unto the"
13,18,12,"Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand."
13,18,13,"And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David’s servants. Thus the"
13,18,14,"So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people."
13,18,15,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah  was  over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder."
13,18,16,"And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,  were  the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;"
13,18,17,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada  was  over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David  were  chief about the king."
13,19,1,"Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead."
13,19,2,"And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him."
13,19,3,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?"
13,19,4,"Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away."
13,19,5,"Then there went  certain , and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and  then  return."
13,19,6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah."
13,19,7,"So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle."
13,19,8,"And when David heard  of it , he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men."
13,19,9,"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come  were  by themselves in the field."
13,19,10,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put  them  in array against the Syrians."
13,19,11,"And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set  themselves  in array against the children of Ammon."
13,19,12,"And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee."
13,19,13,"Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the"
13,19,14,"So Joab and the people that  were  with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him."
13,19,15,"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem."
13,19,16,"And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that  were  beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer  went  before them."
13,19,17,"And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set  the battle  in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him."
13,19,18,"But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand  men which fought in  chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host."
13,19,19,"And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more."
13,20,1,"And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out  to battle , Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it."
13,20,2,"And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and  there were  precious stones in it; and it was set upon David’s head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city."
13,20,3,"And he brought out the people that  were  in it, and cut  them  with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."
13,20,4,"And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai,  that was  of the children of the giant: and they were subdued."
13,20,5,"And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff  was  like a weaver’s beam."
13,20,6,"And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of  great  stature, whose fingers and toes  were  four and twenty, six  on each hand , and six  on each foot : and he also was the son of the giant."
13,20,7,"But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him."
13,20,8,"These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants."
13,21,1,"And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel."
13,21,2,"And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know  it ."
13,21,3,"And Joab answered, The"
13,21,4,"Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem."
13,21,5,"And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all  they of  Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah  was  four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword."
13,21,6,"But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s word was abominable to Joab."
13,21,7,"And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel."
13,21,8,"And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly."
13,21,9,"And the"
13,21,10,"Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the"
13,21,11,"So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the"

13,21,14,"So the"
13,21,15,"And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the"

13,21,20,"And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat."
13,21,21,"And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with  his  face to the ground."
13,21,22,"Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of  this  threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the"
13,21,23,"And Ornan said unto David, Take  it  to thee, and let my lord the king do  that which is  good in his eyes: lo, I give  thee  the oxen  also  for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all."
13,21,24,"And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take  that  which  is  thine for the"
13,21,25,"So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight."
13,21,26,"And David built there an altar unto the"

13,22,3,"And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;"
13,22,4,"Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David."
13,22,5,"And David said, Solomon my son  is  young and tender, and the house  that is  to be builded for the"

13,22,10,"He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I  will be  his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever."

13,22,16,"Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron,  there is  no number. Arise  therefore , and be doing, and the"

13,23,2,"And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites."
13,23,3,"Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand."
13,23,4,"Of which, twenty and four thousand  were  to set forward the work of the house of the"

13,23,7,"Of the Gershonites  were , Laadan, and Shimei."
13,23,8,"The sons of Laadan; the chief  was  Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three."
13,23,9,"The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These  were  the chief of the fathers of Laadan."
13,23,10,"And the sons of Shimei  were , Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four  were  the sons of Shimei."
13,23,11,"And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to  their  father’s house."
13,23,12,"The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four."
13,23,13,"The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the"

13,23,15,"The sons of Moses  were , Gershom, and Eliezer."
13,23,16,"Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel  was  the chief."
13,23,17,"And the sons of Eliezer  were , Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many."
13,23,18,"Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief."
13,23,19,"Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth."
13,23,20,"Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah the first, and Jesiah the second."
13,23,21,"The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish."
13,23,22,"And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them."
13,23,23,"The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three."
13,23,24,"These  were  the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;  even  the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the"

13,23,26,"And also unto the Levites; they shall no  more  carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof."
13,23,27,"For by the last words of David the Levites  were  numbered from twenty years old and above:"
13,23,28,"Because their office  was  to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the"

13,24,3,"And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service."
13,24,4,"And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and  thus  were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar  there were  sixteen chief men of the house of  their  fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers."
13,24,5,"Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors  of the house  of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar."
13,24,6,"And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe,  one  of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and  before  the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and  one  taken for Ithamar."
13,24,7,"Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,"

13,24,28,"Of Mahli  came  Eleazar, who had no sons."
13,24,29,"Concerning Kish: the son of Kish  was  Jerahmeel."
13,24,30,"The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These  were  the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers."
13,24,31,"These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren."
13,25,1,"Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:"

14,1,9,"Now, O"
14,1,10,"Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people,  that is so  great?"
14,1,11,"And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:"
14,1,12,"Wisdom and knowledge  is  granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that  have been  before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like."
14,1,13,"Then Solomon came  from his journey  to the high place that  was  at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel."
14,1,14,"And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
14,1,15,"And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem  as plenteous  as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that  are  in the vale for abundance."
14,1,16,"And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price."
14,1,17,"And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred  shekels  of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out  horses  for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means."
14,2,1,"And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the"

14,2,3,"And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein,  even so deal with me ."
14,2,4,"Behold, I build an house to the name of the"

14,2,6,"But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who  am  I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?"
14,2,7,"Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that  are  with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide."
14,2,8,"Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants  shall be  with thy servants,"
14,2,9,"Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build  shall be  wonderful great."
14,2,10,"And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil."
14,2,11,"Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the"
14,2,12,"Huram said moreover, Blessed  be  the"

14,2,14,"The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father  was  a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father."
14,2,15,"Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:"
14,2,16,"And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem."
14,2,17,"And Solomon numbered all the strangers that  were  in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred."
14,2,18,"And he set threescore and ten thousand of them  to be  bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand  to be  hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work."
14,3,1,"Then Solomon began to build the house of the"
14,3,2,"And he began to build in the second  day  of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign."
14,3,3,"Now these  are the things wherein  Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure  was  threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits."
14,3,4,"And the porch that  was  in the front  of the house , the length  of it was  according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height  was  an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold."
14,3,5,"And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains."
14,3,6,"And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold  was  gold of Parvaim."
14,3,7,"He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls."
14,3,8,"And he made the most holy house, the length whereof  was  according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold,  amounting  to six hundred talents."
14,3,9,"And the weight of the nails  was  fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold."
14,3,10,"And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold."
14,3,11,"And the wings of the cherubims  were  twenty cubits long: one wing  of the one cherub was  five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing  was likewise  five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub."
14,3,12,"And  one  wing of the other cherub  was  five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing  was  five cubits  also , joining to the wing of the other cherub."
14,3,13,"The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces  were  inward."
14,3,14,"And he made the vail  of  blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon."
14,3,15,"Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that  was  on the top of each of them  was  five cubits."
14,3,16,"And he made chains,  as  in the oracle, and put  them  on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put  them  on the chains."
14,3,17,"And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz."
14,4,1,"Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof."
14,4,2,"Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about."
14,4,3,"And under it  was  the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen  were  cast, when it was cast."
14,4,4,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea  was set  above upon them, and all their hinder parts  were  inward."
14,4,5,"And the thickness of it  was  an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies;  and  it received and held three thousand baths."
14,4,6,"He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea  was  for the priests to wash in."
14,4,7,"And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set  them  in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left."
14,4,8,"He made also ten tables, and placed  them  in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold."
14,4,9,"Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass."
14,4,10,"And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south."
14,4,11,"And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;"
14,4,12,"To wit , the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters  which were  on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which  were  on the top of the pillars;"
14,4,13,"And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which  were  upon the pillars."
14,4,14,"He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;"
14,4,15,"One sea, and twelve oxen under it."
14,4,16,"The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the"
14,4,17,"In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah."
14,4,18,"Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out."
14,4,19,"And Solomon made all the vessels that  were for  the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread  was set ;"
14,4,20,"Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;"
14,4,21,"And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs,  made he of  gold,  and  that perfect gold;"
14,4,22,"And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers,  of  pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy  place , and the doors of the house of the temple,  were of  gold."
14,5,1,"Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the"
14,5,2,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the"
14,5,3,"Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which  was  in the seventh month."
14,5,4,"And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark."
14,5,5,"And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that  were  in the tabernacle, these did the priests  and  the Levites bring up."
14,5,6,"Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude."
14,5,7,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the"
14,5,8,"For the cherubims spread forth  their  wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above."
14,5,9,"And they drew out the staves  of the ark , that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day."
14,5,10,"There was  nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put  therein  at Horeb, when the"
14,5,11,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy  place : (for all the priests  that were  present were sanctified,  and  did not  then  wait by course:"
14,5,12,"Also the Levites  which were  the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren,  being  arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)"
14,5,13,"It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers  were  as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the"
14,5,14,"So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the"
14,6,1,"Then said Solomon, The"
14,6,2,"But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever."
14,6,3,"And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood."
14,6,4,"And he said, Blessed  be  the"
14,6,5,"Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:"
14,6,6,"But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel."
14,6,7,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the"
14,6,8,"But the"
14,6,9,"Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name."
14,6,10,"The"
14,6,11,"And in it have I put the ark, wherein  is  the covenant of the"
14,6,12,"And he stood before the altar of the"
14,6,13,"For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven,"
14,6,14,"And said, O"
14,6,15,"Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled  it  with thine hand, as  it is  this day."
14,6,16,"Now therefore, O"
14,6,17,"Now then, O"
14,6,18,"But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!"
14,6,19,"Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O"
14,6,20,"That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place."
14,6,21,"Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place,  even  from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive."
14,6,22,"If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;"
14,6,23,"Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness."
14,6,24,"And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;"
14,6,25,"Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers."
14,6,26,"When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee;  yet  if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;"
14,6,27,"Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance."
14,6,28,"If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness  there be :"
14,6,29,"Then  what prayer  or  what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:"
14,6,30,"Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)"
14,6,31,"That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers."
14,6,32,"Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name’s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;"
14,6,33,"Then hear thou from the heavens,  even  from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as  doth  thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name."
14,6,34,"If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;"
14,6,35,"Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
14,6,36,"If they sin against thee, (for  there is  no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before  their  enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;"
14,6,37,"Yet  if  they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;"
14,6,38,"If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and  toward  the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:"
14,6,39,"Then hear thou from the heavens,  even  from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee."
14,6,40,"Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and  let  thine ears  be  attent unto the prayer  that is made  in this place."
14,6,41,"Now therefore arise, O"
14,6,42,"O"
14,7,1,"Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the"
14,7,2,"And the priests could not enter into the house of the"
14,7,3,"And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the"
14,7,4,"Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the"
14,7,5,"And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God."
14,7,6,"And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the"
14,7,7,"Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that  was  before the house of the"
14,7,8,"Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt."
14,7,9,"And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days."
14,7,10,"And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the"
14,7,11,"Thus Solomon finished the house of the"
14,7,12,"And the"
14,7,13,"If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;"
14,7,14,"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."
14,7,15,"Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer  that is made  in this place."
14,7,16,"For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually."
14,7,17,"And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;"
14,7,18,"Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man  to be  ruler in Israel."
14,7,19,"But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;"
14,7,20,"Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it  to be  a proverb and a byword among all nations."
14,7,21,"And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the"
14,7,22,"And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the"
14,8,1,"And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the"
14,8,2,"That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there."
14,8,3,"And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it."
14,8,4,"And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath."
14,8,5,"Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;"
14,8,6,"And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion."
14,8,7,"As for  all the people  that were  left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which  were  not of Israel,"
14,8,8,"But  of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day."
14,8,9,"But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they  were  men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen."
14,8,10,"And these  were  the chief of king Solomon’s officers,  even  two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people."
14,8,11,"And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because  the places are  holy, whereunto the ark of the"
14,8,12,"Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the"
14,8,13,"Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year,  even  in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles."
14,8,14,"And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded."
14,8,15,"And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures."
14,8,16,"Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the"
14,8,17,"Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom."
14,8,18,"And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought  them  to king Solomon."
14,9,1,"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart."
14,9,2,"And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not."
14,9,3,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,"
14,9,4,"And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the"
14,9,5,"And she said to the king,  It was  a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:"
14,9,6,"Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen  it : and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me:  for  thou exceedest the fame that I heard."
14,9,7,"Happy  are  thy men, and happy  are  these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom."
14,9,8,"Blessed be the"
14,9,9,"And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon."
14,9,10,"And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones."
14,9,11,"And the king made  of  the algum trees terraces to the house of the"
14,9,12,"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside  that  which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants."
14,9,13,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;"
14,9,14,"Beside  that which  chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon."
14,9,15,"And king Solomon made two hundred targets  of  beaten gold: six hundred  shekels  of beaten gold went to one target."
14,9,16,"And three hundred shields  made he of  beaten gold: three hundred  shekels  of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon."
14,9,17,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold."
14,9,18,"And  there were  six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,  which were  fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:"
14,9,19,"And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom."
14,9,20,"And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon  were of  gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon  were of  pure gold: none  were of  silver; it was  not  any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon."
14,9,21,"For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."
14,9,22,"And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom."
14,9,23,"And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart."
14,9,24,"And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year."
14,9,25,"And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
14,9,26,"And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt."
14,9,27,"And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that  are  in the low plains in abundance."
14,9,28,"And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands."
14,9,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last,  are  they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?"
14,9,30,"And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years."
14,9,31,"And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead."
14,10,1,"And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king."
14,10,2,"And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who  was  in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard  it , that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt."
14,10,3,"And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,"
14,10,4,"Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee."
14,10,5,"And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed."
14,10,6,"And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye  me  to return answer to this people?"
14,10,7,"And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever."
14,10,8,"But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him."
14,10,9,"And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?"
14,10,10,"And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou  it  somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little  finger  shall be thicker than my father’s loins."
14,10,11,"For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I  will chastise you  with scorpions."
14,10,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day."
14,10,13,"And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,"
14,10,14,"And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I  will chastise you  with scorpions."
14,10,15,"So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the"
14,10,16,"And when all Israel  saw  that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and  we have  none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel:  and  now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents."
14,10,17,"But  as for  the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them."
14,10,18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that  was  over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to  his  chariot, to flee to Jerusalem."
14,10,19,"And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day."
14,11,1,"And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen  men , which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam."
14,11,2,"But the word of the"
14,11,3,"Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,"
14,11,4,"Thus saith the"
14,11,5,"And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah."
14,11,6,"He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,"
14,11,7,"And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,"
14,11,8,"And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,"
14,11,9,"And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,"
14,11,10,"And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which  are  in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities."
14,11,11,"And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine."
14,11,12,"And in every several city  he put  shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side."
14,11,13,"And the priests and the Levites that  were  in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts."
14,11,14,"For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest’s office unto the"
14,11,15,"And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made."
14,11,16,"And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the"
14,11,17,"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon."
14,11,18,"And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife,  and  Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;"
14,11,19,"Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham."
14,11,20,"And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith."
14,11,21,"And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)"
14,11,22,"And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief,  to be  ruler among his brethren: for  he thought  to make him king."
14,11,23,"And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives."
14,12,1,"And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the"
14,12,2,"And it came to pass,  that  in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the"
14,12,3,"With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people  were  without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians."
14,12,4,"And he took the fenced cities which  pertained  to Judah, and came to Jerusalem."
14,12,5,"Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and  to  the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the"
14,12,6,"Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The"
14,12,7,"And when the"
14,12,8,"Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."
14,12,9,"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the"
14,12,10,"Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed  them  to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king’s house."

14,12,15,"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last,  are  they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And  there were  wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually."
14,12,16,"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead."
14,13,1,"Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah."
14,13,2,"He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also  was  Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam."
14,13,3,"And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war,  even  four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men,  being  mighty men of valour."
14,13,4,"And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which  is  in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;"
14,13,5,"Ought ye not to know that the"
14,13,6,"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord."
14,13,7,"And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them."
14,13,8,"And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the"
14,13,9,"Have ye not cast out the priests of the"
14,13,10,"But as for us, the"
14,13,11,"And they burn unto the"
14,13,12,"And, behold, God himself  is  with us for  our  captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the"
14,13,13,"But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment  was  behind them."
14,13,14,"And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle  was  before and behind: and they cried unto the"
14,13,15,"Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah."
14,13,16,"And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand."
14,13,17,"And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men."
14,13,18,"Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the"
14,13,19,"And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof."
14,13,20,"Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the"
14,13,21,"But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters."
14,13,22,"And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings,  are  written in the story of the prophet Iddo."
14,14,1,"So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years."
14,14,2,"And Asa did  that which was  good and right in the eyes of the"
14,14,3,"For he took away the altars of the strange  gods , and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:"
14,14,4,"And commanded Judah to seek the"
14,14,5,"Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him."
14,14,6,"And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the"
14,14,7,"Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about  them  walls, and towers, gates, and bars,  while  the land  is  yet before us; because we have sought the"
14,14,8,"And Asa had an army  of men  that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these  were  mighty men of valour."
14,14,9,"And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah."
14,14,10,"Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah."
14,14,11,"And Asa cried unto the"
14,14,12,"So the"
14,14,13,"And Asa and the people that  were  with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the"
14,14,14,"And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the"
14,14,15,"They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem."
14,15,1,"And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:"
14,15,2,"And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The"
14,15,3,"Now for a long season Israel  hath been  without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law."
14,15,4,"But when they in their trouble did turn unto the"
14,15,5,"And in those times  there was  no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations  were  upon all the inhabitants of the countries."
14,15,6,"And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity."
14,15,7,"Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded."
14,15,8,"And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the"
14,15,9,"And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the"
14,15,10,"So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa."
14,15,11,"And they offered unto the"
14,15,12,"And they entered into a covenant to seek the"
14,15,13,"That whosoever would not seek the"
14,15,14,"And they sware unto the"
14,15,15,"And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the"
14,15,16,"And also  concerning  Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from  being  queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped  it , and burnt  it  at the brook Kidron."
14,15,17,"But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days."
14,15,18,"And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels."
14,15,19,"And there was no  more  war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa."
14,16,1,"In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."
14,16,2,"Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the"
14,16,3,"There is  a league between me and thee, as  there was  between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me."
14,16,4,"And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali."
14,16,5,"And it came to pass, when Baasha heard  it , that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease."
14,16,6,"Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah."
14,16,7,"And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the"
14,16,8,"Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the"
14,16,9,"For the eyes of the"
14,16,10,"Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for  he was  in a rage with him because of this  thing . And Asa oppressed  some  of the people the same time."
14,16,11,"And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they  are  written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14,16,12,"And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease  was  exceeding  great : yet in his disease he sought not to the"
14,16,13,"And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign."
14,16,14,"And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds  of spices  prepared by the apothecaries’ art: and they made a very great burning for him."
14,17,1,"And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel."
14,17,2,"And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken."
14,17,3,"And the"
14,17,4,"But sought to the"
14,17,5,"Therefore the"
14,17,6,"And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the"

14,17,8,"And with them  he sent  Levites,  even  Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests."
14,17,9,"And they taught in Judah, and  had  the book of the law of the"
14,17,10,"And the fear of the"
14,17,11,"Also  some  of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats."
14,17,12,"And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store."
14,17,13,"And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour,  were  in Jerusalem."
14,17,14,"And these  are  the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand."
14,17,15,"And next to him  was  Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand."
14,17,16,"And next him  was  Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the"
14,17,17,"And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand."
14,17,18,"And next him  was  Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war."
14,17,19,"These waited on the king, beside  those  whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah."
14,18,1,"Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab."
14,18,2,"And after  certain  years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that  he had  with him, and persuaded him to go up  with him  to Ramothgilead."
14,18,3,"And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I  am  as thou  art , and my people as thy people; and  we will be  with thee in the war."
14,18,4,"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the"
14,18,5,"Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver  it  into the king’s hand."
14,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat said,  Is there  not here a prophet of the"
14,18,7,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat,  There is  yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the"
14,18,8,"And the king of Israel called for one  of his  officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla."
14,18,9,"And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in  their  robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them."
14,18,10,"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the"
14,18,11,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the"
14,18,12,"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets  declare  good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good."
14,18,13,"And Micaiah said,  As  the"
14,18,14,"And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand."
14,18,15,"And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the"
14,18,16,"Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the"
14,18,17,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee  that  he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?"
14,18,18,"Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the"
14,18,19,"And the"
14,18,20,"Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the"

14,18,22,"Now therefore, behold, the"
14,18,23,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the"
14,18,24,"And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself."
14,18,25,"Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;"
14,18,26,"And say, Thus saith the king, Put this  fellow  in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace."
14,18,27,"And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace,  then  hath not the"
14,18,28,"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead."
14,18,29,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle."
14,18,30,"Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that  were  with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel."
14,18,31,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It  is  the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the"
14,18,32,"For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him."
14,18,33,"And a  certain  man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded."
14,18,34,"And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed  himself  up in  his  chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died."
14,19,1,"And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem."
14,19,2,"And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the"
14,19,3,"Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God."
14,19,4,"And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the"
14,19,5,"And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,"
14,19,6,"And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the"
14,19,7,"Wherefore now let the fear of the"

14,20,1,"It came to pass after this also,  that  the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them  other  beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle."
14,20,2,"Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they  be  in Hazazontamar, which  is  Engedi."
14,20,3,"And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the"
14,20,4,"And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask  help  of the"
14,20,5,"And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the"
14,20,6,"And said, O"
14,20,7,"Art  not thou our God,  who  didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?"
14,20,8,"And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,"
14,20,9,"If,  when  evil cometh upon us,  as  the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name  is  in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help."
14,20,10,"And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;"
14,20,11,"Behold,  I say, how  they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit."
14,20,12,"O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes  are  upon thee."
14,20,13,"And all Judah stood before the"
14,20,14,"Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the"
14,20,15,"And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the"
14,20,16,"To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel."
14,20,17,"Ye shall not  need  to fight in this  battle : set yourselves, stand ye  still , and see the salvation of the"
14,20,18,"And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with  his  face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the"
14,20,19,"And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the"
14,20,20,"And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the"
14,20,21,"And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the"
14,20,22,"And when they began to sing and to praise, the"
14,20,23,"For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy  them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another."
14,20,24,"And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they  were  dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped."
14,20,25,"And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much."
14,20,26,"And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the"
14,20,27,"Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the"

14,20,29,"And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of  those  countries, when they had heard that the"
14,20,30,"So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about."
14,20,31,"And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah:  he was  thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Azubah the daughter of Shilhi."
14,20,32,"And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing  that which was  right in the sight of the"
14,20,33,"Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers."
14,20,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they  are  written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who  is  mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel."
14,20,35,"And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:"
14,20,36,"And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongeber."
14,20,37,"Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the"
14,21,1,"Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead."
14,21,2,"And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these  were  the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel."
14,21,3,"And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he  was  the firstborn."
14,21,4,"Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and  divers  also of the princes of Israel."
14,21,5,"Jehoram  was  thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem."
14,21,6,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought  that which was  evil in the eyes of the"

14,21,8,"In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king."
14,21,9,"Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots."
14,21,10,"So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time  also  did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the"

14,21,12,"And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the"
14,21,13,"But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father’s house,  which were  better than thyself:"
14,21,14,"Behold, with a great plague will the"

14,21,16,"Moreover the"

14,21,18,"And after all this the"
14,21,19,"And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers."
14,21,20,"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings."
14,22,1,"And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned."
14,22,2,"Forty and two years old  was  Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also  was  Athaliah the daughter of Omri."
14,22,3,"He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counseller to do wickedly."
14,22,4,"Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the"
14,22,5,"He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram."
14,22,6,"And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick."
14,22,7,"And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the"
14,22,8,"And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them."
14,22,9,"And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he  is  the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the"
14,22,10,"But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah."
14,22,11,"But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not."
14,22,12,"And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land."
14,23,1,"And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him."
14,23,2,"And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem."
14,23,3,"And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the"
14,23,4,"This  is  the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites,  shall be  porters of the doors;"
14,23,5,"And a third part  shall be  at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people  shall be  in the courts of the house of the"
14,23,6,"But let none come into the house of the"
14,23,7,"And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever  else  cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out."
14,23,8,"So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go  out  on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses."
14,23,9,"Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that  had been  king David’s, which  were  in the house of God."
14,23,10,"And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about."
14,23,11,"Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the crown, and  gave him  the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king."
14,23,12,"Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the"
14,23,13,"And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason."
14,23,14,"Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the"
14,23,15,"So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king’s house, they slew her there."
14,23,16,"And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the"
14,23,17,"Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars."
14,23,18,"Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the"
14,23,19,"And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the"
14,23,20,"And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the"
14,23,21,"And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword."
14,24,1,"Joash  was  seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also  was  Zibiah of Beersheba."
14,24,2,"And Joash did  that which was  right in the sight of the"
14,24,3,"And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters."
14,24,4,"And it came to pass after this,  that  Joash was minded to repair the house of the"
14,24,5,"And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened  it  not."
14,24,6,"And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection,  according to the commandment  of Moses the servant of the"
14,24,7,"For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the"
14,24,8,"And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the"
14,24,9,"And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the"
14,24,10,"And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end."
14,24,11,"Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that  there was  much money, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance."
14,24,12,"And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the"
14,24,13,"So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it."
14,24,14,"And when they had finished  it , they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the"
14,24,15,"But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old  was he  when he died."
14,24,16,"And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house."
14,24,17,"Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them."
14,24,18,"And they left the house of the"
14,24,19,"Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the"
14,24,20,"And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the"

14,24,22,"Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The"
14,24,23,"And it came to pass at the end of the year,  that  the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus."
14,24,24,"For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the"
14,24,25,"And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings."
14,24,26,"And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess."
14,24,27,"Now  concerning  his sons, and the greatness of the burdens  laid  upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they  are  written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead."
14,25,1,"Amaziah  was  twenty and five years old  when  he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Jehoaddan of Jerusalem."
14,25,2,"And he did  that which was  right in the sight of the"
14,25,3,"Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father."
14,25,4,"But he slew not their children, but  did  as  it is  written in the law in the book of Moses, where the"
14,25,5,"Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of  their  fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice  men, able  to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield."
14,25,6,"He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver."
14,25,7,"But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the"
14,25,8,"But if thou wilt go, do  it , be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down."
14,25,9,"And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The"
14,25,10,"Then Amaziah separated them,  to wit , the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger."
14,25,11,"And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand."
14,25,12,"And  other  ten thousand  left  alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces."
14,25,13,"But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil."
14,25,14,"Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up  to be  his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them."
14,25,15,"Wherefore the anger of the"
14,25,16,"And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that  the king  said unto him, Art thou made of the king’s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel."
14,25,17,"Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face."
14,25,18,"And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that  was  in Lebanon sent to the cedar that  was  in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that  was  in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle."
14,25,19,"Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to  thine  hurt, that thou shouldest fall,  even  thou, and Judah with thee?"
14,25,20,"But Amaziah would not hear; for it  came  of God, that he might deliver them into the hand  of their enemies , because they sought after the gods of Edom."
14,25,21,"So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face,  both  he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which  belongeth  to Judah."
14,25,22,"And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent."
14,25,23,"And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits."
14,25,24,"And  he took  all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria."
14,25,25,"And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years."
14,25,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,  are  they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?"
14,25,27,"Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the"
14,25,28,"And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah."
14,26,1,"Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who  was  sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah."
14,26,2,"He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers."
14,26,3,"Sixteen years old  was  Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also  was  Jecoliah of Jerusalem."
14,26,4,"And he did  that which was  right in the sight of the"
14,26,5,"And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the"
14,26,6,"And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines."
14,26,7,"And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims."
14,26,8,"And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad  even  to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened  himself  exceedingly."
14,26,9,"Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning  of the wall , and fortified them."
14,26,10,"Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen  also , and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry."
14,26,11,"Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah,  one  of the king’s captains."
14,26,12,"The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour  were  two thousand and six hundred."
14,26,13,"And under their hand  was  an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy."
14,26,14,"And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings  to cast  stones."
14,26,15,"And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong."
14,26,16,"But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to  his  destruction: for he transgressed against the"
14,26,17,"And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the"
14,26,18,"And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him,  It appertaineth  not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the"
14,26,19,"Then Uzziah was wroth, and  had  a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the"
14,26,20,"And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he  was  leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the"
14,26,21,"And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house,  being  a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the"
14,26,22,"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write."
14,26,23,"So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which  belonged  to the kings; for they said, He  is  a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead."
14,27,1,"Jotham  was  twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also  was  Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok."
14,27,2,"And he did  that which was  right in the sight of the"
14,27,3,"He built the high gate of the house of the"
14,27,4,"Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers."
14,27,5,"He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third."
14,27,6,"So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the"
14,27,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they  are  written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
14,27,8,"He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem."
14,27,9,"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead."
14,28,1,"Ahaz  was  twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not  that which was  right in the sight of the"
14,28,2,"For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim."
14,28,3,"Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the"
14,28,4,"He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree."
14,28,5,"Wherefore the"

14,28,8,"And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria."
14,28,9,"But a prophet of the"

14,28,12,"Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,"
14,28,13,"And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the"
14,28,14,"So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation."
14,28,15,"And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria."
14,28,16,"At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him."
14,28,17,"For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives."
14,28,18,"The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there."
14,28,19,"For the"

14,28,24,"And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the"
14,28,25,"And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the"

14,28,27,"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city,  even  in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead."
14,29,1,"Hezekiah began to reign  when he was  five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah."

14,29,20,"Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the"
14,29,21,"And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer  them  on the altar of the"
14,29,22,"So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled  it  on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar."
14,29,23,"And they brought forth the he goats  for  the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:"
14,29,24,"And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded  that  the burnt offering and the sin offering  should be made  for all Israel."
14,29,25,"And he set the Levites in the house of the"
14,29,26,"And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets."
14,29,27,"And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the"
14,29,28,"And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded:  and  all  this continued  until the burnt offering was finished."
14,29,29,"And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped."
14,29,30,"Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the"
14,29,31,"Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the"
14,29,32,"And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams,  and  two hundred lambs: all these  were  for a burnt offering to the"
14,29,33,"And the consecrated things  were  six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep."
14,29,34,"But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the  other  priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites  were  more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests."
14,29,35,"And also the burnt offerings  were  in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for  every  burnt offering. So the service of the house of the"
14,29,36,"And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was  done  suddenly."
14,30,1,"And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the"
14,30,2,"For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month."
14,30,3,"For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem."
14,30,4,"And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation."
14,30,5,"So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the"
14,30,6,"So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the"
14,30,7,"And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the"
14,30,8,"Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers  were, but  yield yourselves unto the"

14,30,10,"So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them."
14,30,11,"Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem."
14,30,12,"Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the"
14,30,13,"And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation."
14,30,14,"And they arose and took away the altars that  were  in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast  them  into the brook Kidron."
14,30,15,"Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth  day  of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the"
14,30,16,"And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood,  which they received  of the hand of the Levites."
14,30,17,"For  there were  many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one  that was  not clean, to sanctify  them  unto the"
14,30,18,"For a multitude of the people,  even  many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good"
14,30,19,"That  prepareth his heart to seek God, the"
14,30,20,"And the"
14,30,21,"And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the"
14,30,22,"And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the"
14,30,23,"And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept  other  seven days with gladness."
14,30,24,"For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves."
14,30,25,"And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced."
14,30,26,"So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel  there was  not the like in Jerusalem."
14,30,27,"Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came  up  to his holy dwelling place,  even  unto heaven."
14,31,1,"Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities."
14,31,2,"And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the"
14,31,3,"He appointed  also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings,  to wit , for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as  it is  written in the law of the"
14,31,4,"Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the"
14,31,5,"And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all  things  brought they in abundantly."
14,31,6,"And  concerning  the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the"
14,31,7,"In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished  them  in the seventh month."
14,31,8,"And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the"
14,31,9,"Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps."
14,31,10,"And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since  the people  began to bring the offerings into the house of the"
14,31,11,"Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the"
14,31,12,"And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated  things  faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite  was  ruler, and Shimei his brother  was  the next."
14,31,13,"And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah,  were  overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God."
14,31,14,"And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east,  was  over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the"
14,31,15,"And next him  were  Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in  their  set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:"
14,31,16,"Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward,  even  unto every one that entereth into the house of the"
14,31,17,"Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;"
14,31,18,"And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:"
14,31,19,"Also of the sons of Aaron the priests,  which were  in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites."
14,31,20,"And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought  that which was  good and right and truth before the"
14,31,21,"And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did  it  with all his heart, and prospered."
14,32,1,"After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself."
14,32,2,"And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,"
14,32,3,"He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which  were  without the city: and they did help him."
14,32,4,"So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?"
14,32,5,"Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised  it  up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo  in  the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance."
14,32,6,"And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,"
14,32,7,"Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that  is  with him: for  there be  more with us than with him:"
14,32,8,"With him  is  an arm of flesh; but with us  is  the"
14,32,9,"After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he  himself laid siege  against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that  were  at Jerusalem, saying,"
14,32,10,"Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?"
14,32,11,"Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The"
14,32,12,"Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?"
14,32,13,"Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of  other  lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?"
14,32,14,"Who  was there  among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?"
14,32,15,"Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?"
14,32,16,"And his servants spake yet  more  against the"
14,32,17,"He wrote also letters to rail on the"
14,32,18,"Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech unto the people of Jerusalem that  were  on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city."
14,32,19,"And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth,  which were  the work of the hands of man."
14,32,20,"And for this  cause  Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven."
14,32,21,"And the"
14,32,22,"Thus the"
14,32,23,"And many brought gifts unto the"
14,32,24,"In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the"
14,32,25,"But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit  done  unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem."
14,32,26,"Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart,  both  he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the"
14,32,27,"And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;"
14,32,28,"Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks."
14,32,29,"Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much."
14,32,30,"This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works."
14,32,31,"Howbeit in  the business of  the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was  done  in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all  that was  in his heart."
14,32,32,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they  are  written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz,  and  in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14,32,33,"And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead."
14,33,1,"Manasseh  was  twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:"
14,33,2,"But did  that which was  evil in the sight of the"
14,33,3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them."
14,33,4,"Also he built altars in the house of the"
14,33,5,"And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the"
14,33,6,"And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the"
14,33,7,"And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:"
14,33,8,"Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses."
14,33,9,"So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err,  and  to do worse than the heathen, whom the"
14,33,10,"And the"

14,33,12,"And when he was in affliction, he besought the"

14,33,14,"Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah."
14,33,15,"And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the"
14,33,16,"And he repaired the altar of the"
14,33,17,"Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places,  yet  unto the"
14,33,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the"
14,33,19,"His prayer also, and  how God  was intreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they  are  written among the sayings of the seers."
14,33,20,"So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead."
14,33,21,"Amon  was  two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem."
14,33,22,"But he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the"
14,33,23,"And humbled not himself before the"
14,33,24,"And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house."
14,33,25,"But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead."
14,34,1,"Josiah  was  eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years."
14,34,2,"And he did  that which was  right in the sight of the"
14,34,3,"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images."
14,34,4,"And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that  were  on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust  of them , and strowed  it  upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them."
14,34,5,"And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem."
14,34,6,"And  so did he  in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about."
14,34,7,"And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem."
14,34,8,"Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the"
14,34,9,"And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem."
14,34,10,"And they put  it  in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the"
14,34,11,"Even to the artificers and builders gave they  it , to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed."
14,34,12,"And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them  were  Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set  it  forward; and  other of  the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick."
14,34,13,"Also  they were  over the bearers of burdens, and  were  overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites  there were  scribes, and officers, and porters."
14,34,14,"And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the"
14,34,15,"And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the"
14,34,16,"And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do  it ."
14,34,17,"And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the"
14,34,18,"Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king."
14,34,19,"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes."
14,34,20,"And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king’s, saying,"
14,34,21,"Go, inquire of the"
14,34,22,"And Hilkiah, and  they  that the king  had appointed , went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that  effect ."
14,34,23,"And she answered them, Thus saith the"
14,34,24,"Thus saith the"
14,34,25,"Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched."
14,34,26,"And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the"
14,34,27,"Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard  thee  also, saith the"
14,34,28,"Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again."
14,34,29,"Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem."
14,34,30,"And the king went up into the house of the"
14,34,31,"And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the"
14,34,32,"And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand  to it . And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers."
14,34,33,"And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that  pertained  to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve,  even  to serve the"
14,35,1,"Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the"
14,35,2,"And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the"
14,35,3,"And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the"
14,35,4,"And prepare  yourselves  by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son."
14,35,5,"And stand in the holy  place  according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and  after  the division of the families of the Levites."
14,35,6,"So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that  they  may do according to the word of the"
14,35,7,"And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these  were  of the king’s substance."
14,35,8,"And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred  small cattle , and three hundred oxen."
14,35,9,"Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand  small cattle , and five hundred oxen."
14,35,10,"So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king’s commandment."
14,35,11,"And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled  the blood  from their hands, and the Levites flayed  them ."
14,35,12,"And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the"
14,35,13,"And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the  other  holy  offerings  sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided  them  speedily among all the people."
14,35,14,"And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron  were busied  in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron."
14,35,15,"And the singers the sons of Asaph  were  in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the porters  waited  at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them."
14,35,16,"So all the service of the"
14,35,17,"And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days."
14,35,18,"And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
14,35,19,"In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept."
14,35,20,"After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him."
14,35,21,"But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah?  I come  not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from  meddling with  God, who  is  with me, that he destroy thee not."
14,35,22,"Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo."
14,35,23,"And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded."
14,35,24,"His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in  one of  the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah."
14,35,25,"And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they  are  written in the lamentations."

14,36,1,"Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem."
14,36,2,"Jehoahaz  was  twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem."
14,36,3,"And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold."
14,36,4,"And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt."
14,36,5,"Jehoiakim  was  twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did  that which was  evil in the sight of the"

14,36,18,"And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the"

15,4,12,"Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls  thereof , and joined the foundations."
15,4,13,"Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up  again, then  will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and  so  thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings."
15,4,14,"Now because we have maintenance from  the king’s  palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king’s dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;"
15,4,15,"That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city  is  a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed."
15,4,16,"We certify the king that, if this city be builded  again , and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river."
15,4,17,"Then  sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and  to  Shimshai the scribe, and  to  the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and  unto  the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time."
15,4,18,"The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me."
15,4,19,"And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and  that  rebellion and sedition have been made therein."
15,4,20,"There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all  countries  beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them."
15,4,21,"Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until  another  commandment shall be given from me."
15,4,22,"Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?"
15,4,23,"Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter  was  read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power."
15,4,24,"Then ceased the work of the house of God which  is  at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia."
15,5,1,"Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that  were  in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel,  even  unto them."
15,5,2,"Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which  is  at Jerusalem: and with them  were  the prophets of God helping them."
15,5,3,"At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?"
15,5,4,"Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?"
15,5,5,"But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this  matter ."
15,5,6,"The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which  were  on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:"
15,5,7,"They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace."
15,5,8,"Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands."
15,5,9,"Then asked we those elders,  and  said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?"
15,5,10,"We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that  were  the chief of them."
15,5,11,"And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up."
15,5,12,"But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon."
15,5,13,"But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon  the same  king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God."
15,5,14,"And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that  was  in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto  one , whose name  was  Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;"
15,5,15,"And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that  is  in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place."
15,5,16,"Then came the same Sheshbazzar,  and  laid the foundation of the house of God which  is  in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and  yet  it is not finished."
15,5,17,"Now therefore, if  it seem  good to the king, let there be search made in the king’s treasure house, which  is  there at Babylon, whether it be  so , that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter."
15,6,1,"Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon."
15,6,2,"And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that  is  in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein  was  a record thus written:"
15,6,3,"In the first year of Cyrus the king  the same  Cyrus the king made a decree  concerning  the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits,  and  the breadth thereof threescore cubits;"
15,6,4,"With  three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expences be given out of the king’s house:"
15,6,5,"And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which  is  at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which  is  at Jerusalem,  every one  to his place, and place  them  in the house of God."
15,6,6,"Now  therefore , Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which  are  beyond the river, be ye far from thence:"
15,6,7,"Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place."
15,6,8,"Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods,  even  of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expences be given unto these men, that they be not hindered."
15,6,9,"And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which  are  at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:"
15,6,10,"That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons."
15,6,11,"Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this."
15,6,12,"And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter  and  to destroy this house of God which  is  at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed."
15,6,13,"Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily."
15,6,14,"And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished  it , according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."
15,6,15,"And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king."
15,6,16,"And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,"
15,6,17,"And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel."
15,6,18,"And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which  is  at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses."
15,6,19,"And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth  day  of the first month."
15,6,20,"For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them  were  pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves."
15,6,21,"And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the"
15,6,22,"And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the"

15,8,17,"And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo,  and  to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God."
15,8,18,"And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;"

15,8,20,"Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name."
15,8,21,"Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance."
15,8,22,"For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God  is  upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath  is  against all them that forsake him."
15,8,23,"So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us."

15,8,25,"And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels,  even  the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellers, and his lords, and all Israel  there  present, had offered:"
15,8,26,"I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents,  and  of gold an hundred talents;"
15,8,27,"Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold."
15,8,28,"And I said unto them, Ye  are  holy unto the"

15,8,31,"Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth  day  of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way."

15,8,33,"Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him  was  Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them  was  Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;"
15,8,34,"By number  and  by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time."
15,8,35,"Also  the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats  for  a sin offering: all  this was  a burnt offering unto the"
15,8,36,"And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God."
15,9,1,"Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands,  doing  according to their abominations,  even  of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites."
15,9,2,"For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of  those  lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass."
15,9,3,"And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied."
15,9,4,"Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice."
15,9,5,"And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the"
15,9,6,"And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over  our  head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens."
15,9,7,"Since the days of our fathers  have  we  been  in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings,  and  our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as  it is  this day."
15,9,8,"And now for a little space grace hath been  shewed  from the"
15,9,9,"For we  were  bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem."
15,9,10,"And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,"
15,9,11,"Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness."
15,9,12,"Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave  it  for an inheritance to your children for ever."
15,9,13,"And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities  deserve , and hast given us  such  deliverance as this;"
15,9,14,"Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed  us , so that  there should be  no remnant nor escaping?"
15,9,15,"O"
15,10,1,"Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore."
15,10,2,"And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel,  one  of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing."
15,10,3,"Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law."
15,10,4,"Arise; for  this  matter  belongeth  unto thee: we also  will be  with thee: be of good courage, and do  it ."
15,10,5,"Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware."
15,10,6,"Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and  when  he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away."
15,10,7,"And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;"
15,10,8,"And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away."
15,10,9,"Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It  was  the ninth month, on the twentieth  day  of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of  this  matter, and for the great rain."
15,10,10,"And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel."
15,10,11,"Now therefore make confession unto the"
15,10,12,"Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do."
15,10,13,"But the people  are  many, and  it is  a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither  is this  a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing."
15,10,14,"Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us."
15,10,15,"Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this  matter : and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them."
15,10,16,"And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest,  with  certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by  their  names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter."
15,10,17,"And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month."
15,10,18,"And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives:  namely , of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah."
15,10,19,"And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and  being  guilty,  they offered  a ram of the flock for their trespass."
15,10,20,"And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah."
15,10,21,"And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah."

16,1,1,"The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,"
16,1,2,"That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and  certain  men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem."
16,1,3,"And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province  are  in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also  is  broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire."
16,1,4,"And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned  certain  days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,"
16,1,5,"And said, I beseech thee, O"
16,1,6,"Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father’s house have sinned."
16,1,7,"We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses."
16,1,8,"Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying,  If  ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:"
16,1,9,"But  if  ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven,  yet  will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there."
16,1,10,"Now these  are  thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand."
16,1,11,"O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king’s cupbearer."
16,2,1,"And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king,  that  wine  was  before him: and I took up the wine, and gave  it  unto the king. Now I had not been  beforetime  sad in his presence."
16,2,2,"Wherefore the king said unto me, Why  is  thy countenance sad, seeing thou  art  not sick? this  is  nothing  else  but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,"
16,2,3,"And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres,  lieth  waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?"
16,2,4,"Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven."
16,2,5,"And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it."
16,2,6,"And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time."
16,2,7,"Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;"
16,2,8,"And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which  appertained  to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me."
16,2,9,"Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me."
16,2,10,"When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard  of it , it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel."
16,2,11,"So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days."
16,2,12,"And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I  any  man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither  was there any  beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon."
16,2,13,"And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire."
16,2,14,"Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s pool: but  there was  no place for the beast  that was  under me to pass."
16,2,15,"Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and  so  returned."
16,2,16,"And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told  it  to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work."
16,2,17,"Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we  are  in, how Jerusalem  lieth  waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach."
16,2,18,"Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for  this  good  work ."
16,2,19,"But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard  it , they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What  is  this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?"
16,2,20,"Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem."
16,3,1,"Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel."
16,3,2,"And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri."
16,3,3,"But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who  also  laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
16,3,4,"And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana."
16,3,5,"And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord."
16,3,6,"Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
16,3,7,"And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river."
16,3,8,"Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of  one of  the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall."
16,3,9,"And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem."
16,3,10,"And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah."
16,3,11,"Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces."
16,3,12,"And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters."
16,3,13,"The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate."
16,3,14,"But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
16,3,15,"But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king’s garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David."
16,3,16,"After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Bethzur, unto  the place  over against the sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty."
16,3,17,"After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his part."
16,3,18,"After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah."
16,3,19,"And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning  of the wall ."
16,3,20,"After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning  of the wall  unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest."
16,3,21,"After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib."
16,3,22,"And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain."
16,3,23,"After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house. After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by his house."
16,3,24,"After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah unto the turning  of the wall , even unto the corner."
16,3,25,"Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning  of the wall , and the tower which lieth out from the king’s high house, that  was  by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh."
16,3,26,"Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto  the place  over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out."
16,3,27,"After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel."
16,3,28,"From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house."
16,3,29,"After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate."
16,3,30,"After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber."
16,3,31,"After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith’s son unto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner."
16,3,32,"And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants."
16,4,1,"But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews."
16,4,2,"And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?"
16,4,3,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite  was  by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall."
16,4,4,"Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:"
16,4,5,"And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked  thee  to anger before the builders."
16,4,6,"So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work."
16,4,7,"But it came to pass,  that  when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up,  and  that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,"
16,4,8,"And conspired all of them together to come  and  to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it."
16,4,9,"Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them."
16,4,10,"And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and  there is  much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall."
16,4,11,"And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease."
16,4,12,"And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us  they will be upon you ."
16,4,13,"Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall,  and  on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows."
16,4,14,"And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord,  which is  great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses."
16,4,15,"And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work."
16,4,16,"And it came to pass from that time forth,  that  the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers  were  behind all the house of Judah."
16,4,17,"They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded,  every one  with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other  hand  held a weapon."
16,4,18,"For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and  so  builded. And he that sounded the trumpet  was  by me."
16,4,19,"And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work  is  great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another."
16,4,20,"In what place  therefore  ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us."
16,4,21,"So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared."
16,4,22,"Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day."
16,4,23,"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes,  saving that  every one put them off for washing."
16,5,1,"And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews."
16,5,2,"For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters,  are  many: therefore we take up corn  for them , that we may eat, and live."
16,5,3,"Some  also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth."
16,5,4,"There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute,  and that upon  our lands and vineyards."
16,5,5,"Yet now our flesh  is  as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and  some  of our daughters are brought unto bondage  already : neither  is it  in our power  to redeem them ; for other men have our lands and vineyards."
16,5,6,"And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words."
16,5,7,"Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them."
16,5,8,"And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing  to answer ."
16,5,9,"Also I said, It  is  not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?"
16,5,10,"I likewise,  and  my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury."
16,5,11,"Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth  part  of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them."
16,5,12,"Then said they, We will restore  them , and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise."
16,5,13,"Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the"
16,5,14,"Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king,  that is , twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor."
16,5,15,"But the former governors that  had been  before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God."
16,5,16,"Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants  were  gathered thither unto the work."
16,5,17,"Moreover  there were  at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that  are  about us."
16,5,18,"Now  that  which was prepared  for me  daily  was  one ox  and  six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people."
16,5,19,"Think upon me, my God, for good,  according  to all that I have done for this people."
16,6,1,"Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and  that  there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)"
16,6,2,"That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in  some one of  the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief."
16,6,3,"And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I  am  doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?"
16,6,4,"Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner."
16,6,5,"Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;"
16,6,6,"Wherein  was  written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith  it, that  thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words."
16,6,7,"And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying,  There is  a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together."
16,6,8,"Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart."
16,6,9,"For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore,  O God , strengthen my hands."
16,6,10,"Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who  was  shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee."
16,6,11,"And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who  is there , that,  being  as I  am , would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in."
16,6,12,"And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
16,6,13,"Therefore  was  he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and  that  they might have  matter  for an evil report, that they might reproach me."
16,6,14,"My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear."
16,6,15,"So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth  day  of  the month  Elul, in fifty and two days."
16,6,16,"And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard  thereof , and all the heathen that  were  about us saw  these things , they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God."
16,6,17,"Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and  the letters  of Tobiah came unto them."
16,6,18,"For  there were  many in Judah sworn unto him, because he  was  the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah."
16,6,19,"Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him.  And  Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear."
16,7,1,"Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,"
16,7,2,"That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he  was  a faithful man, and feared God above many."
16,7,3,"And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar  them : and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one  to be  over against his house."
16,7,4,"Now the city  was  large and great: but the people  were  few therein, and the houses  were  not builded."
16,7,5,"And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,"
16,7,6,"These  are  the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;"
16,7,7,"Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number,  I say , of the men of the people of Israel  was this ;"

16,7,61,"And these  were  they which went up  also  from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their father’s house, nor their seed, whether they  were  of Israel."
16,7,62,"The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two."
16,7,63,"And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took  one  of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name."
16,7,64,"These sought their register  among  those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood."
16,7,65,"And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood  up  a priest with Urim and Thummim."
16,7,66,"The whole congregation together  was  forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,"
16,7,67,"Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom  there were  seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women."

16,7,69,"Their  camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses."
16,7,70,"And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons, five hundred and thirty priests’ garments."
16,7,71,"And  some  of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver."
16,7,72,"And  that  which the rest of the people gave  was  twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and seven priests’ garments."
16,7,73,"So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and  some  of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel  were  in their cities."
16,8,1,"And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that  was  before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the"
16,8,2,"And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month."
16,8,3,"And he read therein before the street that  was  before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people  were attentive  unto the book of the law."
16,8,4,"And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah,  and  Meshullam."
16,8,5,"And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:"
16,8,6,"And Ezra blessed the"
16,8,7,"Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people  stood  in their place."
16,8,8,"So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused  them  to understand the reading."
16,8,9,"And Nehemiah, which  is  the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day  is  holy unto the"
16,8,10,"Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for  this  day  is  holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the"
16,8,11,"So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day  is  holy; neither be ye grieved."
16,8,12,"And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them."
16,8,13,"And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law."
16,8,14,"And they found written in the law which the"
16,8,15,"And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as  it is  written."
16,8,16,"So the people went forth, and brought  them , and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim."
16,8,17,"And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness."
16,8,18,"Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day  was  a solemn assembly, according unto the manner."
16,9,1,"Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them."
16,9,2,"And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers."
16,9,3,"And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the"
16,9,4,"Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani,  and  Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the"
16,9,5,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah,  and  Pethahiah, said, Stand up  and  bless the"
16,9,6,"Thou,  even  thou,  art"
16,9,7,"Thou  art  the"
16,9,8,"And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give  it, I say , to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou  art  righteous:"
16,9,9,"And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;"
16,9,10,"And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as  it is  this day."
16,9,11,"And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters."
16,9,12,"Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go."
16,9,13,"Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:"
16,9,14,"And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:"
16,9,15,"And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them."
16,9,16,"But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,"
16,9,17,"And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou  art  a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not."
16,9,18,"Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This  is  thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;"
16,9,19,"Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go."
16,9,20,"Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst."
16,9,21,"Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness,  so that  they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not."
16,9,22,"Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
16,9,23,"Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess  it ."
16,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would."
16,9,25,"And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness."
16,9,26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations."
16,9,27,"Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest  them  from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies."
16,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest  them  from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;"
16,9,29,"And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."
16,9,30,"Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands."
16,9,31,"Nevertheless for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou  art  a gracious and merciful God."
16,9,32,"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day."
16,9,33,"Howbeit thou  art  just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:"
16,9,34,"Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them."
16,9,35,"For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works."
16,9,36,"Behold, we  are  servants this day, and  for  the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we  are  servants in it:"
16,9,37,"And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we  are  in great distress."
16,9,38,"And because of all this we make a sure  covenant , and write  it ; and our princes, Levites,  and  priests, seal  unto it ."
16,10,1,"Now those that sealed  were , Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,"

16,10,29,"They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God’s law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the"
16,10,30,"And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons:"
16,10,31,"And  if  the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell,  that  we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and  that  we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt."
16,10,32,"Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;"
16,10,33,"For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy  things , and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and  for  all the work of the house of our God."
16,10,34,"And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring  it  into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar of the"
16,10,35,"And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the"

16,10,37,"And  that  we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage."
16,10,38,"And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house."
16,10,39,"For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers, where  are  the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God."
16,11,1,"And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts  to dwell  in  other  cities."
16,11,2,"And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem."

16,11,20,"And the residue of Israel, of the priests,  and  the Levites,  were  in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance."
16,11,21,"But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa  were  over the Nethinims."
16,11,22,"The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem  was  Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers  were  over the business of the house of God."
16,11,23,"For  it was  the king’s commandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day."
16,11,24,"And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah,  was  at the king’s hand in all matters concerning the people."
16,11,25,"And for the villages, with their fields,  some  of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjatharba, and  in  the villages thereof, and at Dibon, and  in  the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel, and  in  the villages thereof,"

16,12,23,"The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers,  were  written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib."
16,12,24,"And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise  and  to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward."
16,12,25,"Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,  were  porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates."
16,12,26,"These  were  in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe."
16,12,27,"And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing,  with  cymbals, psalteries, and with harps."
16,12,28,"And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;"
16,12,29,"Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem."
16,12,30,"And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall."
16,12,31,"Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great  companies of them that gave  thanks,  whereof one  went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:"
16,12,32,"And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,"
16,12,33,"And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,"
16,12,34,"Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,"
16,12,35,"And  certain  of the priests’ sons with trumpets;  namely , Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:"
16,12,36,"And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them."
16,12,37,"And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward."
16,12,38,"And the other  company of them that gave  thanks went over against  them , and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;"
16,12,39,"And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate."
16,12,40,"So stood the two  companies of them that gave  thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:"
16,12,41,"And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,  and  Hananiah, with trumpets;"
16,12,42,"And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah  their  overseer."
16,12,43,"Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off."
16,12,44,"And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited."
16,12,45,"And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David,  and  of Solomon his son."
16,12,46,"For in the days of David and Asaph of old  there were  chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God."
16,12,47,"And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified  holy things  unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified  them  unto the children of Aaron."
16,13,1,"On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;"
16,13,2,"Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing."
16,13,3,"Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude."
16,13,4,"And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God,  was  allied unto Tobiah:"
16,13,5,"And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded  to be given  to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests."
16,13,6,"But in all this  time  was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:"
16,13,7,"And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God."
16,13,8,"And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber."
16,13,9,"Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense."
16,13,10,"And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given  them : for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field."
16,13,11,"Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place."
16,13,12,"Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries."
16,13,13,"And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them  was  Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office  was  to distribute unto their brethren."
16,13,14,"Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof."
16,13,15,"In those days saw I in Judah  some  treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all  manner of  burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified  against them  in the day wherein they sold victuals."
16,13,16,"There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem."
16,13,17,"Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing  is  this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?"
16,13,18,"Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath."
16,13,19,"And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and  some  of my servants set I at the gates,  that  there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day."
16,13,20,"So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice."
16,13,21,"Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do  so  again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no  more  on the sabbath."
16,13,22,"And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and  that  they should come  and  keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God,  concerning  this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy."
16,13,23,"In those days also saw I Jews  that  had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon,  and  of Moab:"
16,13,24,"And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people."
16,13,25,"And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God,  saying , Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves."
16,13,26,"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin."
16,13,27,"Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?"
16,13,28,"And  one  of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest,  was  son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me."
16,13,29,"Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites."
16,13,30,"Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;"
16,13,31,"And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good."
17,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this  is  Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia,  over  an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)"
17,1,2,"That  in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which  was  in Shushan the palace,"
17,1,3,"In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces,  being  before him:"
17,1,4,"When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days,  even  an hundred and fourscore days."
17,1,5,"And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace;"
17,1,6,"Where were  white, green, and blue,  hangings , fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds  were of  gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble."
17,1,7,"And they gave  them  drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king."
17,1,8,"And the drinking  was  according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure."
17,1,9,"Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women  in  the royal house which  belonged  to king Ahasuerus."
17,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,"
17,1,11,"To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she  was  fair to look on."
17,1,12,"But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by  his  chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him."
17,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so  was  the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:"
17,1,14,"And the next unto him  was  Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena,  and  Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king’s face,  and  which sat the first in the kingdom;)"
17,1,15,"What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?"
17,1,16,"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that  are  in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus."
17,1,17,"For  this  deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not."
17,1,18,"Likewise  shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king’s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus  shall there arise  too much contempt and wrath."
17,1,19,"If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she."
17,1,20,"And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small."
17,1,21,"And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:"
17,1,22,"For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that  it  should be published according to the language of every people."
17,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her."
17,2,2,"Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:"
17,2,3,"And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given  them :"
17,2,4,"And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so."
17,2,5,"Now  in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name  was  Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;"
17,2,6,"Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away."
17,2,7,"And he brought up Hadassah, that  is , Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid  was  fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter."
17,2,8,"So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women."
17,2,9,"And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens,  which were  meet to be given her, out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best  place  of the house of the women."
17,2,10,"Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew  it ."
17,2,11,"And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her."
17,2,12,"Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished,  to wit , six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with  other  things for the purifying of the women;)"
17,2,13,"Then thus came  every  maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house."
17,2,14,"In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name."
17,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her."
17,2,16,"So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which  is  the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign."
17,2,17,"And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti."
17,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants,  even  Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king."
17,2,19,"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate."
17,2,20,"Esther had not  yet  shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him."
17,2,21,"In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus."
17,2,22,"And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told  it  unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king  thereof  in Mordecai’s name."
17,2,23,"And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king."
17,3,1,"After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that  were  with him."
17,3,2,"And all the king’s servants, that  were  in the king’s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did  him  reverence."
17,3,3,"Then the king’s servants, which  were  in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?"
17,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he  was  a Jew."
17,3,5,"And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath."
17,3,6,"And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that  were  throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus,  even  the people of Mordecai."
17,3,7,"In the first month, that  is , the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that  is , the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month,  to  the twelfth  month , that  is , the month Adar."
17,3,8,"And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws  are  diverse from all people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it  is  not for the king’s profit to suffer them."
17,3,9,"If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring  it  into the king’s treasuries."
17,3,10,"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy."
17,3,11,"And the king said unto Haman, The silver  is  given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee."
17,3,12,"Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that  were  over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and  to  every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king’s ring."
17,3,13,"And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day,  even  upon the thirteenth  day  of the twelfth month, which  is  the month Adar, and  to take  the spoil of them for a prey."
17,3,14,"The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day."
17,3,15,"The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed."
17,4,1,"When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;"
17,4,2,"And came even before the king’s gate: for none  might  enter into the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth."
17,4,3,"And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came,  there was  great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
17,4,4,"So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told  it  her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received  it  not."
17,4,5,"Then called Esther for Hatach,  one  of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it  was , and why it  was ."
17,4,6,"So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which  was  before the king’s gate."
17,4,7,"And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them."
17,4,8,"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew  it  unto Esther, and to declare  it  unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people."
17,4,9,"And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai."
17,4,10,"Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;"
17,4,11,"All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called,  there is  one law of his to put  him  to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days."
17,4,12,"And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words."
17,4,13,"Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews."
17,4,14,"For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time,  then  shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for  such  a time as this?"
17,4,15,"Then Esther bade  them  return Mordecai  this answer ,"
17,4,16,"Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which  is  not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish."
17,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."
17,5,1,"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on  her  royal  apparel , and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house."
17,5,2,"And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court,  that  she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that  was  in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre."
17,5,3,"Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what  is  thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom."
17,5,4,"And Esther answered, If  it seem  good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him."
17,5,5,"Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
17,5,6,"And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What  is  thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what  is  thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."
17,5,7,"Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request  is ;"
17,5,8,"If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said."
17,5,9,"Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai."
17,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife."
17,5,11,"And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all  the things  wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king."
17,5,12,"Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king."
17,5,13,"Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate."
17,5,14,"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made."
17,6,1,"On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king."
17,6,2,"And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus."
17,6,3,"And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him."
17,6,4,"And the king said, Who  is  in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him."
17,6,5,"And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in."
17,6,6,"So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?"
17,6,7,"And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,"
17,6,8,"Let the royal apparel be brought which the king  useth  to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:"
17,6,9,"And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man  withal  whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour."
17,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman, Make haste,  and  take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken."
17,6,11,"Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour."
17,6,12,"And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered."
17,6,13,"And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every  thing  that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai  be  of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him."
17,6,14,"And while they  were  yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared."
17,7,1,"So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen."
17,7,2,"And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What  is  thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what  is  thy request? and it shall be performed,  even  to the half of the kingdom."
17,7,3,"Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:"
17,7,4,"For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king’s damage."
17,7,5,"Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?"
17,7,6,"And Esther said, The adversary and enemy  is  this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen."
17,7,7,"And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath  went  into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king."
17,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther  was . Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face."
17,7,9,"And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon."
17,7,10,"So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified."
17,8,1,"On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he  was  unto her."
17,8,2,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
17,8,3,"And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews."
17,8,4,"Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,"
17,8,5,"And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing  seem  right before the king, and I  be  pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which  are  in all the king’s provinces:"
17,8,6,"For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?"
17,8,7,"Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews."
17,8,8,"Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name, and seal  it  with the king’s ring: for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse."
17,8,9,"Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third month, that  is , the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth  day  thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which  are  from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language."
17,8,10,"And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’ name, and sealed  it  with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback,  and  riders on mules, camels,  and  young dromedaries:"
17,8,11,"Wherein the king granted the Jews which  were  in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them,  both  little ones and women, and  to take  the spoil of them for a prey,"
17,8,12,"Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus,  namely , upon the thirteenth  day  of the twelfth month, which  is  the month Adar."
17,8,13,"The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province  was  published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies."
17,8,14,"So  the posts that rode upon mules  and  camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace."
17,8,15,"And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad."
17,8,16,"The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour."
17,8,17,"And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them."
17,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, that  is , the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)"
17,9,2,"The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people."
17,9,3,"And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them."
17,9,4,"For Mordecai  was  great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater."
17,9,5,"Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them."
17,9,6,"And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men."
17,9,7,"And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,"
17,9,8,"And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,"
17,9,9,"And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,"
17,9,10,"The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand."
17,9,11,"On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king."
17,9,12,"And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what  is  thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what  is  thy request further? and it shall be done."
17,9,13,"Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which  are  in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows."
17,9,14,"And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons."
17,9,15,"For the Jews that  were  in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand."
17,9,16,"But the other Jews that  were  in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,"
17,9,17,"On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
17,9,18,"But the Jews that  were  at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth  day  thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth  day  of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
17,9,19,"Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar  a day of  gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another."
17,9,20,"And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that  were  in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,  both  nigh and far,"
17,9,21,"To stablish  this  among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,"
17,9,22,"As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor."
17,9,23,"And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;"
17,9,24,"Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that  is , the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;"
17,9,25,"But when  Esther  came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows."
17,9,26,"Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and  of that  which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,"
17,9,27,"The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their  appointed  time every year;"
17,9,28,"And  that  these days  should be  remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and  that  these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed."
17,9,29,"Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim."
17,9,30,"And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus,  with  words of peace and truth,"
17,9,31,"To confirm these days of Purim in their times  appointed , according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry."
17,9,32,"And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book."
17,10,1,"And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and  upon  the isles of the sea."
17,10,2,"And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him,  are  they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?"
17,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew  was  next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed."
18,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name  was  Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil."
18,1,2,"And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters."
18,1,3,"His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east."
18,1,4,"And his sons went and feasted  in their  houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them."
18,1,5,"And it was so, when the days of  their  feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings  according  to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually."
18,1,6,"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the"
18,1,7,"And the"
18,1,8,"And the"
18,1,9,"Then Satan answered the"
18,1,10,"Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land."
18,1,11,"But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face."
18,1,12,"And the"
18,1,13,"And there was a day when his sons and his daughters  were  eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:"
18,1,14,"And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:"
18,1,15,"And the Sabeans fell  upon them , and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
18,1,16,"While he  was  yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
18,1,17,"While he  was  yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
18,1,18,"While he  was  yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters  were  eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:"
18,1,19,"And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."
18,1,20,"Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,"
18,1,21,"And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the"
18,1,22,"In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly."
18,2,1,"Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the"
18,2,2,"And the"
18,2,3,"And the"
18,2,4,"And Satan answered the"
18,2,5,"But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face."
18,2,6,"And the"
18,2,7,"So went Satan forth from the presence of the"
18,2,8,"And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes."
18,2,9,"Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die."
18,2,10,"But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips."
18,2,11,"Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him."
18,2,12,"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven."
18,2,13,"So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that  his  grief was very great."
18,3,1,"After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day."
18,3,2,"And Job spake, and said,"
18,3,3,"Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night  in which  it was said, There is a man child conceived."
18,3,4,"Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it."
18,3,5,"Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it."
18,3,6,"As for  that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months."
18,3,7,"Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein."
18,3,8,"Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning."
18,3,9,"Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but  have  none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:"
18,3,10,"Because it shut not up the doors of my  mother’s  womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes."
18,3,11,"Why died I not from the womb?  why  did I  not  give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?"
18,3,12,"Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?"
18,3,13,"For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,"
18,3,14,"With kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;"
18,3,15,"Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:"
18,3,16,"Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants  which  never saw light."
18,3,17,"There the wicked cease  from  troubling; and there the weary be at rest."
18,3,18,"There  the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor."
18,3,19,"The small and great are there; and the servant  is  free from his master."
18,3,20,"Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter  in  soul;"
18,3,21,"Which long for death, but it  cometh  not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;"
18,3,22,"Which rejoice exceedingly,  and  are glad, when they can find the grave?"
18,3,23,"Why is light given  to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?"
18,3,24,"For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters."
18,3,25,"For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me."
18,3,26,"I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came."
18,4,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,"
18,4,2,"If  we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?"
18,4,3,"Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands."
18,4,4,"Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees."
18,4,5,"But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled."
18,4,6,"Is  not  this  thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?"
18,4,7,"Remember, I pray thee, who  ever  perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?"
18,4,8,"Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same."
18,4,9,"By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed."
18,4,10,"The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken."
18,4,11,"The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad."
18,4,12,"Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof."
18,4,13,"In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,"
18,4,14,"Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake."
18,4,15,"Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:"
18,4,16,"It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image  was  before mine eyes,  there was  silence, and I heard a voice,  saying ,"
18,4,17,"Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?"
18,4,18,"Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:"
18,4,19,"How much less  in  them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation  is  in the dust,  which  are crushed before the moth?"
18,4,20,"They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding  it ."
18,4,21,"Doth not their excellency  which is  in them go away? they die, even without wisdom."
18,5,1,"Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?"
18,5,2,"For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one."
18,5,3,"I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation."
18,5,4,"His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither  is there  any to deliver  them ."
18,5,5,"Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance."
18,5,6,"Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;"
18,5,7,"Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward."
18,5,8,"I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:"
18,5,9,"Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:"
18,5,10,"Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:"
18,5,11,"To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety."
18,5,12,"He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform  their  enterprise."
18,5,13,"He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong."
18,5,14,"They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night."
18,5,15,"But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty."
18,5,16,"So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth."
18,5,17,"Behold, happy  is  the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:"
18,5,18,"For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole."
18,5,19,"He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee."
18,5,20,"In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword."
18,5,21,"Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh."
18,5,22,"At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth."
18,5,23,"For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee."
18,5,24,"And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle  shall be  in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin."
18,5,25,"Thou shalt know also that thy seed  shall be  great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth."
18,5,26,"Thou shalt come to  thy  grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season."
18,5,27,"Lo this, we have searched it, so it  is ; hear it, and know thou  it  for thy good."
18,6,1,"But Job answered and said,"
18,6,2,"Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!"
18,6,3,"For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up."
18,6,4,"For the arrows of the Almighty  are  within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me."
18,6,5,"Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?"
18,6,6,"Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there  any  taste in the white of an egg?"
18,6,7,"The things  that  my soul refused to touch  are  as my sorrowful meat."
18,6,8,"Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant  me  the thing that I long for!"
18,6,9,"Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!"
18,6,10,"Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One."
18,6,11,"What  is  my strength, that I should hope? and what  is  mine end, that I should prolong my life?"
18,6,12,"Is  my strength the strength of stones? or  is  my flesh of brass?"
18,6,13,"Is  not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?"
18,6,14,"To him that is afflicted pity  should be shewed  from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty."
18,6,15,"My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,  and  as the stream of brooks they pass away;"
18,6,16,"Which are blackish by reason of the ice,  and  wherein the snow is hid:"
18,6,17,"What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place."
18,6,18,"The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish."
18,6,19,"The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them."
18,6,20,"They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed."
18,6,21,"For now ye are nothing; ye see  my  casting down, and are afraid."
18,6,22,"Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?"
18,6,23,"Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?"
18,6,24,"Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred."
18,6,25,"How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?"
18,6,26,"Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate,  which are  as wind?"
18,6,27,"Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig  a pit  for your friend."
18,6,28,"Now therefore be content, look upon me; for  it is  evident unto you if I lie."
18,6,29,"Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness  is  in it."
18,6,30,"Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?"
18,7,1,"Is there  not an appointed time to man upon earth?  are not  his days also like the days of an hireling?"
18,7,2,"As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for  the reward of  his work:"
18,7,3,"So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me."
18,7,4,"When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day."
18,7,5,"My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome."
18,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope."
18,7,7,"O remember that my life  is  wind: mine eye shall no more see good."
18,7,8,"The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no  more : thine eyes  are  upon me, and I  am  not."
18,7,9,"As  the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no  more ."
18,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more."
18,7,11,"Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul."
18,7,12,"Am  I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?"
18,7,13,"When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;"
18,7,14,"Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:"
18,7,15,"So that my soul chooseth strangling,  and  death rather than my life."
18,7,16,"I loathe  it ; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days  are  vanity."
18,7,17,"What  is  man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?"
18,7,18,"And  that  thou shouldest visit him every morning,  and  try him every moment?"
18,7,19,"How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?"
18,7,20,"I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?"
18,7,21,"And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I  shall  not  be ."
18,8,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
18,8,2,"How long wilt thou speak these  things ? and  how long shall  the words of thy mouth  be like  a strong wind?"
18,8,3,"Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?"
18,8,4,"If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;"
18,8,5,"If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;"
18,8,6,"If thou  wert  pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous."
18,8,7,"Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase."
18,8,8,"For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:"
18,8,9,"(For we  are but of  yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth  are  a shadow:)"
18,8,10,"Shall not they teach thee,  and  tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?"
18,8,11,"Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?"
18,8,12,"Whilst it  is  yet in his greenness,  and  not cut down, it withereth before any  other  herb."
18,8,13,"So  are  the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish:"
18,8,14,"Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust  shall be  a spider’s web."
18,8,15,"He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure."
18,8,16,"He  is  green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden."
18,8,17,"His roots are wrapped about the heap,  and  seeth the place of stones."
18,8,18,"If he destroy him from his place, then  it  shall deny him,  saying , I have not seen thee."
18,8,19,"Behold, this  is  the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow."
18,8,20,"Behold, God will not cast away a perfect  man , neither will he help the evil doers:"
18,8,21,"Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing."
18,8,22,"They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought."
18,9,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,9,2,"I know  it is  so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?"
18,9,3,"If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand."
18,9,4,"He is  wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened  himself  against him, and hath prospered?"
18,9,5,"Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger."
18,9,6,"Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble."
18,9,7,"Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars."
18,9,8,"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea."
18,9,9,"Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south."
18,9,10,"Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number."
18,9,11,"Lo, he goeth by me, and I see  him  not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not."
18,9,12,"Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?"
18,9,13,"If  God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him."
18,9,14,"How much less shall I answer him,  and  choose out my words  to reason  with him?"
18,9,15,"Whom, though I were righteous,  yet  would I not answer,  but  I would make supplication to my judge."
18,9,16,"If I had called, and he had answered me;  yet  would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice."
18,9,17,"For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause."
18,9,18,"He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness."
18,9,19,"If  I speak  of strength, lo,  he is  strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time  to plead ?"
18,9,20,"If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me:  if I say , I  am  perfect, it shall also prove me perverse."
18,9,21,"Though  I  were  perfect,  yet  would I not know my soul: I would despise my life."
18,9,22,"This  is  one  thing , therefore I said  it , He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked."
18,9,23,"If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent."
18,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where,  and  who  is  he?"
18,9,25,"Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good."
18,9,26,"They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle  that  hasteth to the prey."
18,9,27,"If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort  myself :"
18,9,28,"I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent."
18,9,29,"If  I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?"
18,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;"
18,9,31,"Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me."
18,9,32,"For  he is  not a man, as I  am, that  I should answer him,  and  we should come together in judgment."
18,9,33,"Neither is there any daysman betwixt us,  that  might lay his hand upon us both."
18,9,34,"Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:"
18,9,35,"Then  would I speak, and not fear him; but  it is  not so with me."
18,10,1,"My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul."
18,10,2,"I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me."
18,10,3,"Is it  good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?"
18,10,4,"Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?"
18,10,5,"Are  thy days as the days of man?  are  thy years as man’s days,"
18,10,6,"That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?"
18,10,7,"Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and  there is  none that can deliver out of thine hand."
18,10,8,"Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me."
18,10,9,"Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?"
18,10,10,"Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?"
18,10,11,"Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews."
18,10,12,"Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit."
18,10,13,"And these  things  hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this  is  with thee."
18,10,14,"If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity."
18,10,15,"If I be wicked, woe unto me; and  if  I be righteous,  yet  will I not lift up my head.  I am  full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;"
18,10,16,"For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me."
18,10,17,"Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war  are  against me."
18,10,18,"Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!"
18,10,19,"I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave."
18,10,20,"Are  not my days few? cease  then, and  let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,"
18,10,21,"Before I go  whence  I shall not return,  even  to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;"
18,10,22,"A land of darkness, as darkness  itself; and  of the shadow of death, without any order, and  where  the light  is  as darkness."
18,11,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
18,11,2,"Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?"
18,11,3,"Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?"
18,11,4,"For thou hast said, My doctrine  is  pure, and I am clean in thine eyes."
18,11,5,"But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;"
18,11,6,"And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that  they are  double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee  less  than thine iniquity  deserveth ."
18,11,7,"Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?"
18,11,8,"It is  as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?"
18,11,9,"The measure thereof  is  longer than the earth, and broader than the sea."
18,11,10,"If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?"
18,11,11,"For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider  it ?"
18,11,12,"For vain man would be wise, though man be born  like  a wild ass’s colt."
18,11,13,"If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;"
18,11,14,"If iniquity  be  in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles."
18,11,15,"For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:"
18,11,16,"Because thou shalt forget  thy  misery,  and  remember  it  as waters  that  pass away:"
18,11,17,"And  thine  age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning."
18,11,18,"And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig  about thee, and  thou shalt take thy rest in safety."
18,11,19,"Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make  thee  afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee."
18,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope  shall be as  the giving up of the ghost."
18,12,1,"And Job answered and said,"
18,12,2,"No doubt but ye  are  the people, and wisdom shall die with you."
18,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you; I  am  not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?"
18,12,4,"I am  as  one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright  man is  laughed to scorn."
18,12,5,"He that is ready to slip with  his  feet  is as  a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease."
18,12,6,"The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth  abundantly ."
18,12,7,"But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:"
18,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee."
18,12,9,"Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the"
18,12,10,"In whose hand  is  the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind."
18,12,11,"Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?"
18,12,12,"With the ancient  is  wisdom; and in length of days understanding."
18,12,13,"With him  is  wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding."
18,12,14,"Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening."
18,12,15,"Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth."
18,12,16,"With him  is  strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver  are  his."
18,12,17,"He leadeth counsellers away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools."
18,12,18,"He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle."
18,12,19,"He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty."
18,12,20,"He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged."
18,12,21,"He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty."
18,12,22,"He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death."
18,12,23,"He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them  again ."
18,12,24,"He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness  where there is  no way."
18,12,25,"They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like  a  drunken  man ."
18,13,1,"Lo, mine eye hath seen all  this , mine ear hath heard and understood it."
18,13,2,"What ye know,  the same  do I know also: I  am  not inferior unto you."
18,13,3,"Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God."
18,13,4,"But ye  are  forgers of lies, ye  are  all physicians of no value."
18,13,5,"O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom."
18,13,6,"Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips."
18,13,7,"Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?"
18,13,8,"Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?"
18,13,9,"Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye  so  mock him?"
18,13,10,"He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons."
18,13,11,"Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?"
18,13,12,"Your remembrances  are  like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay."
18,13,13,"Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what  will ."
18,13,14,"Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?"
18,13,15,"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him."
18,13,16,"He also  shall be  my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him."
18,13,17,"Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears."
18,13,18,"Behold now, I have ordered  my  cause; I know that I shall be justified."
18,13,19,"Who  is  he  that  will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost."
18,13,20,"Only do not two  things  unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee."
18,13,21,"Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid."
18,13,22,"Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me."
18,13,23,"How many  are  mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin."
18,13,24,"Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?"
18,13,25,"Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?"
18,13,26,"For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth."
18,13,27,"Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet."
18,13,28,"And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten."
18,14,1,"Man  that is  born of a woman  is  of few days, and full of trouble."
18,14,2,"He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not."
18,14,3,"And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?"
18,14,4,"Who can bring a clean  thing  out of an unclean? not one."
18,14,5,"Seeing his days  are  determined, the number of his months  are  with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;"
18,14,6,"Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day."
18,14,7,"For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease."
18,14,8,"Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;"
18,14,9,"Yet  through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant."
18,14,10,"But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where  is  he?"
18,14,11,"As  the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:"
18,14,12,"So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens  be  no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep."
18,14,13,"O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
18,14,14,"If a man die, shall he live  again ? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come."
18,14,15,"Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands."
18,14,16,"For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?"
18,14,17,"My transgression  is  sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity."
18,14,18,"And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place."
18,14,19,"The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow  out  of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man."
18,14,20,"Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away."
18,14,21,"His sons come to honour, and he knoweth  it  not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth  it  not of them."
18,14,22,"But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn."
18,15,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,"
18,15,2,"Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?"
18,15,3,"Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?"
18,15,4,"Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God."
18,15,5,"For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty."
18,15,6,"Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee."
18,15,7,"Art  thou the first man  that  was born? or wast thou made before the hills?"
18,15,8,"Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?"
18,15,9,"What knowest thou, that we know not?  what  understandest thou, which  is  not in us?"
18,15,10,"With us  are  both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father."
18,15,11,"Are  the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?"
18,15,12,"Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,"
18,15,13,"That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest  such  words go out of thy mouth?"
18,15,14,"What  is  man, that he should be clean? and  he which is  born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
18,15,15,"Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight."
18,15,16,"How much more abominable and filthy  is  man, which drinketh iniquity like water?"
18,15,17,"I will shew thee, hear me; and that  which  I have seen I will declare;"
18,15,18,"Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid  it :"
18,15,19,"Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them."
18,15,20,"The wicked man travaileth with pain all  his  days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor."
18,15,21,"A dreadful sound  is  in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him."
18,15,22,"He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword."
18,15,23,"He wandereth abroad for bread,  saying , Where  is it ? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand."
18,15,24,"Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle."
18,15,25,"For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty."
18,15,26,"He runneth upon him,  even  on  his  neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:"
18,15,27,"Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on  his  flanks."
18,15,28,"And he dwelleth in desolate cities,  and  in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps."
18,15,29,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth."
18,15,30,"He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away."
18,15,31,"Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence."
18,15,32,"It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green."
18,15,33,"He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive."
18,15,34,"For the congregation of hypocrites  shall be  desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery."
18,15,35,"They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit."
18,16,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,16,2,"I have heard many such things: miserable comforters  are  ye all."
18,16,3,"Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?"
18,16,4,"I also could speak as ye  do : if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you."
18,16,5,"But  I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage  your grief ."
18,16,6,"Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and  though  I forbear, what am I eased?"
18,16,7,"But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company."
18,16,8,"And thou hast filled me with wrinkles,  which  is a witness  against me : and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face."
18,16,9,"He teareth  me  in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me."
18,16,10,"They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me."
18,16,11,"God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked."
18,16,12,"I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken  me  by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark."
18,16,13,"His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground."
18,16,14,"He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant."
18,16,15,"I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust."
18,16,16,"My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids  is  the shadow of death;"
18,16,17,"Not for  any  injustice in mine hands: also my prayer  is  pure."
18,16,18,"O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place."
18,16,19,"Also now, behold, my witness  is  in heaven, and my record  is  on high."
18,16,20,"My friends scorn me:  but  mine eye poureth out  tears  unto God."
18,16,21,"O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man  pleadeth  for his neighbour!"
18,16,22,"When a few years are come, then I shall go the way  whence  I shall not return."
18,17,1,"My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves  are ready  for me."
18,17,2,"Are there  not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?"
18,17,3,"Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who  is  he  that  will strike hands with me?"
18,17,4,"For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt  them ."
18,17,5,"He that speaketh flattery to  his  friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail."
18,17,6,"He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret."
18,17,7,"Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members  are  as a shadow."
18,17,8,"Upright  men  shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite."
18,17,9,"The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger."
18,17,10,"But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find  one  wise  man  among you."
18,17,11,"My days are past, my purposes are broken off,  even  the thoughts of my heart."
18,17,12,"They change the night into day: the light  is  short because of darkness."
18,17,13,"If I wait, the grave  is  mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness."
18,17,14,"I have said to corruption, Thou  art  my father: to the worm,  Thou art  my mother, and my sister."
18,17,15,"And where  is  now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?"
18,17,16,"They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when  our  rest together  is  in the dust."
18,18,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
18,18,2,"How long  will it be ere  ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak."
18,18,3,"Wherefore are we counted as beasts,  and  reputed vile in your sight?"
18,18,4,"He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?"
18,18,5,"Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine."
18,18,6,"The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him."
18,18,7,"The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down."
18,18,8,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare."
18,18,9,"The gin shall take  him  by the heel,  and  the robber shall prevail against him."
18,18,10,"The snare  is  laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way."
18,18,11,"Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet."
18,18,12,"His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction  shall be  ready at his side."
18,18,13,"It shall devour the strength of his skin:  even  the firstborn of death shall devour his strength."
18,18,14,"His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors."
18,18,15,"It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because  it is  none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation."
18,18,16,"His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off."
18,18,17,"His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street."
18,18,18,"He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world."
18,18,19,"He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings."
18,18,20,"They that come after  him  shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted."
18,18,21,"Surely such  are  the dwellings of the wicked, and this  is  the place  of him that  knoweth not God."
18,19,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,19,2,"How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?"
18,19,3,"These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed  that  ye make yourselves strange to me."
18,19,4,"And be it indeed  that  I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself."
18,19,5,"If indeed ye will magnify  yourselves  against me, and plead against me my reproach:"
18,19,6,"Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net."
18,19,7,"Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but  there is  no judgment."
18,19,8,"He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths."
18,19,9,"He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown  from  my head."
18,19,10,"He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree."
18,19,11,"He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as  one of  his enemies."
18,19,12,"His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle."
18,19,13,"He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me."
18,19,14,"My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me."
18,19,15,"They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight."
18,19,16,"I called my servant, and he gave  me  no answer; I intreated him with my mouth."
18,19,17,"My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children’s  sake  of mine own body."
18,19,18,"Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me."
18,19,19,"All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me."
18,19,20,"My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth."
18,19,21,"Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me."
18,19,22,"Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?"
18,19,23,"Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!"
18,19,24,"That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!"
18,19,25,"For I know  that  my redeemer liveth, and  that  he shall stand at the latter  day  upon the earth:"
18,19,26,"And  though  after my skin  worms  destroy this  body , yet in my flesh shall I see God:"
18,19,27,"Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another;  though  my reins be consumed within me."
18,19,28,"But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?"
18,19,29,"Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath  bringeth  the punishments of the sword, that ye may know  there is  a judgment."
18,20,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
18,20,2,"Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for  this  I make haste."
18,20,3,"I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer."
18,20,4,"Knowest thou  not  this of old, since man was placed upon earth,"
18,20,5,"That the triumphing of the wicked  is  short, and the joy of the hypocrite  but  for a moment?"
18,20,6,"Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;"
18,20,7,"Yet  he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where  is  he?"
18,20,8,"He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night."
18,20,9,"The eye also  which  saw him shall  see him  no more; neither shall his place any more behold him."
18,20,10,"His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods."
18,20,11,"His bones are full  of the sin  of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust."
18,20,12,"Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,  though  he hide it under his tongue;"
18,20,13,"Though  he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:"
18,20,14,"Yet  his meat in his bowels is turned,  it is  the gall of asps within him."
18,20,15,"He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly."
18,20,16,"He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him."
18,20,17,"He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter."
18,20,18,"That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow  it  down: according to  his  substance  shall  the restitution  be , and he shall not rejoice  therein ."
18,20,19,"Because he hath oppressed  and  hath forsaken the poor;  because  he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;"
18,20,20,"Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired."
18,20,21,"There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods."
18,20,22,"In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him."
18,20,23,"When  he is about to fill his belly,  God  shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain  it  upon him while he is eating."
18,20,24,"He shall flee from the iron weapon,  and  the bow of steel shall strike him through."
18,20,25,"It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors  are  upon him."
18,20,26,"All darkness  shall be  hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle."
18,20,27,"The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him."
18,20,28,"The increase of his house shall depart,  and his goods  shall flow away in the day of his wrath."
18,20,29,"This  is  the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God."
18,21,1,"But Job answered and said,"
18,21,2,"Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations."
18,21,3,"Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on."
18,21,4,"As for me,  is  my complaint to man? and if  it were so , why should not my spirit be troubled?"
18,21,5,"Mark me, and be astonished, and lay  your  hand upon  your  mouth."
18,21,6,"Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh."
18,21,7,"Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?"
18,21,8,"Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes."
18,21,9,"Their houses  are  safe from fear, neither  is  the rod of God upon them."
18,21,10,"Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf."
18,21,11,"They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance."
18,21,12,"They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ."
18,21,13,"They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave."
18,21,14,"Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways."
18,21,15,"What  is  the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?"
18,21,16,"Lo, their good  is  not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
18,21,17,"How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and  how oft  cometh their destruction upon them!  God  distributeth sorrows in his anger."
18,21,18,"They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away."
18,21,19,"God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know  it ."
18,21,20,"His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
18,21,21,"For what pleasure  hath  he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?"
18,21,22,"Shall  any  teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high."
18,21,23,"One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet."
18,21,24,"His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow."
18,21,25,"And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure."
18,21,26,"They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them."
18,21,27,"Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices  which  ye wrongfully imagine against me."
18,21,28,"For ye say, Where  is  the house of the prince? and where  are  the dwelling places of the wicked?"
18,21,29,"Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,"
18,21,30,"That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath."
18,21,31,"Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him  what  he hath done?"
18,21,32,"Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb."
18,21,33,"The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as  there are  innumerable before him."
18,21,34,"How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?"
18,22,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,"
18,22,2,"Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?"
18,22,3,"Is it  any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or  is it  gain  to him , that thou makest thy ways perfect?"
18,22,4,"Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?"
18,22,5,"Is  not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?"
18,22,6,"For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing."
18,22,7,"Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry."
18,22,8,"But  as for  the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it."
18,22,9,"Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken."
18,22,10,"Therefore snares  are  round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;"
18,22,11,"Or darkness,  that  thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee."
18,22,12,"Is  not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!"
18,22,13,"And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?"
18,22,14,"Thick clouds  are  a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven."
18,22,15,"Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?"
18,22,16,"Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:"
18,22,17,"Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?"
18,22,18,"Yet he filled their houses with good  things : but the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
18,22,19,"The righteous see  it , and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn."
18,22,20,"Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth."
18,22,21,"Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee."
18,22,22,"Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart."
18,22,23,"If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles."
18,22,24,"Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the  gold  of Ophir as the stones of the brooks."
18,22,25,"Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver."
18,22,26,"For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God."
18,22,27,"Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows."
18,22,28,"Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways."
18,22,29,"When  men  are cast down, then thou shalt say,  There is  lifting up; and he shall save the humble person."
18,22,30,"He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands."
18,23,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,23,2,"Even to day  is  my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning."
18,23,3,"Oh that I knew where I might find him!  that  I might come  even  to his seat!"
18,23,4,"I would order  my  cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments."
18,23,5,"I would know the words  which  he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me."
18,23,6,"Will he plead against me with  his  great power? No; but he would put  strength  in me."
18,23,7,"There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge."
18,23,8,"Behold, I go forward, but he  is  not  there ; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:"
18,23,9,"On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold  him : he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see  him :"
18,23,10,"But he knoweth the way that I take:  when  he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold."
18,23,11,"My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined."
18,23,12,"Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary  food ."
18,23,13,"But he  is  in one  mind , and who can turn him? and  what  his soul desireth, even  that  he doeth."
18,23,14,"For he performeth  the thing that is  appointed for me: and many such  things are  with him."
18,23,15,"Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him."
18,23,16,"For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:"
18,23,17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness,  neither  hath he covered the darkness from my face."
18,24,1,"Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?"
18,24,2,"Some  remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed  thereof ."
18,24,3,"They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge."
18,24,4,"They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together."
18,24,5,"Behold,  as  wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness  yieldeth  food for them  and  for  their  children."
18,24,6,"They reap  every one  his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked."
18,24,7,"They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that  they have  no covering in the cold."
18,24,8,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter."
18,24,9,"They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor."
18,24,10,"They cause  him  to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf  from  the hungry;"
18,24,11,"Which  make oil within their walls,  and  tread  their  winepresses, and suffer thirst."
18,24,12,"Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly  to them ."
18,24,13,"They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof."
18,24,14,"The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief."
18,24,15,"The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth  his  face."
18,24,16,"In the dark they dig through houses,  which  they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light."
18,24,17,"For the morning  is  to them even as the shadow of death: if  one  know  them, they are in  the terrors of the shadow of death."
18,24,18,"He  is  swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards."
18,24,19,"Drought and heat consume the snow waters:  so doth  the grave  those which  have sinned."
18,24,20,"The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree."
18,24,21,"He evil entreateth the barren  that  beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow."
18,24,22,"He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no  man  is sure of life."
18,24,23,"Though  it be given him  to be  in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes  are  upon their ways."
18,24,24,"They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all  other , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn."
18,24,25,"And if  it be  not  so  now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?"
18,25,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
18,25,2,"Dominion and fear  are  with him, he maketh peace in his high places."
18,25,3,"Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?"
18,25,4,"How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean  that is  born of a woman?"
18,25,5,"Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight."
18,25,6,"How much less man,  that is  a worm? and the son of man,  which is  a worm?"
18,26,1,"But Job answered and said,"
18,26,2,"How hast thou helped  him that is  without power?  how  savest thou the arm  that hath  no strength?"
18,26,3,"How hast thou counselled  him that hath  no wisdom? and  how  hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?"
18,26,4,"To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?"
18,26,5,"Dead  things  are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof."
18,26,6,"Hell  is  naked before him, and destruction hath no covering."
18,26,7,"He stretcheth out the north over the empty place,  and  hangeth the earth upon nothing."
18,26,8,"He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them."
18,26,9,"He holdeth back the face of his throne,  and  spreadeth his cloud upon it."
18,26,10,"He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end."
18,26,11,"The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof."
18,26,12,"He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud."
18,26,13,"By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent."
18,26,14,"Lo, these  are  parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?"
18,27,1,"Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,"
18,27,2,"As  God liveth,  who  hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty,  who  hath vexed my soul;"
18,27,3,"All the while my breath  is  in me, and the spirit of God  is  in my nostrils;"
18,27,4,"My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit."
18,27,5,"God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me."
18,27,6,"My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach  me  so long as I live."
18,27,7,"Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous."
18,27,8,"For what  is  the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?"
18,27,9,"Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?"
18,27,10,"Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?"
18,27,11,"I will teach you by the hand of God:  that  which  is  with the Almighty will I not conceal."
18,27,12,"Behold, all ye yourselves have seen  it ; why then are ye thus altogether vain?"
18,27,13,"This  is  the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors,  which  they shall receive of the Almighty."
18,27,14,"If his children be multiplied,  it is  for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread."
18,27,15,"Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep."
18,27,16,"Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;"
18,27,17,"He may prepare  it , but the just shall put  it  on, and the innocent shall divide the silver."
18,27,18,"He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth  that  the keeper maketh."
18,27,19,"The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he  is  not."
18,27,20,"Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night."
18,27,21,"The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place."
18,27,22,"For  God  shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand."
18,27,23,"Men  shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place."
18,28,1,"Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold  where  they fine  it ."
18,28,2,"Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass  is  molten  out of  the stone."
18,28,3,"He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death."
18,28,4,"The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant;  even the waters  forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men."
18,28,5,"As for  the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire."
18,28,6,"The stones of it  are  the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold."
18,28,7,"There is  a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s eye hath not seen:"
18,28,8,"The lion’s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it."
18,28,9,"He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots."
18,28,10,"He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing."
18,28,11,"He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and  the thing that is  hid bringeth he forth to light."
18,28,12,"But where shall wisdom be found? and where  is  the place of understanding?"
18,28,13,"Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living."
18,28,14,"The depth saith, It  is  not in me: and the sea saith,  It is  not with me."
18,28,15,"It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed  for  the price thereof."
18,28,16,"It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire."
18,28,17,"The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it  shall not be for  jewels of fine gold."
18,28,18,"No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom  is  above rubies."
18,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold."
18,28,20,"Whence then cometh wisdom? and where  is  the place of understanding?"
18,28,21,"Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air."
18,28,22,"Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears."
18,28,23,"God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof."
18,28,24,"For he looketh to the ends of the earth,  and  seeth under the whole heaven;"
18,28,25,"To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure."
18,28,26,"When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:"
18,28,27,"Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out."
18,28,28,"And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that  is  wisdom; and to depart from evil  is  understanding."
18,29,1,"Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,"
18,29,2,"Oh that I were as  in  months past, as  in  the days  when  God preserved me;"
18,29,3,"When his candle shined upon my head,  and when  by his light I walked  through  darkness;"
18,29,4,"As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God  was  upon my tabernacle;"
18,29,5,"When the Almighty  was  yet with me,  when  my children  were  about me;"
18,29,6,"When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;"
18,29,7,"When I went out to the gate through the city,  when  I prepared my seat in the street!"
18,29,8,"The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose,  and  stood up."
18,29,9,"The princes refrained talking, and laid  their  hand on their mouth."
18,29,10,"The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth."
18,29,11,"When the ear heard  me , then it blessed me; and when the eye saw  me , it gave witness to me:"
18,29,12,"Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and  him that had  none to help him."
18,29,13,"The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy."
18,29,14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment  was  as a robe and a diadem."
18,29,15,"I was eyes to the blind, and feet  was  I to the lame."
18,29,16,"I  was  a father to the poor: and the cause  which  I knew not I searched out."
18,29,17,"And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth."
18,29,18,"Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply  my  days as the sand."
18,29,19,"My root  was  spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch."
18,29,20,"My glory  was  fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand."
18,29,21,"Unto me  men  gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel."
18,29,22,"After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them."
18,29,23,"And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide  as  for the latter rain."
18,29,24,"If  I laughed on them, they believed  it  not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down."
18,29,25,"I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one  that  comforteth the mourners."
18,30,1,"But now  they that are  younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock."
18,30,2,"Yea, whereto  might  the strength of their hands  profit  me, in whom old age was perished?"
18,30,3,"For want and famine  they were  solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste."
18,30,4,"Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots  for  their meat."
18,30,5,"They were driven forth from among  men , (they cried after them as  after  a thief;)"
18,30,6,"To dwell in the clifts of the valleys,  in  caves of the earth, and  in  the rocks."
18,30,7,"Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together."
18,30,8,"They were  children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth."
18,30,9,"And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword."
18,30,10,"They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face."
18,30,11,"Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me."
18,30,12,"Upon  my  right  hand  rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction."
18,30,13,"They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper."
18,30,14,"They came  upon me  as a wide breaking in  of waters : in the desolation they rolled themselves  upon me ."
18,30,15,"Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud."
18,30,16,"And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me."
18,30,17,"My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest."
18,30,18,"By the great force  of my disease  is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat."
18,30,19,"He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes."
18,30,20,"I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me  not ."
18,30,21,"Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me."
18,30,22,"Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride  upon it , and dissolvest my substance."
18,30,23,"For I know  that  thou wilt bring me  to  death, and  to  the house appointed for all living."
18,30,24,"Howbeit he will not stretch out  his  hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction."
18,30,25,"Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was  not  my soul grieved for the poor?"
18,30,26,"When I looked for good, then evil came  unto me : and when I waited for light, there came darkness."
18,30,27,"My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me."
18,30,28,"I went mourning without the sun: I stood up,  and  I cried in the congregation."
18,30,29,"I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls."
18,30,30,"My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat."
18,30,31,"My harp also is  turned  to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep."
18,31,1,"I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?"
18,31,2,"For what portion of God  is there  from above? and  what  inheritance of the Almighty from on high?"
18,31,3,"Is  not destruction to the wicked? and a strange  punishment  to the workers of iniquity?"
18,31,4,"Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?"
18,31,5,"If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;"
18,31,6,"Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity."
18,31,7,"If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;"
18,31,8,"Then  let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out."
18,31,9,"If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or  if  I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door;"
18,31,10,"Then  let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her."
18,31,11,"For this  is  an heinous crime; yea, it  is  an iniquity  to be punished by  the judges."
18,31,12,"For it  is  a fire  that  consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase."
18,31,13,"If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;"
18,31,14,"What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?"
18,31,15,"Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?"
18,31,16,"If I have withheld the poor from  their  desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;"
18,31,17,"Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;"
18,31,18,"(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as  with  a father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;)"
18,31,19,"If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;"
18,31,20,"If his loins have not blessed me, and  if  he were  not  warmed with the fleece of my sheep;"
18,31,21,"If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:"
18,31,22,"Then  let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone."
18,31,23,"For destruction  from  God  was  a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure."
18,31,24,"If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold,  Thou art  my confidence;"
18,31,25,"If I rejoiced because my wealth  was  great, and because mine hand had gotten much;"
18,31,26,"If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking  in  brightness;"
18,31,27,"And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:"
18,31,28,"This also  were  an iniquity  to be punished by  the judge: for I should have denied the God  that is  above."
18,31,29,"If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:"
18,31,30,"Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul."
18,31,31,"If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied."
18,31,32,"The stranger did not lodge in the street:  but  I opened my doors to the traveller."
18,31,33,"If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:"
18,31,34,"Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence,  and  went not out of the door?"
18,31,35,"Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire  is, that  the Almighty would answer me, and  that  mine adversary had written a book."
18,31,36,"Surely I would take it upon my shoulder,  and  bind it  as  a crown to me."
18,31,37,"I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him."
18,31,38,"If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;"
18,31,39,"If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:"
18,31,40,"Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended."
18,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he  was  righteous in his own eyes."
18,32,2,"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God."
18,32,3,"Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and  yet  had condemned Job."
18,32,4,"Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they  were  elder than he."
18,32,5,"When Elihu saw that  there was  no answer in the mouth of  these  three men, then his wrath was kindled."
18,32,6,"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I  am  young, and ye  are  very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion."
18,32,7,"I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom."
18,32,8,"But  there is  a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding."
18,32,9,"Great men are not  always  wise: neither do the aged understand judgment."
18,32,10,"Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion."
18,32,11,"Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say."
18,32,12,"Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold,  there was  none of you that convinced Job,  or  that answered his words:"
18,32,13,"Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man."
18,32,14,"Now he hath not directed  his  words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches."
18,32,15,"They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking."
18,32,16,"When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still,  and  answered no more;)"
18,32,17,"I said , I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion."
18,32,18,"For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me."
18,32,19,"Behold, my belly  is  as wine  which  hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles."
18,32,20,"I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer."
18,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man."
18,32,22,"For I know not to give flattering titles;  in so doing  my maker would soon take me away."
18,33,1,"Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words."
18,33,2,"Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth."
18,33,3,"My words  shall be of  the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly."
18,33,4,"The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life."
18,33,5,"If thou canst answer me, set  thy words  in order before me, stand up."
18,33,6,"Behold, I  am  according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay."
18,33,7,"Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee."
18,33,8,"Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of  thy  words,  saying ,"
18,33,9,"I am clean without transgression, I  am  innocent; neither  is there  iniquity in me."
18,33,10,"Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,"
18,33,11,"He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths."
18,33,12,"Behold,  in  this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man."
18,33,13,"Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters."
18,33,14,"For God speaketh once, yea twice,  yet man  perceiveth it not."
18,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;"
18,33,16,"Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,"
18,33,17,"That he may withdraw man  from his  purpose, and hide pride from man."
18,33,18,"He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword."
18,33,19,"He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong  pain :"
18,33,20,"So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat."
18,33,21,"His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones  that  were not seen stick out."
18,33,22,"Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers."
18,33,23,"If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:"
18,33,24,"Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom."
18,33,25,"His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:"
18,33,26,"He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness."
18,33,27,"He looketh upon men, and  if any  say, I have sinned, and perverted  that which was  right, and it profited me not;"
18,33,28,"He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light."
18,33,29,"Lo, all these  things  worketh God oftentimes with man,"
18,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living."
18,33,31,"Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak."
18,33,32,"If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee."
18,33,33,"If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom."
18,34,1,"Furthermore Elihu answered and said,"
18,34,2,"Hear my words, O ye wise  men ; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge."
18,34,3,"For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat."
18,34,4,"Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what  is  good."
18,34,5,"For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment."
18,34,6,"Should I lie against my right? my wound  is  incurable without transgression."
18,34,7,"What man  is  like Job,  who  drinketh up scorning like water?"
18,34,8,"Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men."
18,34,9,"For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God."
18,34,10,"Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God,  that he should do  wickedness; and  from  the Almighty,  that he should commit  iniquity."
18,34,11,"For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to  his  ways."
18,34,12,"Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment."
18,34,13,"Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?"
18,34,14,"If he set his heart upon man,  if  he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;"
18,34,15,"All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust."
18,34,16,"If now  thou hast  understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words."
18,34,17,"Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?"
18,34,18,"Is it fit  to say to a king,  Thou art  wicked?  and  to princes,  Ye are  ungodly?"
18,34,19,"How much less to him  that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all  are  the work of his hands."
18,34,20,"In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand."
18,34,21,"For his eyes  are  upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings."
18,34,22,"There is  no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
18,34,23,"For he will not lay upon man more  than right ; that he should enter into judgment with God."
18,34,24,"He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead."
18,34,25,"Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth  them  in the night, so that they are destroyed."
18,34,26,"He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;"
18,34,27,"Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:"
18,34,28,"So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted."
18,34,29,"When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth  his  face, who then can behold him? whether  it be done  against a nation, or against a man only:"
18,34,30,"That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared."
18,34,31,"Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne  chastisement , I will not offend  any more :"
18,34,32,"That which  I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more."
18,34,33,"Should it be  according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest."
18,34,34,"Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me."
18,34,35,"Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words  were  without wisdom."
18,34,36,"My desire  is that  Job may be tried unto the end because of  his  answers for wicked men."
18,34,37,"For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth  his hands  among us, and multiplieth his words against God."
18,35,1,"Elihu spake moreover, and said,"
18,35,2,"Thinkest thou this to be right,  that  thou saidst, My righteousness  is  more than God’s?"
18,35,3,"For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee?  and , What profit shall I have,  if I be cleansed  from my sin?"
18,35,4,"I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee."
18,35,5,"Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds  which  are higher than thou."
18,35,6,"If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or  if  thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?"
18,35,7,"If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?"
18,35,8,"Thy wickedness  may hurt  a man as thou  art ; and thy righteousness  may profit  the son of man."
18,35,9,"By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make  the oppressed  to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty."
18,35,10,"But none saith, Where  is  God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;"
18,35,11,"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?"
18,35,12,"There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men."
18,35,13,"Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it."
18,35,14,"Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him,  yet  judgment  is  before him; therefore trust thou in him."
18,35,15,"But now, because  it is  not  so , he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth  it  not in great extremity:"
18,35,16,"Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge."
18,36,1,"Elihu also proceeded, and said,"
18,36,2,"Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that  I have  yet to speak on God’s behalf."
18,36,3,"I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
18,36,4,"For truly my words  shall  not  be  false: he that is perfect in knowledge  is  with thee."
18,36,5,"Behold, God  is  mighty, and despiseth not  any: he is  mighty in strength  and  wisdom."
18,36,6,"He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor."
18,36,7,"He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings  are they  on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted."
18,36,8,"And if  they be  bound in fetters,  and  be holden in cords of affliction;"
18,36,9,"Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded."
18,36,10,"He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity."
18,36,11,"If they obey and serve  him , they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures."
18,36,12,"But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge."
18,36,13,"But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them."
18,36,14,"They die in youth, and their life  is  among the unclean."
18,36,15,"He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression."
18,36,16,"Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait  into  a broad place, where  there is  no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table  should be  full of fatness."
18,36,17,"But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold  on thee ."
18,36,18,"Because  there is  wrath,  beware  lest he take thee away with  his  stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee."
18,36,19,"Will he esteem thy riches?  no , not gold, nor all the forces of strength."
18,36,20,"Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place."
18,36,21,"Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction."
18,36,22,"Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?"
18,36,23,"Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?"
18,36,24,"Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold."
18,36,25,"Every man may see it; man may behold  it  afar off."
18,36,26,"Behold, God  is  great, and we know  him  not, neither can the number of his years be searched out."
18,36,27,"For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:"
18,36,28,"Which the clouds do drop  and  distil upon man abundantly."
18,36,29,"Also can  any  understand the spreadings of the clouds,  or  the noise of his tabernacle?"
18,36,30,"Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea."
18,36,31,"For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance."
18,36,32,"With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it  not to shine  by  the cloud  that cometh betwixt."
18,36,33,"The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour."
18,37,1,"At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place."
18,37,2,"Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound  that  goeth out of his mouth."
18,37,3,"He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth."
18,37,4,"After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard."
18,37,5,"God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend."
18,37,6,"For he saith to the snow, Be thou  on  the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength."
18,37,7,"He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work."
18,37,8,"Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places."
18,37,9,"Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north."
18,37,10,"By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened."
18,37,11,"Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:"
18,37,12,"And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth."
18,37,13,"He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy."
18,37,14,"Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God."
18,37,15,"Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?"
18,37,16,"Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?"
18,37,17,"How thy garments  are  warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south  wind ?"
18,37,18,"Hast thou with him spread out the sky,  which is  strong,  and  as a molten looking glass?"
18,37,19,"Teach us what we shall say unto him;  for  we cannot order  our speech  by reason of darkness."
18,37,20,"Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up."
18,37,21,"And now  men  see not the bright light which  is  in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them."
18,37,22,"Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God  is  terrible majesty."
18,37,23,"Touching  the Almighty, we cannot find him out:  he is  excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict."
18,37,24,"Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any  that are  wise of heart."
18,38,1,"Then the"
18,38,2,"Who  is  this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?"
18,38,3,"Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me."
18,38,4,"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding."
18,38,5,"Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?"
18,38,6,"Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;"
18,38,7,"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
18,38,8,"Or  who  shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth,  as if  it had issued out of the womb?"
18,38,9,"When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,"
18,38,10,"And brake up for it my decreed  place , and set bars and doors,"
18,38,11,"And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?"
18,38,12,"Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;  and  caused the dayspring to know his place;"
18,38,13,"That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?"
18,38,14,"It is turned as clay  to  the seal; and they stand as a garment."
18,38,15,"And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken."
18,38,16,"Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?"
18,38,17,"Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?"
18,38,18,"Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all."
18,38,19,"Where  is  the way  where  light dwelleth? and  as for  darkness, where  is  the place thereof,"
18,38,20,"That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths  to  the house thereof?"
18,38,21,"Knowest thou  it , because thou wast then born? or  because  the number of thy days  is  great?"
18,38,22,"Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,"
18,38,23,"Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?"
18,38,24,"By what way is the light parted,  which  scattereth the east wind upon the earth?"
18,38,25,"Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;"
18,38,26,"To cause it to rain on the earth,  where  no man  is; on  the wilderness, wherein  there is  no man;"
18,38,27,"To satisfy the desolate and waste  ground ; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?"
18,38,28,"Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?"
18,38,29,"Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?"
18,38,30,"The waters are hid as  with  a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen."
18,38,31,"Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?"
18,38,32,"Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?"
18,38,33,"Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?"
18,38,34,"Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?"

18,39,10,"Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?"
18,39,11,"Wilt thou trust him, because his strength  is  great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?"
18,39,12,"Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather  it into  thy barn?"

18,39,22,"He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword."
18,39,23,"The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield."
18,39,24,"He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that  it is  the sound of the trumpet."
18,39,25,"He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting."
18,39,26,"Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom,  and  stretch her wings toward the south?"
18,39,27,"Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?"
18,39,28,"She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place."

18,40,14,"Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee."
18,40,15,"Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox."
18,40,16,"Lo now, his strength  is  in his loins, and his force  is  in the navel of his belly."
18,40,17,"He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together."
18,40,18,"His bones  are as  strong pieces of brass; his bones  are  like bars of iron."
18,40,19,"He  is  the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach  unto him ."
18,40,20,"Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play."
18,40,21,"He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens."
18,40,22,"The shady trees cover him  with  their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about."
18,40,23,"Behold, he drinketh up a river,  and  hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth."
18,40,24,"He taketh it with his eyes:  his  nose pierceth through snares."
18,41,1,"Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord  which  thou lettest down?"
18,41,2,"Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?"
18,41,3,"Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft  words  unto thee?"
18,41,4,"Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?"
18,41,5,"Wilt thou play with him as  with  a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?"
18,41,6,"Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?"
18,41,7,"Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?"
18,41,8,"Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more."
18,41,9,"Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not  one  be cast down even at the sight of him?"
18,41,10,"None  is so  fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?"
18,41,11,"Who hath prevented me, that I should repay  him? whatsoever is  under the whole heaven is mine."
18,41,12,"I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion."
18,41,13,"Who can discover the face of his garment?  or  who can come  to him  with his double bridle?"
18,41,14,"Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth  are  terrible round about."
18,41,15,"His  scales  are his  pride, shut up together  as with  a close seal."
18,41,16,"One is so near to another, that no air can come between them."
18,41,17,"They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered."
18,41,18,"By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes  are  like the eyelids of the morning."
18,41,19,"Out of his mouth go burning lamps,  and  sparks of fire leap out."
18,41,20,"Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as  out  of a seething pot or caldron."
18,41,21,"His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth."
18,41,22,"In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him."
18,41,23,"The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved."
18,41,24,"His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether  millstone ."
18,41,25,"When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves."
18,41,26,"The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon."
18,41,27,"He esteemeth iron as straw,  and  brass as rotten wood."
18,41,28,"The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble."
18,41,29,"Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear."
18,41,30,"Sharp stones  are  under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire."
18,41,31,"He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment."
18,41,32,"He maketh a path to shine after him;  one  would think the deep  to be  hoary."
18,41,33,"Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear."
18,41,34,"He beholdeth all high  things : he  is  a king over all the children of pride."
18,42,1,"Then Job answered the"
18,42,2,"I know that thou canst do every  thing , and  that  no thought can be withholden from thee."
18,42,3,"Who  is  he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not."
18,42,4,"Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me."
18,42,5,"I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee."
18,42,6,"Wherefore I abhor  myself , and repent in dust and ashes."
18,42,7,"And it was  so , that after the"
18,42,8,"Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you  after your  folly, in that ye have not spoken of me  the thing which is  right, like my servant Job."
18,42,9,"So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite  and  Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the"

18,42,14,"And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch."
18,42,15,"And in all the land were no women found  so  fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren."
18,42,16,"After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons,  even  four generations."
18,42,17,"So Job died,  being  old and full of days."
19,1,1,"Blessed  is  the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful."
19,1,2,"But his delight  is  in the law of the"

19,78,59,"When God heard  this , he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:"
19,78,60,"So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent  which  he placed among men;"
19,78,61,"And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand."

19,105,21,"He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:"
19,105,22,"To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom."
19,105,23,"Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham."
19,105,24,"And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies."
19,105,25,"He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants."
19,105,26,"He sent Moses his servant;  and  Aaron whom he had chosen."
19,105,27,"They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham."
19,105,28,"He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word."
19,105,29,"He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish."
19,105,30,"Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings."
19,105,31,"He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies,  and  lice in all their coasts."
19,105,32,"He gave them hail for rain,  and  flaming fire in their land."
19,105,33,"He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts."
19,105,34,"He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,"
19,105,35,"And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground."
19,105,36,"He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength."
19,105,37,"He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and  there was  not one feeble  person  among their tribes."
19,105,38,"Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them."
19,105,39,"He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night."
19,105,40,"The people  asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven."
19,105,41,"He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places  like  a river."
19,105,42,"For he remembered his holy promise,  and  Abraham his servant."
19,105,43,"And he brought forth his people with joy,  and  his chosen with gladness:"
19,105,44,"And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;"
19,105,45,"That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the"

19,106,7,"Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked  him  at the sea,  even  at the Red sea."
19,106,8,"Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known."
19,106,9,"He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness."
19,106,10,"And he saved them from the hand of him that hated  them , and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy."
19,106,11,"And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left."
19,106,12,"Then believed they his words; they sang his praise."
19,106,13,"They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:"
19,106,14,"But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert."
19,106,15,"And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul."
19,106,16,"They envied Moses also in the camp,  and  Aaron the saint of the"

19,106,18,"And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked."
19,106,19,"They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image."
19,106,20,"Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass."
19,106,21,"They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;"
19,106,22,"Wondrous works in the land of Ham,  and  terrible things by the Red sea."
19,106,23,"Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy  them ."
19,106,24,"Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:"
19,106,25,"But murmured in their tents,  and  hearkened not unto the voice of the"
19,106,26,"Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:"
19,106,27,"To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands."
19,106,28,"They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead."
19,106,29,"Thus they provoked  him  to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them."
19,106,30,"Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and  so  the plague was stayed."
19,106,31,"And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore."
19,106,32,"They angered  him  also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:"
19,106,33,"Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips."
19,106,34,"They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the"
19,106,35,"But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works."
19,106,36,"And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them."
19,106,37,"Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,"
19,106,38,"And shed innocent blood,  even  the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood."
19,106,39,"Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions."
19,106,40,"Therefore was the wrath of the"
19,106,41,"And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them."
19,106,42,"Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand."
19,106,43,"Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked  him  with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity."
19,106,44,"Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:"
19,106,45,"And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies."
19,106,46,"He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives."

19,107,4,"They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in."
19,107,5,"Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them."
19,107,6,"Then they cried unto the"

19,107,10,"Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,  being  bound in affliction and iron;"
19,107,11,"Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:"
19,107,12,"Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and  there was  none to help."
19,107,13,"Then they cried unto the"
19,107,14,"He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder."
19,107,15,"Oh that  men  would praise the"
19,107,16,"For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder."
19,107,17,"Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted."
19,107,18,"Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death."
19,107,19,"Then they cry unto the"

19,107,26,"They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble."
19,107,27,"They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end."
19,107,28,"Then they cry unto the"
19,107,29,"He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still."
19,107,30,"Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven."
19,107,31,"Oh that  men  would praise the"

19,107,33,"He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;"
19,107,34,"A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein."
19,107,35,"He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings."
19,107,36,"And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;"
19,107,37,"And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase."
19,107,38,"He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease."
19,107,39,"Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow."

20,6,22,"When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and  when  thou awakest, it shall talk with thee."
20,6,23,"For the commandment  is  a lamp; and the law  is  light; and reproofs of instruction  are  the way of life:"

21,1,1,"The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem."
21,1,2,"Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all  is  vanity."
21,1,3,"What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?"
21,1,4,"One  generation passeth away, and  another  generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever."
21,1,5,"The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose."

21,1,8,"All things  are  full of labour; man cannot utter  it : the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing."
21,1,9,"The thing that hath been, it  is that  which shall be; and that which is done  is  that which shall be done: and  there is  no new  thing  under the sun."
21,1,10,"Is there  any  thing whereof it may be said, See, this  is  new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us."
21,1,11,"There is  no remembrance of former  things ; neither shall there be  any  remembrance of  things  that are to come with  those  that shall come after."
21,1,12,"I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem."
21,1,13,"And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all  things  that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith."
21,1,14,"I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all  is  vanity and vexation of spirit."
21,1,15,"That which is  crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered."
21,1,16,"I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all  they  that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."
21,1,17,"And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit."
21,1,18,"For in much wisdom  is  much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow."
21,2,1,"I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also  is  vanity."
21,2,2,"I said of laughter,  It is  mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?"
21,2,3,"I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what  was  that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life."
21,2,4,"I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:"
21,2,5,"I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all  kind of  fruits:"
21,2,6,"I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:"
21,2,7,"I got  me  servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:"
21,2,8,"I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men,  as  musical instruments, and that of all sorts."
21,2,9,"So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me."
21,2,10,"And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour."
21,2,11,"Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all  was  vanity and vexation of spirit, and  there was  no profit under the sun."
21,2,12,"And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what  can  the man  do  that cometh after the king?  even  that which hath been already done."
21,2,13,"Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness."
21,2,14,"The wise man’s eyes  are  in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all."
21,2,15,"Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also  is  vanity."
21,2,16,"For  there is  no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now  is  in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise  man ? as the fool."
21,2,17,"Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun  is  grievous unto me: for all  is  vanity and vexation of spirit."
21,2,18,"Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me."
21,2,19,"And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise  man  or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This  is  also vanity."
21,2,20,"Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun."
21,2,21,"For there is a man whose labour  is  in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it  for  his portion. This also  is  vanity and a great evil."
21,2,22,"For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?"
21,2,23,"For all his days  are  sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity."
21,2,24,"There is  nothing better for a man,  than  that he should eat and drink, and  that  he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it  was  from the hand of God."
21,2,25,"For who can eat, or who else can hasten  hereunto , more than I?"
21,2,26,"For  God  giveth to a man that  is  good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to  him that is  good before God. This also  is  vanity and vexation of spirit."
21,3,1,"To every  thing there is  a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:"
21,3,2,"A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up  that which is  planted;"
21,3,3,"A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;"
21,3,4,"A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;"
21,3,5,"A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;"
21,3,6,"A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;"
21,3,7,"A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;"
21,3,8,"A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace."
21,3,9,"What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?"
21,3,10,"I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it."
21,3,11,"He hath made every  thing  beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end."
21,3,12,"I know that  there is  no good in them, but for  a man  to rejoice, and to do good in his life."
21,3,13,"And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it  is  the gift of God."
21,3,14,"I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth  it , that  men  should fear before him."
21,3,15,"That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past."
21,3,16,"And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment,  that  wickedness  was  there; and the place of righteousness,  that  iniquity  was  there."
21,3,17,"I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for  there is  a time there for every purpose and for every work."
21,3,18,"I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts."
21,3,19,"For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all  is  vanity."
21,3,20,"All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again."
21,3,21,"Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?"
21,3,22,"Wherefore I perceive that  there is  nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that  is  his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?"
21,4,1,"So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of  such as were  oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors  there was  power; but they had no comforter."
21,4,2,"Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive."
21,4,3,"Yea, better  is he  than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun."
21,4,4,"Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This  is  also vanity and vexation of spirit."
21,4,5,"The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh."
21,4,6,"Better  is  an handful  with  quietness, than both the hands full  with  travail and vexation of spirit."
21,4,7,"Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun."
21,4,8,"There is one  alone , and  there is  not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet  is there  no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither  saith he , For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This  is  also vanity, yea, it  is  a sore travail."
21,4,9,"Two  are  better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour."
21,4,10,"For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him  that is  alone when he falleth; for  he hath  not another to help him up."
21,4,11,"Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm  alone ?"
21,4,12,"And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken."
21,4,13,"Better  is  a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished."
21,4,14,"For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also  he that is  born in his kingdom becometh poor."
21,4,15,"I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead."
21,4,16,"There is  no end of all the people,  even  of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also  is  vanity and vexation of spirit."
21,5,1,"Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil."
21,5,2,"Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter  any  thing before God: for God  is  in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few."
21,5,3,"For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice  is known  by multitude of words."
21,5,4,"When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for  he hath  no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed."
21,5,5,"Better  is it  that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay."
21,5,6,"Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it  was  an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?"
21,5,7,"For in the multitude of dreams and many words  there are  also  divers  vanities: but fear thou God."
21,5,8,"If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for  he that is  higher than the highest regardeth; and  there be  higher than they."
21,5,9,"Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king  himself  is served by the field."
21,5,10,"He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this  is  also vanity."
21,5,11,"When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good  is there  to the owners thereof, saving the beholding  of them  with their eyes?"
21,5,12,"The sleep of a labouring man  is  sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep."
21,5,13,"There is a sore evil  which  I have seen under the sun,  namely , riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt."
21,5,14,"But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and  there is  nothing in his hand."
21,5,15,"As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand."
21,5,16,"And this also  is  a sore evil,  that  in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?"
21,5,17,"All his days also he eateth in darkness, and  he hath  much sorrow and wrath with his sickness."
21,5,18,"Behold  that  which I have seen:  it is  good and comely  for one  to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it  is  his portion."
21,5,19,"Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this  is  the gift of God."
21,5,20,"For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth  him  in the joy of his heart."
21,6,1,"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it  is  common among men:"
21,6,2,"A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this  is  vanity, and it  is  an evil disease."
21,6,3,"If a man beget an hundred  children , and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also  that  he have no burial; I say,  that  an untimely birth  is  better than he."
21,6,4,"For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness."
21,6,5,"Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known  any thing : this hath more rest than the other."
21,6,6,"Yea, though he live a thousand years twice  told , yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?"
21,6,7,"All the labour of man  is  for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled."
21,6,8,"For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?"
21,6,9,"Better  is  the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this  is  also vanity and vexation of spirit."
21,6,10,"That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it  is  man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he."
21,6,11,"Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what  is  man the better?"
21,6,12,"For who knoweth what  is  good for man in  this  life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?"
21,7,1,"A good name  is  better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth."
21,7,2,"It is  better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that  is  the end of all men; and the living will lay  it  to his heart."
21,7,3,"Sorrow  is  better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better."
21,7,4,"The heart of the wise  is  in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools  is  in the house of mirth."
21,7,5,"It is  better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools."
21,7,6,"For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so  is  the laughter of the fool: this also  is  vanity."
21,7,7,"Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart."
21,7,8,"Better  is  the end of a thing than the beginning thereof:  and  the patient in spirit  is  better than the proud in spirit."
21,7,9,"Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools."
21,7,10,"Say not thou, What is  the cause  that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this."
21,7,11,"Wisdom  is  good with an inheritance: and  by it there is  profit to them that see the sun."
21,7,12,"For wisdom  is  a defence,  and  money  is  a defence: but the excellency of knowledge  is, that  wisdom giveth life to them that have it."
21,7,13,"Consider the work of God: for who can make  that  straight, which he hath made crooked?"
21,7,14,"In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him."
21,7,15,"All  things  have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just  man  that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked  man  that prolongeth  his life  in his wickedness."
21,7,16,"Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?"
21,7,17,"Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?"
21,7,18,"It is  good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all."
21,7,19,"Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty  men  which are in the city."
21,7,20,"For  there is  not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not."
21,7,21,"Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:"
21,7,22,"For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others."
21,7,23,"All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it  was  far from me."
21,7,24,"That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"
21,7,25,"I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason  of things , and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness  and  madness:"
21,7,26,"And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart  is  snares and nets,  and  her hands  as  bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her."
21,7,27,"Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher,  counting  one by one, to find out the account:"
21,7,28,"Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found."
21,7,29,"Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions."
21,8,1,"Who  is  as the wise  man ? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed."
21,8,2,"I  counsel thee  to keep the king’s commandment, and  that  in regard of the oath of God."
21,8,3,"Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him."
21,8,4,"Where the word of a king  is, there is  power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?"
21,8,5,"Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment."
21,8,6,"Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man  is  great upon him."
21,8,7,"For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?"
21,8,8,"There is  no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither  hath he  power in the day of death: and  there is  no discharge in  that  war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it."
21,8,9,"All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun:  there is  a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt."
21,8,10,"And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this  is  also vanity."
21,8,11,"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil."
21,8,12,"Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his  days  be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:"
21,8,13,"But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong  his  days,  which are  as a shadow; because he feareth not before God."
21,8,14,"There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just  men , unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked  men , to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also  is  vanity."
21,8,15,"Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun."
21,8,16,"When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also  there is that  neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)"
21,8,17,"Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek  it  out, yet he shall not find  it ; yea further; though a wise  man  think to know  it , yet shall he not be able to find  it ."
21,9,1,"For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works,  are  in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred  by  all  that is  before them."
21,9,2,"All  things come  alike to all:  there is  one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as  is  the good, so  is  the sinner;  and  he that sweareth, as  he  that feareth an oath."
21,9,3,"This  is  an evil among all  things  that are done under the sun, that  there is  one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness  is  in their heart while they live, and after that  they go  to the dead."
21,9,4,"For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion."
21,9,5,"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten."
21,9,6,"Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any  thing  that is done under the sun."
21,9,7,"Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works."
21,9,8,"Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment."
21,9,9,"Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that  is  thy portion in  this  life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun."
21,9,10,"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do  it  with thy might; for  there is  no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest."
21,9,11,"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race  is  not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all."
21,9,12,"For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so  are  the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them."
21,9,13,"This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it  seemed  great unto me:"
21,9,14,"There was  a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:"
21,9,15,"Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man."
21,9,16,"Then said I, Wisdom  is  better than strength: nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom  is  despised, and his words are not heard."
21,9,17,"The words of wise  men are  heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools."
21,9,18,"Wisdom  is  better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good."
21,10,1,"Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour:  so doth  a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom  and  honour."
21,10,2,"A wise man’s heart  is  at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left."
21,10,3,"Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth  him , and he saith to every one  that  he  is  a fool."
21,10,4,"If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences."
21,10,5,"There is an evil  which  I have seen under the sun, as an error  which  proceedeth from the ruler:"
21,10,6,"Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place."
21,10,7,"I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth."
21,10,8,"He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him."
21,10,9,"Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith;  and  he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby."
21,10,10,"If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom  is  profitable to direct."
21,10,11,"Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better."
21,10,12,"The words of a wise man’s mouth  are  gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself."
21,10,13,"The beginning of the words of his mouth  is  foolishness: and the end of his talk  is  mischievous madness."
21,10,14,"A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?"
21,10,15,"The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city."
21,10,16,"Woe to thee, O land, when thy king  is  a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!"
21,10,17,"Blessed  art  thou, O land, when thy king  is  the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!"
21,10,18,"By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through."
21,10,19,"A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all  things ."
21,10,20,"Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter."
21,11,1,"Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days."
21,11,2,"Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth."
21,11,3,"If the clouds be full of rain, they empty  themselves  upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be."
21,11,4,"He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap."
21,11,5,"As thou knowest not what  is  the way of the spirit,  nor  how the bones  do grow  in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all."
21,11,6,"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both  shall be  alike good."
21,11,7,"Truly the light  is  sweet, and a pleasant  thing it is  for the eyes to behold the sun:"
21,11,8,"But if a man live many years,  and  rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh  is  vanity."
21,11,9,"Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these  things  God will bring thee into judgment."
21,11,10,"Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth  are  vanity."
21,12,1,"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;"
21,12,2,"While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:"
21,12,3,"In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,"
21,12,4,"And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;"
21,12,5,"Also  when  they shall be afraid of  that which is  high, and fears  shall be  in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:"
21,12,6,"Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern."
21,12,7,"Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it."
21,12,8,"Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all  is  vanity."
21,12,9,"And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out,  and  set in order many proverbs."
21,12,10,"The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and  that which was  written  was  upright,  even  words of truth."
21,12,11,"The words of the wise  are  as goads, and as nails fastened  by  the masters of assemblies,  which  are given from one shepherd."
21,12,12,"And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books  there is  no end; and much study  is  a weariness of the flesh."
21,12,13,"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this  is  the whole  duty  of man."
21,12,14,"For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether  it be  good, or whether  it be  evil."
22,1,1,"The song of songs, which  is  Solomon’s."
22,1,2,"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love  is  better than wine."
22,1,3,"Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name  is as  ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee."
22,1,4,"Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee."
22,1,5,"I  am  black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon."
22,1,6,"Look not upon me, because I  am  black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother’s children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards;  but  mine own vineyard have I not kept."
22,1,7,"Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest  thy flock  to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?"
22,1,8,"If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents."
22,1,9,"I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots."
22,1,10,"Thy cheeks are comely with rows  of jewels , thy neck with chains  of gold ."
22,1,11,"We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver."
22,1,12,"While the king  sitteth  at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof."
22,1,13,"A bundle of myrrh  is  my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts."
22,1,14,"My beloved  is  unto me  as  a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi."
22,1,15,"Behold, thou  art  fair, my love; behold, thou  art  fair; thou  hast  doves’ eyes."
22,1,16,"Behold, thou  art  fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed  is  green."
22,1,17,"The beams of our house  are  cedar,  and  our rafters of fir."
22,2,1,"I  am  the rose of Sharon,  and  the lily of the valleys."
22,2,2,"As the lily among thorns, so  is  my love among the daughters."
22,2,3,"As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so  is  my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit  was  sweet to my taste."
22,2,4,"He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me  was  love."
22,2,5,"Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I  am  sick of love."
22,2,6,"His left hand  is  under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me."
22,2,7,"I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake  my  love, till he please."
22,2,8,"The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills."
22,2,9,"My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice."
22,2,10,"My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away."
22,2,11,"For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over  and  gone;"
22,2,12,"The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing  of birds  is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;"
22,2,13,"The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines  with  the tender grape give a  good  smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away."
22,2,14,"O my dove,  that art  in the clefts of the rock, in the secret  places  of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet  is  thy voice, and thy countenance  is  comely."
22,2,15,"Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines  have  tender grapes."
22,2,16,"My beloved  is  mine, and I  am  his: he feedeth among the lilies."
22,2,17,"Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether."
22,3,1,"By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not."
22,3,2,"I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not."
22,3,3,"The watchmen that go about the city found me:  to whom I said , Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?"
22,3,4,"It was  but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me."
22,3,5,"I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake  my  love, till he please."
22,3,6,"Who  is  this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?"
22,3,7,"Behold his bed, which  is  Solomon’s; threescore valiant men  are  about it, of the valiant of Israel."
22,3,8,"They all hold swords,  being  expert in war: every man  hath  his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night."
22,3,9,"King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon."
22,3,10,"He made the pillars thereof  of  silver, the bottom thereof  of  gold, the covering of it  of  purple, the midst thereof being paved  with  love, for the daughters of Jerusalem."
22,3,11,"Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart."
22,4,1,"Behold, thou  art  fair, my love; behold, thou  art  fair; thou  hast  doves’ eyes within thy locks: thy hair  is  as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead."
22,4,2,"Thy teeth  are  like a flock  of sheep that are even  shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none  is  barren among them."
22,4,3,"Thy lips  are  like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech  is  comely: thy temples  are  like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks."
22,4,4,"Thy neck  is  like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men."
22,4,5,"Thy two breasts  are  like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies."
22,4,6,"Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense."
22,4,7,"Thou  art  all fair, my love;  there is  no spot in thee."
22,4,8,"Come with me from Lebanon,  my  spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards."
22,4,9,"Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister,  my  spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck."
22,4,10,"How fair is thy love, my sister,  my  spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!"
22,4,11,"Thy lips, O  my  spouse, drop  as  the honeycomb: honey and milk  are  under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments  is  like the smell of Lebanon."
22,4,12,"A garden inclosed  is  my sister,  my  spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed."
22,4,13,"Thy plants  are  an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,"
22,4,14,"Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:"
22,4,15,"A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon."
22,4,16,"Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden,  that  the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits."
22,5,1,"I am come into my garden, my sister,  my  spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved."
22,5,2,"I sleep, but my heart waketh:  it is  the voice of my beloved that knocketh,  saying , Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew,  and  my locks with the drops of the night."
22,5,3,"I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?"
22,5,4,"My beloved put in his hand by the hole  of the door , and my bowels were moved for him."
22,5,5,"I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped  with  myrrh, and my fingers  with  sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock."
22,5,6,"I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself,  and  was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer."
22,5,7,"The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me."
22,5,8,"I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I  am  sick of love."
22,5,9,"What  is  thy beloved more than  another  beloved, O thou fairest among women? what  is  thy beloved more than  another  beloved, that thou dost so charge us?"
22,5,10,"My beloved  is  white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand."
22,5,11,"His head  is as  the most fine gold, his locks  are  bushy,  and  black as a raven."
22,5,12,"His eyes  are  as  the eyes  of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk,  and  fitly set."
22,5,13,"His cheeks  are  as a bed of spices,  as  sweet flowers: his lips  like  lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh."
22,5,14,"His hands  are as  gold rings set with the beryl: his belly  is as  bright ivory overlaid  with  sapphires."
22,5,15,"His legs  are as  pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance  is  as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars."
22,5,16,"His mouth  is  most sweet: yea, he  is  altogether lovely. This  is  my beloved, and this  is  my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem."
22,6,1,"Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee."
22,6,2,"My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies."
22,6,3,"I  am  my beloved’s, and my beloved  is  mine: he feedeth among the lilies."
22,6,4,"Thou  art  beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as  an army  with banners."
22,6,5,"Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair  is  as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead."
22,6,6,"Thy teeth  are  as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and  there is  not one barren among them."
22,6,7,"As a piece of a pomegranate  are  thy temples within thy locks."

23,10,16,"Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire."
23,10,17,"And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;"

23,22,22,"And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open."

23,23,2,"Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished."
23,23,3,"And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river,  is  her revenue; and she is a mart of nations."
23,23,4,"Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken,  even  the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men,  nor  bring up virgins."
23,23,5,"As at the report concerning Egypt,  so  shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre."
23,23,6,"Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle."

23,24,17,"Fear, and the pit, and the snare,  are  upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth."
23,24,18,"And it shall come to pass,  that  he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake."
23,24,19,"The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly."

23,36,12,"But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words?  hath he  not  sent me  to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?"
23,36,13,"Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria."

23,37,25,"I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places."
23,37,26,"Hast thou not heard long ago,  how  I have done it;  and  of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities  into  ruinous heaps."
23,37,27,"Therefore their inhabitants  were  of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were  as  the grass of the field, and  as  the green herb,  as  the grass on the housetops, and  as corn  blasted before it be grown up."

23,40,9,"O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift  it  up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!"
23,40,10,"Behold, the Lord"
23,40,11,"He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry  them  in his bosom,  and  shall gently lead those that are with young."
23,40,12,"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?"
23,40,13,"Who hath directed the Spirit of the"

23,40,15,"Behold, the nations  are  as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing."
23,40,16,"And Lebanon  is  not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering."
23,40,17,"All nations before him  are  as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity."
23,40,18,"To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?"
23,40,19,"The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains."
23,40,20,"He that  is  so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree  that  will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image,  that  shall not be moved."
23,40,21,"Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?"
23,40,22,"It is  he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof  are  as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:"
23,40,23,"That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity."
23,40,24,"Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble."
23,40,25,"To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One."
23,40,26,"Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these  things , that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that  he is  strong in power; not one faileth."
23,40,27,"Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the"

23,41,2,"Who raised up the righteous  man  from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made  him  rule over kings? he gave  them  as the dust to his sword,  and  as driven stubble to his bow."
23,41,3,"He pursued them,  and  passed safely;  even  by the way  that  he had not gone with his feet."
23,41,4,"Who hath wrought and done  it , calling the generations from the beginning? I the"
23,41,5,"The isles saw  it , and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came."
23,41,6,"They helped every one his neighbour; and  every one  said to his brother, Be of good courage."
23,41,7,"So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith,  and  he that smootheth  with  the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It  is  ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails,  that  it should not be moved."
23,41,8,"But thou, Israel,  art  my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend."
23,41,9,"Thou  whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou  art  my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away."

23,41,11,"Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish."
23,41,12,"Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them,  even  them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought."
23,41,13,"For I the"
23,41,14,"Fear not, thou worm Jacob,  and  ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the"
23,41,15,"Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat  them  small, and shalt make the hills as chaff."

23,41,19,"I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree,  and  the pine, and the box tree together:"
23,41,20,"That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the"

23,41,22,"Let them bring  them  forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they  be , that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come."
23,41,23,"Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye  are  gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold  it  together."
23,41,24,"Behold, ye  are  of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination  is he that  chooseth you."
23,41,25,"I have raised up  one  from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as  upon  morter, and as the potter treadeth clay."
23,41,26,"Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say,  He is  righteous? yea,  there is  none that sheweth, yea,  there is  none that declareth, yea,  there is  none that heareth your words."
23,41,27,"The first  shall say  to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings."
23,41,28,"For I beheld, and  there was  no man; even among them, and  there was  no counseller, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word."
23,41,29,"Behold, they  are  all vanity; their works  are  nothing: their molten images  are  wind and confusion."
23,42,1,"Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect,  in whom  my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles."
23,42,2,"He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street."
23,42,3,"A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth."
23,42,4,"He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law."

23,43,8,"Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears."
23,43,9,"Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say,  It is  truth."

23,48,6,"Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare  it ? I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them."
23,48,7,"They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them."
23,48,8,"Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time  that  thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb."
23,48,9,"For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off."
23,48,10,"Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction."
23,48,11,"For mine own sake,  even  for mine own sake, will I do  it : for how should  my name  be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another."
23,48,12,"Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I  am  he; I  am  the first, I also  am  the last."
23,48,13,"Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens:  when  I call unto them, they stand up together."
23,48,14,"All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these  things ? The"
23,48,15,"I,  even  I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous."
23,48,16,"Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there  am  I: and now the Lord"
23,48,17,"Thus saith the"
23,48,18,"O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:"
23,48,19,"Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me."
23,48,20,"Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it  even  to the end of the earth; say ye, The"

23,49,3,"And said unto me, Thou  art  my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified."
23,49,4,"Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain:  yet  surely my judgment  is  with the"
23,49,5,"And now, saith the"
23,49,6,"And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth."
23,49,7,"Thus saith the"
23,49,8,"Thus saith the"
23,49,9,"That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that  are  in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures  shall be  in all high places."
23,49,10,"They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them."
23,49,11,"And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted."
23,49,12,"Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim."
23,49,13,"Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the"

23,49,17,"Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee."
23,49,18,"Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together,  and  come to thee.  As  I live, saith the"
23,49,19,"For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away."
23,49,20,"The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place  is  too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell."
23,49,21,"Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where  had  they  been ?"
23,49,22,"Thus saith the Lord"

23,50,2,"Wherefore, when I came,  was there  no man? when I called,  was there  none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because  there is  no water, and dieth for thirst."
23,50,3,"I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering."
23,50,4,"The Lord"
23,50,5,"The Lord"
23,50,6,"I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting."

23,51,6,"Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished."
23,51,7,"Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart  is  my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings."

23,53,3,"He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were  our  faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not."
23,53,4,"Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted."
23,53,5,"But he  was  wounded for our transgressions,  he was  bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon him; and with his stripes we are healed."
23,53,6,"All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the"

23,53,8,"He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken."
23,53,9,"And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither  was any  deceit in his mouth."

23,53,12,"Therefore will I divide him  a portion  with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors."
23,54,1,"Sing, O barren, thou  that  didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou  that  didst not travail with child: for more  are  the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the"

23,57,16,"For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls  which  I have made."
23,57,17,"For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart."
23,57,18,"I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners."
23,57,19,"I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to  him that is  far off, and to  him that is  near, saith the"

23,59,4,"None calleth for justice, nor  any  pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity."
23,59,5,"They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper."
23,59,6,"Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works  are  works of iniquity, and the act of violence  is  in their hands."
23,59,7,"Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts  are  thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction  are  in their paths."
23,59,8,"The way of peace they know not; and  there is  no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace."
23,59,9,"Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness,  but  we walk in darkness."
23,59,10,"We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if  we had  no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night;  we are  in desolate places as dead  men ."
23,59,11,"We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but  there is  none; for salvation,  but  it is far off from us."
23,59,12,"For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions  are  with us; and  as for  our iniquities, we know them;"

Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations."
23,66,4,"I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose  that  in which I delighted not."

24,3,21,"A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping  and  supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way,  and  they have forgotten the"

24,4,6,"Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction."
24,4,7,"The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate;  and  thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant."
24,4,8,"For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the"
24,4,9,"And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the"
24,4,10,"Then said I, Ah, Lord"
24,4,11,"At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,"
24,4,12,"Even  a full wind from those  places  shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them."
24,4,13,"Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots  shall be  as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled."
24,4,14,"O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?"
24,4,15,"For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim."
24,4,16,"Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem,  that  watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah."
24,4,17,"As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the"
24,4,18,"Thy way and thy doings have procured these  things  unto thee; this  is  thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart."
24,4,19,"My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war."
24,4,20,"Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled,  and  my curtains in a moment."
24,4,21,"How long shall I see the standard,  and  hear the sound of the trumpet?"
24,4,22,"For my people  is  foolish, they have not known me; they  are  sottish children, and they have none understanding: they  are  wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge."
24,4,23,"I beheld the earth, and, lo,  it was  without form, and void; and the heavens, and they  had  no light."
24,4,24,"I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly."
24,4,25,"I beheld, and, lo,  there was  no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled."
24,4,26,"I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place  was  a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the"
24,4,27,"For thus hath the"
24,4,28,"For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken  it , I have purposed  it , and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it."
24,4,29,"The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city  shall be  forsaken, and not a man dwell therein."
24,4,30,"And  when  thou  art  spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair;  thy  lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life."
24,4,31,"For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail,  and  the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion,  that  bewaileth herself,  that  spreadeth her hands,  saying , Woe  is  me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers."
24,5,1,"Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be  any  that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it."
24,5,2,"And though they say, The"

24,5,6,"Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them,  and  a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many,  and  their backslidings are increased."
24,5,7,"How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by  them that are  no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots’ houses."
24,5,8,"They were  as  fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour’s wife."
24,5,9,"Shall I not visit for these  things ? saith the"
24,5,10,"Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they  are  not the"
24,5,11,"For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the"
24,5,12,"They have belied the"

24,5,14,"Wherefore thus saith the"
24,5,15,"Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the"
24,5,16,"Their quiver  is  as an open sepulchre, they  are  all mighty men."
24,5,17,"And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread,  which  thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword."
24,5,18,"Nevertheless in those days, saith the"
24,5,19,"And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the"
24,5,20,"Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,"
24,5,21,"Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:"
24,5,22,"Fear ye not me? saith the"
24,5,23,"But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone."
24,5,24,"Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the"
24,5,25,"Your iniquities have turned away these  things , and your sins have withholden good  things  from you."
24,5,26,"For among my people are found wicked  men : they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men."
24,5,27,"As a cage is full of birds, so  are  their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich."
24,5,28,"They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge."
24,5,29,"Shall I not visit for these  things ? saith the"
24,5,30,"A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;"
24,5,31,"The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love  to have it  so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?"
24,6,1,"O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction."
24,6,2,"I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate  woman ."
24,6,3,"The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch  their  tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place."
24,6,4,"Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out."
24,6,5,"Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces."
24,6,6,"For thus hath the"
24,6,7,"As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually  is  grief and wounds."
24,6,8,"Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited."
24,6,9,"Thus saith the"
24,6,10,"To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear  is  uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the"

24,6,14,"They have healed also the hurt  of the daughter  of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when  there is  no peace."
24,6,15,"Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time  that  I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the"
24,6,16,"Thus saith the"
24,6,17,"Also I set watchmen over you,  saying , Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken."
24,6,18,"Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what  is  among them."
24,6,19,"Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people,  even  the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it."
24,6,20,"To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings  are  not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me."
24,6,21,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,6,22,"Thus saith the"

24,6,24,"We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us,  and  pain, as of a woman in travail."
24,6,25,"Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy  and  fear  is  on every side."
24,6,26,"O daughter of my people, gird  thee  with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning,  as for  an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us."
24,6,27,"I have set thee  for  a tower  and  a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way."
24,6,28,"They  are  all grievous revolters, walking with slanders:  they are  brass and iron; they  are  all corrupters."
24,6,29,"The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away."

24,7,6,"If  ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:"
24,7,7,"Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever."
24,7,8,"Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit."
24,7,9,"Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not;"
24,7,10,"And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?"
24,7,11,"Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen  it , saith the"
24,7,12,"But go ye now unto my place which  was  in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel."
24,7,13,"And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the"
24,7,14,"Therefore will I do unto  this  house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh."
24,7,15,"And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren,  even  the whole seed of Ephraim."
24,7,16,"Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee."
24,7,17,"Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
24,7,18,"The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead  their  dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger."
24,7,19,"Do they provoke me to anger? saith the"
24,7,20,"Therefore thus saith the Lord"
24,7,21,"Thus saith the"
24,7,22,"For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:"
24,7,23,"But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you."
24,7,24,"But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels  and  in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward."
24,7,25,"Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending  them :"
24,7,26,"Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers."
24,7,27,"Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee."
24,7,28,"But thou shalt say unto them, This  is  a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the"

24,7,32,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the"
24,7,33,"And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray  them  away."
24,7,34,"Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate."
24,8,1,"At that time, saith the"
24,8,2,"And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth."
24,8,3,"And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the"
24,8,4,"Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the"

24,8,6,"I hearkened and heard,  but  they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle."
24,8,7,"Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the"
24,8,8,"How do ye say, We  are  wise, and the law of the"
24,8,9,"The wise  men  are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the"
24,8,10,"Therefore will I give their wives unto others,  and  their fields to them that shall inherit  them : for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely."
24,8,11,"For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when  there is  no peace."
24,8,12,"Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the"
24,8,13,"I will surely consume them, saith the"
24,8,14,"Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the"
24,8,15,"We looked for peace, but no good  came; and  for a time of health, and behold trouble!"
24,8,16,"The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein."
24,8,17,"For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which  will  not  be  charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the"
24,8,18,"When  I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart  is  faint in me."
24,8,19,"Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country:  Is  not the"
24,8,20,"The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved."
24,8,21,"For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me."
24,8,22,"Is there  no balm in Gilead;  is there  no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?"
24,9,1,"Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!"
24,9,2,"Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they  be  all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men."
24,9,3,"And they bend their tongues  like  their bow  for  lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the"
24,9,4,"Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders."
24,9,5,"And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies,  and  weary themselves to commit iniquity."
24,9,6,"Thine habitation  is  in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the"
24,9,7,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,9,8,"Their tongue  is as  an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit:  one  speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait."
24,9,9,"Shall I not visit them for these  things ? saith the"
24,9,10,"For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through  them ; neither can  men  hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone."
24,9,11,"And I will make Jerusalem heaps,  and  a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant."
24,9,12,"Who  is  the wise man, that may understand this? and  who is he  to whom the mouth of the"

24,9,15,"Therefore thus saith the"

24,9,17,"Thus saith the"
24,9,18,"And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters."
24,9,19,"For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast  us  out."
24,9,20,"Yet hear the word of the"
24,9,21,"For death is come up into our windows,  and  is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without,  and  the young men from the streets."

24,10,1,"Hear ye the word which the"
24,10,2,"Thus saith the"
24,10,3,"For the customs of the people  are  vain: for  one  cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe."
24,10,4,"They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not."
24,10,5,"They  are  upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also  is it  in them to do good."
24,10,6,"Forasmuch as  there is  none like unto thee, O"
24,10,7,"Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise  men  of the nations, and in all their kingdoms,  there is  none like unto thee."
24,10,8,"But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock  is  a doctrine of vanities."
24,10,9,"Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple  is  their clothing: they  are  all the work of cunning  men ."
24,10,10,"But the"
24,10,11,"Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth,  even  they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens."
24,10,12,"He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion."
24,10,13,"When he uttereth his voice,  there is  a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures."
24,10,14,"Every man is brutish in  his  knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image  is  falsehood, and  there is  no breath in them."
24,10,15,"They  are  vanity,  and  the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish."
24,10,16,"The portion of Jacob  is  not like them: for he  is  the former of all  things ; and Israel  is  the rod of his inheritance: The"

24,11,8,"Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded  them  to do; but they did  them  not."
24,11,9,"And the"
24,11,10,"They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers."
24,11,11,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,11,12,"Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble."
24,11,13,"For  according to  the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and  according to  the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to  that  shameful thing,  even  altars to burn incense unto Baal."
24,11,14,"Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear  them  in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble."
24,11,15,"What hath my beloved to do in mine house,  seeing  she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest."
24,11,16,"The"
24,11,17,"For the"
24,11,18,"And the"
24,11,19,"But I  was  like a lamb  or  an ox  that  is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me,  saying , Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered."
24,11,20,"But, O"
24,11,21,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,11,22,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,11,23,"And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth,  even  the year of their visitation."
24,12,1,"Righteous  art  thou, O"
24,12,2,"Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou  art  near in their mouth, and far from their reins."
24,12,3,"But thou, O"
24,12,4,"How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end."
24,12,5,"If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and  if  in the land of peace,  wherein  thou trustedst,  they wearied thee , then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?"
24,12,6,"For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee."
24,12,7,"I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies."
24,12,8,"Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it."
24,12,9,"Mine heritage  is  unto me  as  a speckled bird, the birds round about  are  against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour."
24,12,10,"Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness."
24,12,11,"They have made it desolate,  and being  desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth  it  to heart."
24,12,12,"The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the"
24,12,13,"They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain,  but  shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the"
24,12,14,"Thus saith the"
24,12,15,"And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land."
24,12,16,"And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The"
24,12,17,"But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the"
24,13,1,"Thus saith the"
24,13,2,"So I got a girdle according to the word of the"
24,13,3,"And the word of the"
24,13,4,"Take the girdle that thou hast got, which  is  upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock."
24,13,5,"So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the"
24,13,6,"And it came to pass after many days, that the"
24,13,7,"Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing."
24,13,8,"Then the word of the"
24,13,9,"Thus saith the"
24,13,10,"This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing."
24,13,11,"For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the"
24,13,12,"Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the"
24,13,13,"Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the"
24,13,14,"And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the"
24,13,15,"Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the"
24,13,16,"Give glory to the"
24,13,17,"But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for  your  pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the"
24,13,18,"Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down,  even  the crown of your glory."
24,13,19,"The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open  them : Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive."
24,13,20,"Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where  is  the flock  that  was given thee, thy beautiful flock?"
24,13,21,"What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them  to be  captains,  and  as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?"
24,13,22,"And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered,  and  thy heels made bare."
24,13,23,"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?  then  may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil."
24,13,24,"Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness."
24,13,25,"This  is  thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the"
24,13,26,"Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear."
24,13,27,"I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom,  and  thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when  shall it  once  be ?"
24,14,1,"The word of the"
24,14,2,"Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up."
24,14,3,"And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits,  and  found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads."
24,14,4,"Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads."
24,14,5,"Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook  it , because there was no grass."
24,14,6,"And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because  there was  no grass."
24,14,7,"O"
24,14,8,"O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man  that  turneth aside to tarry for a night?"
24,14,9,"Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man  that  cannot save? yet thou, O"
24,14,10,"Thus saith the"
24,14,11,"Then said the"
24,14,12,"When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence."
24,14,13,"Then said I, Ah, Lord"
24,14,14,"Then the"
24,14,15,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,14,16,"And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them."
24,14,17,"Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow."
24,14,18,"If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not."
24,14,19,"Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and  there is  no healing for us? we looked for peace, and  there is  no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!"
24,14,20,"We acknowledge, O"
24,14,21,"Do not abhor  us , for thy name’s sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us."
24,14,22,"Are there  any  among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers?  art  not thou he, O"
24,15,1,"Then said the"
24,15,2,"And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the"
24,15,3,"And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the"
24,15,4,"And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for  that  which he did in Jerusalem."
24,15,5,"For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?"
24,15,6,"Thou hast forsaken me, saith the"
24,15,7,"And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave  them  of children, I will destroy my people,  since  they return not from their ways."
24,15,8,"Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused  him  to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city."
24,15,9,"She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while  it was  yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the"
24,15,10,"Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury;  yet  every one of them doth curse me."
24,15,11,"The"
24,15,12,"Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?"
24,15,13,"Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and  that  for all thy sins, even in all thy borders."
24,15,14,"And I will make  thee  to pass with thine enemies into a land  which  thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger,  which  shall burn upon you."
24,15,15,"O"
24,15,16,"Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O"
24,15,17,"I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation."
24,15,18,"Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable,  which  refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar,  and as  waters  that  fail?"
24,15,19,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,15,20,"And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I  am  with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the"
24,15,21,"And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible."
24,16,1,"The word of the"
24,16,2,"Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place."
24,16,3,"For thus saith the"
24,16,4,"They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried;  but  they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth."
24,16,5,"For thus saith the"
24,16,6,"Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall  men  lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:"
24,16,7,"Neither shall  men  tear  themselves  for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall  men  give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother."
24,16,8,"Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink."
24,16,9,"For thus saith the"
24,16,10,"And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the"
24,16,11,"Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the"
24,16,12,"And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:"
24,16,13,"Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not,  neither  ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour."
24,16,14,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the"
24,16,15,"But, The"
24,16,16,"Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the"
24,16,17,"For mine eyes  are  upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes."
24,16,18,"And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things."
24,16,19,"O"
24,16,20,"Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they  are  no gods?"

24,17,1,"The sin of Judah  is  written with a pen of iron,  and  with the point of a diamond:  it is  graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;"
24,17,2,"Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills."
24,17,3,"O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance  and  all thy treasures to the spoil,  and  thy high places for sin, throughout all thy borders."
24,17,4,"And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger,  which  shall burn for ever."
24,17,5,"Thus saith the"
24,17,6,"For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,  in  a salt land and not inhabited."
24,17,7,"Blessed  is  the man that trusteth in the"
24,17,8,"For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and  that  spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit."
24,17,9,"The heart  is  deceitful above all  things , and desperately wicked: who can know it?"
24,17,10,"I the"

24,17,12,"A glorious high throne from the beginning  is  the place of our sanctuary."
24,17,13,"O"
24,17,14,"Heal me, O"
24,17,15,"Behold, they say unto me, Where  is  the word of the"
24,17,16,"As for me, I have not hastened from  being  a pastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was  right  before thee."
24,17,17,"Be not a terror unto me: thou  art  my hope in the day of evil."
24,17,18,"Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction."
24,17,19,"Thus said the"
24,17,20,"And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the"
24,17,21,"Thus saith the"
24,17,22,"Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers."
24,17,23,"But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction."
24,17,24,"And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the"
24,17,25,"Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever."
24,17,26,"And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the"
24,17,27,"But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched."
24,18,1,"The word which came to Jeremiah from the"
24,18,2,"Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words."
24,18,3,"Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels."
24,18,4,"And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make  it ."
24,18,5,"Then the word of the"
24,18,6,"O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the"
24,18,7,"At what  instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy  it ;"
24,18,8,"If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them."
24,18,9,"And  at what  instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant  it ;"
24,18,10,"If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them."
24,18,11,"Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the"
24,18,12,"And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart."
24,18,13,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,18,14,"Will  a man  leave the snow of Lebanon  which cometh  from the rock of the field?  or  shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?"
24,18,15,"Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways  from  the ancient paths, to walk in paths,  in  a way not cast up;"
24,18,16,"To make their land desolate,  and  a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head."
24,18,17,"I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity."
24,18,18,"Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words."
24,18,19,"Give heed to me, O"
24,18,20,"Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them,  and  to turn away thy wrath from them."
24,18,21,"Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their  blood  by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and  be  widows; and let their men be put to death;  let  their young men  be  slain by the sword in battle."
24,18,22,"Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet."
24,18,23,"Yet,"
24,19,1,"Thus saith the"
24,19,2,"And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which  is  by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,"
24,19,3,"And say, Hear ye the word of the"
24,19,4,"Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;"
24,19,5,"They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire  for  burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake  it , neither came  it  into my mind:"
24,19,6,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the"
24,19,7,"And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth."
24,19,8,"And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof."
24,19,9,"And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them."
24,19,10,"Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,"
24,19,11,"And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the"
24,19,12,"Thus will I do unto this place, saith the"
24,19,13,"And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods."
24,19,14,"Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the"
24,19,15,"Thus saith the"
24,20,1,"Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who  was  also chief governor in the house of the"
24,20,2,"Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that  were  in the high gate of Benjamin, which  was  by the house of the"
24,20,3,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The"
24,20,4,"For thus saith the"
24,20,5,"Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon."
24,20,6,"And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies."
24,20,7,"O"
24,20,8,"For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the"
24,20,9,"Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But  his word  was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not  stay ."
24,20,10,"For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report,  say they , and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting,  saying , Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him."
24,20,11,"But the"
24,20,12,"But, O"
24,20,13,"Sing unto the"
24,20,14,"Cursed  be  the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed."
24,20,15,"Cursed  be  the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad."
24,20,16,"And let that man be as the cities which the"
24,20,17,"Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb  to be  always great  with me ."
24,20,18,"Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?"
24,21,1,"The word which came unto Jeremiah from the"
24,21,2,"Inquire, I pray thee, of the"
24,21,3,"Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:"
24,21,4,"Thus saith the"
24,21,5,"And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath."
24,21,6,"And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence."
24,21,7,"And afterward, saith the"
24,21,8,"And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the"
24,21,9,"He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey."
24,21,10,"For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the"
24,21,11,"And touching the house of the king of Judah,  say , Hear ye the word of the"
24,21,12,"O house of David, thus saith the"
24,21,13,"Behold, I  am  against thee, O inhabitant of the valley,  and  rock of the plain, saith the"

24,22,4,"For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people."
24,22,5,"But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the"
24,22,6,"For thus saith the"
24,22,7,"And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast  them  into the fire."
24,22,8,"And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the"

24,22,11,"For thus saith the"
24,22,12,"But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more."
24,22,13,"Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong;  that  useth his neighbour’s service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;"
24,22,14,"That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and  it is  cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion."
24,22,15,"Shalt thou reign, because thou closest  thyself  in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice,  and  then  it was  well with him?"
24,22,16,"He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then  it was  well  with him: was  not this to know me? saith the"
24,22,17,"But thine eyes and thine heart  are  not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do  it ."
24,22,18,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,22,19,"He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem."
24,22,20,"Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed."
24,22,21,"I spake unto thee in thy prosperity;  but  thou saidst, I will not hear. This  hath been  thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice."
24,22,22,"The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness."
24,22,23,"O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!"
24,22,24,"As  I live, saith the"
24,22,25,"And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand  of them  whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans."
24,22,26,"And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die."
24,22,27,"But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return."
24,22,28,"Is  this man Coniah a despised broken idol?  is he  a vessel wherein  is  no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?"
24,22,29,"O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the"
24,22,30,"Thus saith the"
24,23,1,"Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the"
24,23,2,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,23,3,"And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase."
24,23,4,"And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the"
24,23,5,"Behold, the days come, saith the"
24,23,6,"In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this  is  his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS."
24,23,7,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the"
24,23,8,"But, The"
24,23,9,"Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the"
24,23,10,"For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force  is  not right."
24,23,11,"For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the"
24,23,12,"Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery  ways  in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them,  even  the year of their visitation, saith the"
24,23,13,"And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err."
24,23,14,"I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah."
24,23,15,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,23,16,"Thus saith the"
24,23,17,"They say still unto them that despise me, The"

24,23,22,"But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings."
24,23,23,"Am  I a God at hand, saith the"
24,23,24,"Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the"
24,23,25,"I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed."
24,23,26,"How long shall  this  be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea,  they are  prophets of the deceit of their own heart;"
24,23,27,"Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal."
24,23,28,"The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What  is  the chaff to the wheat? saith the"
24,23,29,"Is  not my word like as a fire? saith the"
24,23,30,"Therefore, behold, I  am  against the prophets, saith the"

24,23,40,"And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten."
24,24,1,"The"
24,24,2,"One basket  had  very good figs,  even  like the figs  that are  first ripe: and the other basket  had  very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad."
24,24,3,"Then said the"
24,24,4,"Again the word of the"

24,24,7,"And I will give them an heart to know me, that I  am  the"

24,24,10,"And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers."
24,25,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that  was  the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;"

24,25,11,"And this whole land shall be a desolation,  and  an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years."
24,25,12,"And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished,  that  I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the"

24,25,14,"For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands."
24,25,15,"For thus saith the"

24,30,14,"All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity;  because  thy sins were increased."
24,30,15,"Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow  is  incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity:  because  thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee."
24,30,16,"Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey."
24,30,17,"For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the"
24,30,18,"Thus saith the"
24,30,19,"And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small."
24,30,20,"Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them."
24,30,21,"And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who  is  this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the"

24,31,9,"They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim  is  my firstborn."

24,31,30,"But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge."
24,31,31,"Behold, the days come, saith the"

24,32,2,"For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which  was  in the king of Judah’s house."
24,32,3,"For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the"
24,32,4,"And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;"
24,32,5,"And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the"
24,32,6,"And Jeremiah said, The word of the"

24,32,8,"So Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the"
24,32,9,"And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that  was  in Anathoth, and weighed him the money,  even  seventeen shekels of silver."
24,32,10,"And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed  it , and took witnesses, and weighed  him  the money in the balances."
24,32,11,"So I took the evidence of the purchase,  both  that which was sealed  according  to the law and custom, and that which was open:"
24,32,12,"And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle’s  son , and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison."
24,32,13,"And I charged Baruch before them, saying,"
24,32,14,"Thus saith the"
24,32,15,"For thus saith the"
24,32,16,"Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the"
24,32,17,"Ah Lord"
24,32,18,"Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the"
24,32,19,"Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes  are  open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:"
24,32,20,"Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,  even  unto this day, and in Israel, and among  other  men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;"
24,32,21,"And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;"
24,32,22,"And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;"
24,32,23,"And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:"
24,32,24,"Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest  it ."
24,32,25,"And thou hast said unto me, O Lord"
24,32,26,"Then came the word of the"
24,32,27,"Behold, I  am  the"
24,32,28,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,32,29,"And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger."
24,32,30,"For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the"
24,32,31,"For this city hath been to me  as  a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,"
24,32,32,"Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
24,32,33,"And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching  them , yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction."
24,32,34,"But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it."
24,32,35,"And they built the high places of Baal, which  are  in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through  the fire  unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin."
24,32,36,"And now therefore thus saith the"
24,32,37,"Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:"
24,32,38,"And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:"
24,32,39,"And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:"
24,32,40,"And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me."
24,32,41,"Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul."
24,32,42,"For thus saith the"
24,32,43,"And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say,  It is  desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans."
24,32,44,"Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal  them , and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the"

24,33,4,"For thus saith the"
24,33,5,"They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but  it is  to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city."
24,33,6,"Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth."
24,33,7,"And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first."
24,33,8,"And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me."
24,33,9,"And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it."

24,33,15,"In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land."
24,33,16,"In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this  is the name  wherewith she shall be called, The"

24,33,19,"And the word of the"
24,33,20,"Thus saith the"
24,33,21,"Then  may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers."
24,33,22,"As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me."
24,33,23,"Moreover the word of the"

24,34,1,"The word which came unto Jeremiah from the"
24,34,2,"Thus saith the"
24,34,3,"And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon."
24,34,4,"Yet hear the word of the"
24,34,5,"But  thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn  odours  for thee; and they will lament thee,  saying , Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the"
24,34,6,"Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,"
24,34,7,"When the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah."
24,34,8,"This is  the word that came unto Jeremiah from the"
24,34,9,"That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant,  being  an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them,  to wit , of a Jew his brother."
24,34,10,"Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let  them  go."
24,34,11,"But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids."
24,34,12,"Therefore the word of the"
24,34,13,"Thus saith the"
24,34,14,"At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear."
24,34,15,"And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:"
24,34,16,"But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids."
24,34,17,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,34,18,"And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,"
24,34,19,"The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;"
24,34,20,"I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth."
24,34,21,"And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which are gone up from you."
24,34,22,"Behold, I will command, saith the"
24,35,1,"The word which came unto Jeremiah from the"
24,35,2,"Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the"
24,35,3,"Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;"
24,35,4,"And I brought them into the house of the"
24,35,5,"And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine."
24,35,6,"But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine,  neither  ye, nor your sons for ever:"
24,35,7,"Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have  any : but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye  be  strangers."
24,35,8,"Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;"
24,35,9,"Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:"
24,35,10,"But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us."
24,35,11,"But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem."
24,35,12,"Then came the word of the"
24,35,13,"Thus saith the"
24,35,14,"The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father’s commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me."
24,35,15,"I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending  them , saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me."
24,35,16,"Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:"
24,35,17,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,35,18,"And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the"
24,35,19,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,36,1,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,  that  this word came unto Jeremiah from the"
24,36,2,"Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day."
24,36,3,"It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin."
24,36,4,"Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the"
24,36,5,"And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I  am  shut up; I cannot go into the house of the"
24,36,6,"Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the"

24,36,10,"Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the"
24,36,11,"When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the"
24,36,12,"Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there,  even  Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes."
24,36,13,"Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people."
24,36,14,"Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them."
24,36,15,"And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read  it  in their ears."
24,36,16,"Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words."
24,36,17,"And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?"
24,36,18,"Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote  them  with ink in the book."
24,36,19,"Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be."
24,36,20,"And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king."
24,36,21,"So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king."
24,36,22,"Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and  there was a fire  on the hearth burning before him."
24,36,23,"And it came to pass,  that  when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast  it  into the fire that  was  on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that  was  on the hearth."
24,36,24,"Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments,  neither  the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words."
24,36,25,"Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them."
24,36,26,"But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the"
24,36,27,"Then the word of the"
24,36,28,"Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned."
24,36,29,"And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the"
24,36,30,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,36,31,"And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not."
24,36,32,"Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words."
24,37,1,"And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah."
24,37,2,"But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the"

24,37,5,"Then Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem."
24,37,6,"Then came the word of the"

24,37,8,"And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire."
24,37,9,"Thus saith the"
24,37,10,"For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained  but  wounded men among them,  yet  should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire."
24,37,11,"And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,"
24,37,12,"Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people."
24,37,13,"And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward  was  there, whose name  was  Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans."
24,37,14,"Then said Jeremiah,  It is  false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes."
24,37,15,"Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison."
24,37,16,"When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;"
24,37,17,"Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there  any  word from the"
24,37,18,"Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?"
24,37,19,"Where  are  now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?"
24,37,20,"Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there."
24,37,21,"Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison."
24,38,1,"Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,"
24,38,2,"Thus saith the"
24,38,3,"Thus saith the"
24,38,4,"Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt."
24,38,5,"Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he  is  in your hand: for the king  is  not  he that  can do  any  thing against you."
24,38,6,"Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that  was  in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon  there was  no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire."
24,38,7,"Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;"
24,38,8,"Ebedmelech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the king, saying,"
24,38,9,"My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for  there is  no more bread in the city."
24,38,10,"Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die."
24,38,11,"So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah."
24,38,12,"And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now  these  old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so."
24,38,13,"So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison."
24,38,14,"Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that  is  in the house of the"
24,38,15,"Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare  it  unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?"
24,38,16,"So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying,  As  the"
24,38,17,"Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the"
24,38,18,"But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand."
24,38,19,"And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me."
24,38,20,"But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver  thee . Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the"
24,38,21,"But if thou refuse to go forth, this  is  the word that the"
24,38,22,"And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house  shall be  brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those  women  shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire,  and  they are turned away back."
24,38,23,"So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire."
24,38,24,"Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die."
24,38,25,"But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:"
24,38,26,"Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there."
24,38,27,"Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived."
24,38,28,"So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was  there  when Jerusalem was taken."
24,39,1,"In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it."
24,39,2,"And  in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth  day  of the month, the city was broken up."
24,39,3,"And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate,  even  Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon."
24,39,4,"And it came to pass,  that  when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain."
24,39,5,"But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him."
24,39,6,"Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah."
24,39,7,"Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon."
24,39,8,"And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem."
24,39,9,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained."
24,39,10,"But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time."
24,39,11,"Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,"
24,39,12,"Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee."
24,39,13,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s princes;"
24,39,14,"Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people."
24,39,15,"Now the word of the"
24,39,16,"Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the"
24,39,17,"But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the"
24,39,18,"For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the"
24,40,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah from the"
24,40,2,"And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The"
24,40,3,"Now the"
24,40,4,"And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which  were  upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land  is  before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go."
24,40,5,"Now while he was not yet gone back,  he said , Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go."
24,40,6,"Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land."
24,40,7,"Now when all the captains of the forces which  were  in the fields,  even  they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;"
24,40,8,"Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men."
24,40,9,"And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."
24,40,10,"As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put  them  in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken."
24,40,11,"Likewise when all the Jews that  were  in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that  were  in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;"
24,40,12,"Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much."
24,40,13,"Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that  were  in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,"
24,40,14,"And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not."
24,40,15,"Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know  it : wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?"
24,40,16,"But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael."
24,41,1,"Now it came to pass in the seventh month,  that  Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah."
24,41,2,"Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land."
24,41,3,"Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him,  even  with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there,  and  the men of war."
24,41,4,"And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew  it ,"
24,41,5,"That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria,  even  fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring  them  to the house of the"
24,41,6,"And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam."
24,41,7,"And it was  so , when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them,  and cast them  into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that  were  with him."
24,41,8,"But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren."
24,41,9,"Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah,  was  it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel:  and  Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with  them that were  slain."
24,41,10,"Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that  were  in Mizpah,  even  the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites."
24,41,11,"But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that  were  with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,"
24,41,12,"Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that  are  in Gibeon."
24,41,13,"Now it came to pass,  that  when all the people which  were  with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that  were  with him, then they were glad."
24,41,14,"So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah."
24,41,15,"But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites."
24,41,16,"Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that  were  with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after  that  he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,  even  mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:"
24,41,17,"And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,"
24,41,18,"Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land."
24,42,1,"Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,"
24,42,2,"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the"
24,42,3,"That the"
24,42,4,"Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard  you ; behold, I will pray unto the"
24,42,5,"Then they said to Jeremiah, The"
24,42,6,"Whether  it be  good, or whether  it be  evil, we will obey the voice of the"
24,42,7,"And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the"
24,42,8,"Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which  were  with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,"
24,42,9,"And said unto them, Thus saith the"
24,42,10,"If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull  you  down, and I will plant you, and not pluck  you  up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you."
24,42,11,"Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the"
24,42,12,"And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land."
24,42,13,"But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the"
24,42,14,"Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:"
24,42,15,"And now therefore hear the word of the"
24,42,16,"Then it shall come to pass,  that  the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die."
24,42,17,"So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them."
24,42,18,"For thus saith the"
24,42,19,"The"
24,42,20,"For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the"
24,42,21,"And  now  I have this day declared  it  to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the"
24,42,22,"Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go  and  to sojourn."
24,43,1,"And it came to pass,  that  when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the"
24,43,2,"Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the"
24,43,3,"But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon."
24,43,4,"So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the"
24,43,5,"But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;"
24,43,6,"Even  men, and women, and children, and the king’s daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah."
24,43,7,"So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the"
24,43,8,"Then came the word of the"
24,43,9,"Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which  is  at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;"
24,43,10,"And say unto them, Thus saith the"
24,43,11,"And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt,  and deliver  such  as are  for death to death; and such  as are  for captivity to captivity; and such  as are  for the sword to the sword."
24,43,12,"And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace."
24,43,13,"He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that  is  in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire."
24,44,1,"The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,"
24,44,2,"Thus saith the"
24,44,3,"Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense,  and  to serve other gods, whom they knew not,  neither  they, ye, nor your fathers."
24,44,4,"Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending  them , saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate."
24,44,5,"But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods."
24,44,6,"Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted  and  desolate, as at this day."
24,44,7,"Therefore now thus saith the"
24,44,8,"In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?"
24,44,9,"Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?"
24,44,10,"They are not humbled  even  unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers."
24,44,11,"Therefore thus saith the"
24,44,12,"And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed,  and  fall in the land of Egypt; they shall  even  be consumed by the sword  and  by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration,  and  an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach."
24,44,13,"For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:"
24,44,14,"So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape."
24,44,15,"Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,"
24,44,16,"As for  the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the"
24,44,17,"But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for  then  had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil."
24,44,18,"But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all  things , and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine."
24,44,19,"And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?"
24,44,20,"Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him  that  answer, saying,"
24,44,21,"The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the"
24,44,22,"So that the"
24,44,23,"Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the"
24,44,24,"Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the"
24,44,25,"Thus saith the"
24,44,26,"Therefore hear ye the word of the"
24,44,27,"Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that  are  in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them."
24,44,28,"Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs."
24,44,29,"And this  shall be  a sign unto you, saith the"
24,44,30,"Thus saith the"
24,45,1,"The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,"
24,45,2,"Thus saith the"
24,45,3,"Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the"
24,45,4,"Thus shalt thou say unto him, The"
24,45,5,"And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek  them  not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the"
24,46,1,"The word of the"
24,46,2,"Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah."
24,46,3,"Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle."
24,46,4,"Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with  your  helmets; furbish the spears,  and  put on the brigandines."
24,46,5,"Wherefore have I seen them dismayed  and  turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back:  for  fear  was  round about, saith the"
24,46,6,"Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates."
24,46,7,"Who  is  this  that  cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?"
24,46,8,"Egypt riseth up like a flood, and  his  waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up,  and  will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof."
24,46,9,"Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle  and  bend the bow."
24,46,10,"For this  is  the day of the Lord"
24,46,11,"Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines;  for  thou shalt not be cured."
24,46,12,"The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty,  and  they are fallen both together."
24,46,13,"The word that the"
24,46,14,"Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee."
24,46,15,"Why are thy valiant  men  swept away? they stood not, because the"
24,46,16,"He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword."
24,46,17,"They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt  is but  a noise; he hath passed the time appointed."
24,46,18,"As  I live, saith the King, whose name  is  the"
24,46,19,"O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant."
24,46,20,"Egypt  is like  a very fair heifer,  but  destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north."
24,46,21,"Also her hired men  are  in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back,  and  are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them,  and  the time of their visitation."
24,46,22,"The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood."
24,46,23,"They shall cut down her forest, saith the"
24,46,24,"The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north."
24,46,25,"The"

24,46,27,"But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make  him  afraid."
24,46,28,"Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the"
24,47,1,"The word of the"
24,47,2,"Thus saith the"
24,47,3,"At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong  horses , at the rushing of his chariots,  and at  the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to  their  children for feebleness of hands;"
24,47,4,"Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines,  and  to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the"
24,47,5,"Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off  with  the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?"
24,47,6,"O thou sword of the"
24,47,7,"How can it be quiet, seeing the"
24,48,1,"Against Moab thus saith the"
24,48,2,"There shall be  no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from  being  a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee."
24,48,3,"A voice of crying  shall be  from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction."
24,48,4,"Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard."
24,48,5,"For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction."
24,48,6,"Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness."
24,48,7,"For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity  with  his priests and his princes together."
24,48,8,"And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the"
24,48,9,"Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein."
24,48,10,"Cursed  be  he that doeth the work of the"
24,48,11,"Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed."
24,48,12,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the"
24,48,13,"And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence."
24,48,14,"How say ye, We  are  mighty and strong men for the war?"
24,48,15,"Moab is spoiled, and gone up  out of  her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name  is  the"

24,48,17,"All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken,  and  the beautiful rod!"
24,48,18,"Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from  thy  glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee,  and  he shall destroy thy strong holds."
24,48,19,"O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth,  and  say, What is done?"
24,48,20,"Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,"
24,48,21,"And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,"
24,48,22,"And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,"
24,48,23,"And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,"

24,48,25,"The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the"
24,48,26,"Make ye him drunken: for he magnified  himself  against the"
24,48,27,"For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy."
24,48,28,"O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove  that  maketh her nest in the sides of the hole’s mouth."
24,48,29,"We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart."
24,48,30,"I know his wrath, saith the"
24,48,31,"Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab;  mine heart  shall mourn for the men of Kirheres."
24,48,32,"O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach  even  to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage."
24,48,33,"And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting;  their  shouting  shall be  no shouting."
24,48,34,"From the cry of Heshbon  even  unto Elealeh,  and even  unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar  even  unto Horonaim,  as  an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate."
24,48,35,"Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the"
24,48,36,"Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches  that  he hath gotten are perished."
24,48,37,"For every head  shall be  bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands  shall be  cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth."
24,48,38,"There shall be  lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein  is  no pleasure, saith the"
24,48,39,"They shall howl,  saying , How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him."
24,48,40,"For thus saith the"
24,48,41,"Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men’s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs."
24,48,42,"And Moab shall be destroyed from  being  a people, because he hath magnified  himself  against the"
24,48,43,"Fear, and the pit, and the snare,  shall be  upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the"
24,48,44,"He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it,  even  upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the"
24,48,45,"They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones."
24,48,46,"Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives."
24,48,47,"Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the"
24,49,1,"Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the"
24,49,2,"Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the"

24,49,4,"Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures,  saying , Who shall come unto me?"
24,49,5,"Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord"
24,49,6,"And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the"
24,49,7,"Concerning Edom, thus saith the"
24,49,8,"Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time  that  I will visit him."
24,49,9,"If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave  some  gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough."
24,49,10,"But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he  is  not."
24,49,11,"Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve  them  alive; and let thy widows trust in me."
24,49,12,"For thus saith the"

24,49,16,"Thy terribleness hath deceived thee,  and  the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the"
24,49,17,"Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof."
24,49,18,"As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour  cities  thereof, saith the"
24,49,19,"Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who  is  a chosen  man, that  I may appoint over her? for who  is  like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who  is  that shepherd that will stand before me?"
24,49,20,"Therefore hear the counsel of the"
24,49,21,"The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea."
24,49,22,"Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs."
24,49,23,"Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted;  there is  sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet."
24,49,24,"Damascus is waxed feeble,  and  turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on  her : anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail."
24,49,25,"How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!"
24,49,26,"Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the"
24,49,27,"And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad."
24,49,28,"Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the"
24,49,29,"Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear  is  on every side."
24,49,30,"Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the"
24,49,31,"Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the"

24,49,34,"The word of the"

24,50,12,"Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations  shall be  a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert."
24,50,13,"Because of the wrath of the"

24,50,43,"The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him,  and  pangs as of a woman in travail."
24,50,44,"Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who  is  a chosen  man, that  I may appoint over her? for who  is  like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who  is  that shepherd that will stand before me?"
24,50,45,"Therefore hear ye the counsel of the"
24,50,46,"At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations."
24,51,1,"Thus saith the"
24,51,2,"And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about."
24,51,3,"Against  him that  bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against  him that  lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host."
24,51,4,"Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and  they that are  thrust through in her streets."
24,51,5,"For Israel  hath  not  been  forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the"

24,51,41,"How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!"
24,51,42,"The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof."
24,51,43,"Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth  any  son of man pass thereby."
24,51,44,"And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall."

24,51,60,"So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon,  even  all these words that are written against Babylon."
24,51,61,"And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;"
24,51,62,"Then shalt thou say, O"
24,51,63,"And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book,  that  thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:"
24,51,64,"And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far  are  the words of Jeremiah."
24,52,1,"Zedekiah  was  one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name  was  Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."

24,52,5,"So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah."
24,52,6,"And in the fourth month, in the ninth  day  of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land."
24,52,7,"Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which  was  by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans  were  by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain."
24,52,8,"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him."
24,52,9,"Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him."
24,52,10,"And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah."
24,52,11,"Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death."
24,52,12,"Now in the fifth month, in the tenth  day  of the month, which  was  the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard,  which  served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,"
24,52,13,"And burned the house of the"
24,52,14,"And all the army of the Chaldeans, that  were  with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about."
24,52,15,"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive  certain  of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude."
24,52,16,"But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left  certain  of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen."
24,52,17,"Also the pillars of brass that  were  in the house of the"
24,52,18,"The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away."
24,52,19,"And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups;  that  which  was  of gold  in  gold, and  that  which  was  of silver  in  silver, took the captain of the guard away."
24,52,20,"The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that  were  under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the"
24,52,21,"And  concerning  the pillars, the height of one pillar  was  eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof  was  four fingers:  it was  hollow."
24,52,22,"And a chapiter of brass  was  upon it; and the height of one chapiter  was  five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all  of  brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates  were  like unto these."
24,52,23,"And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side;  and  all the pomegranates upon the network  were  an hundred round about."
24,52,24,"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:"
24,52,25,"He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city."
24,52,26,"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah."
24,52,27,"And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land."
24,52,28,"This  is  the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:"
24,52,29,"In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:"
24,52,30,"In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons  were  four thousand and six hundred."
24,52,31,"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth  day  of the month,  that  Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the  first  year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,"
24,52,32,"And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that  were  with him in Babylon,"
24,52,33,"And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life."
24,52,34,"And  for  his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life."
25,1,1,"How doth the city sit solitary,  that was  full of people!  how  is she become as a widow! she  that was  great among the nations,  and  princess among the provinces,  how  is she become tributary!"
25,1,2,"She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears  are  on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort  her : all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies."
25,1,3,"Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits."
25,1,4,"The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she  is  in bitterness."
25,1,5,"Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the"
25,1,6,"And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts  that  find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer."
25,1,7,"Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her,  and  did mock at her sabbaths."
25,1,8,"Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward."
25,1,9,"Her filthiness  is  in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O"
25,1,10,"The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen  that  the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command  that  they should not enter into thy congregation."
25,1,11,"All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O"

25,1,15,"The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty  men  in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah,  as  in a winepress."
25,1,16,"For these  things  I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed."
25,1,17,"Zion spreadeth forth her hands,  and there is  none to comfort her: the"
25,1,18,"The"
25,1,19,"I called for my lovers,  but  they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls."
25,1,20,"Behold, O"
25,1,21,"They have heard that I sigh:  there is  none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done  it : thou wilt bring the day  that  thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me."
25,1,22,"Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs  are  many, and my heart  is  faint."
25,2,1,"How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger,  and  cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!"
25,2,2,"The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought  them  down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof."
25,2,3,"He hath cut off in  his  fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire,  which  devoureth round about."
25,2,4,"He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all  that were  pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire."
25,2,5,"The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation."
25,2,6,"And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as  if it were of  a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the"
25,2,7,"The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the"
25,2,8,"The"

25,2,10,"The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground,  and  keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground."
25,2,11,"Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city."
25,2,12,"They say to their mothers, Where  is  corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers’ bosom."
25,2,13,"What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach  is  great like the sea: who can heal thee?"
25,2,14,"Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment."
25,2,15,"All that pass by clap  their  hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem,  saying, Is  this the city that  men  call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?"
25,2,16,"All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed  her  up: certainly this  is  the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen  it ."
25,2,17,"The"
25,2,18,"Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease."
25,2,19,"Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street."
25,2,20,"Behold, O"
25,2,21,"The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain  them  in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed,  and  not pitied."

25,3,2,"He hath led me, and brought  me into  darkness, but not  into  light."
25,3,3,"Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand  against me  all the day."
25,3,4,"My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones."
25,3,5,"He hath builded against me, and compassed  me  with gall and travail."
25,3,6,"He hath set me in dark places, as  they that be  dead of old."
25,3,7,"He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy."
25,3,8,"Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer."
25,3,9,"He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked."
25,3,10,"He  was  unto me  as  a bear lying in wait,  and as  a lion in secret places."
25,3,11,"He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate."
25,3,12,"He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow."
25,3,13,"He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins."
25,3,14,"I was a derision to all my people;  and  their song all the day."
25,3,15,"He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood."
25,3,16,"He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes."
25,3,17,"And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity."

26,1,4,"And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness  was  about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire."
26,1,5,"Also out of the midst thereof  came  the likeness of four living creatures. And this  was  their appearance; they had the likeness of a man."
26,1,6,"And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings."
26,1,7,"And their feet  were  straight feet; and the sole of their feet  was  like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass."
26,1,8,"And  they had  the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings."
26,1,9,"Their wings  were  joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward."
26,1,10,"As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle."
26,1,11,"Thus  were  their faces: and their wings  were  stretched upward; two  wings  of every one  were  joined one to another, and two covered their bodies."
26,1,12,"And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went;  and  they turned not when they went."
26,1,13,"As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance  was  like burning coals of fire,  and  like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning."
26,1,14,"And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning."
26,1,15,"Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces."
26,1,16,"The appearance of the wheels and their work  was  like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work  was  as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel."
26,1,17,"When they went, they went upon their four sides:  and  they turned not when they went."
26,1,18,"As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings  were  full of eyes round about them four."
26,1,19,"And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up."
26,1,20,"Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither  was their  spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature  was  in the wheels."
26,1,21,"When those went,  these  went; and when those stood,  these  stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature  was  in the wheels."
26,1,22,"And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature  was  as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above."
26,1,23,"And under the firmament  were  their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies."
26,1,24,"And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings."
26,1,25,"And there was a voice from the firmament that  was  over their heads, when they stood,  and  had let down their wings."
26,1,26,"And above the firmament that  was  over their heads  was  the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne  was  the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it."
26,1,27,"And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about."
26,1,28,"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so  was  the appearance of the brightness round about. This  was  the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the"
26,2,1,"And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee."
26,2,2,"And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me."
26,2,3,"And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me,  even  unto this very day."
26,2,4,"For  they are  impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord"
26,2,5,"And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they  are  a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them."
26,2,6,"And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns  be  with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they  be  a rebellious house."
26,2,7,"And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they  are  most rebellious."
26,2,8,"But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee."
26,2,9,"And when I looked, behold, an hand  was  sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book  was  therein;"
26,2,10,"And he spread it before me; and it  was  written within and without: and  there was  written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe."
26,3,1,"Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel."
26,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll."
26,3,3,"And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat  it ; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness."
26,3,4,"And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them."
26,3,5,"For thou  art  not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language,  but  to the house of Israel;"
26,3,6,"Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee."
26,3,7,"But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel  are  impudent and hardhearted."
26,3,8,"Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads."
26,3,9,"As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they  be  a rebellious house."
26,3,10,"Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears."
26,3,11,"And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord"
26,3,12,"Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing,  saying , Blessed  be  the glory of the"
26,3,13,"I heard  also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing."
26,3,14,"So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the"
26,3,15,"Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days."
26,3,16,"And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the"
26,3,17,"Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me."
26,3,18,"When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked  man  shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand."
26,3,19,"Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul."
26,3,20,"Again, When a righteous  man  doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand."
26,3,21,"Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous  man , that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul."
26,3,22,"And the hand of the"
26,3,23,"Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the"
26,3,24,"Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house."
26,3,25,"But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:"
26,3,26,"And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they  are  a rebellious house."
26,3,27,"But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord"
26,4,1,"Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city,  even  Jerusalem:"
26,4,2,"And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set  battering  rams against it round about."
26,4,3,"Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it  for  a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This  shall be  a sign to the house of Israel."
26,4,4,"Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it:  according  to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity."
26,4,5,"For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel."
26,4,6,"And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year."
26,4,7,"Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm  shall be  uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it."
26,4,8,"And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege."
26,4,9,"Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof,  according  to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof."
26,4,10,"And thy meat which thou shalt eat  shall be  by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it."
26,4,11,"Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink."
26,4,12,"And thou shalt eat it  as  barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight."
26,4,13,"And the"
26,4,14,"Then said I, Ah Lord"
26,4,15,"Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith."
26,4,16,"Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:"
26,4,17,"That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity."
26,5,1,"And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber’s rasor, and cause  it  to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the  hair ."
26,5,2,"Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part,  and  smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them."
26,5,3,"Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts."
26,5,4,"Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire;  for  thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel."
26,5,5,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,5,6,"And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that  are  round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them."
26,5,7,"Therefore thus saith the Lord"
26,5,8,"Therefore thus saith the Lord"
26,5,9,"And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations."
26,5,10,"Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds."
26,5,11,"Wherefore,  as  I live, saith the Lord"
26,5,12,"A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them."
26,5,13,"Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the"
26,5,14,"Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that  are  round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by."
26,5,15,"So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that  are  round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the"
26,5,16,"When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for  their  destruction,  and  which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:"
26,5,17,"So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the"
26,6,1,"And the word of the"
26,6,2,"Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,"
26,6,3,"And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord"
26,6,4,"And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain  men  before your idols."
26,6,5,"And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars."
26,6,6,"In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished."
26,6,7,"And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I  am  the"

26,6,9,"And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations."
26,6,10,"And they shall know that I  am  the"
26,6,11,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,6,12,"He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them."
26,6,13,"Then shall ye know that I  am  the"
26,6,14,"So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I  am  the"

26,7,8,"Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations."

26,7,11,"Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them  shall remain , nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither  shall there be  wailing for them."
26,7,12,"The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath  is  upon all the multitude thereof."
26,7,13,"For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision  is  touching the whole multitude thereof,  which  shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life."
26,7,14,"They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath  is  upon all the multitude thereof."
26,7,15,"The sword  is  without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that  is  in the field shall die with the sword; and he that  is  in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him."

26,8,1,"And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth  month , in the fifth  day  of the month,  as  I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord"
26,8,2,"Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber."
26,8,3,"And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where  was  the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy."
26,8,4,"And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel  was  there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain."
26,8,5,"Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry."
26,8,6,"He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do?  even  the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again,  and  thou shalt see greater abominations."
26,8,7,"And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall."
26,8,8,"Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door."
26,8,9,"And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here."
26,8,10,"So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about."
26,8,11,"And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up."
26,8,12,"Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The"
26,8,13,"He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again,  and  thou shalt see greater abominations that they do."
26,8,14,"Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the"
26,8,15,"Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen  this , O son of man? turn thee yet again,  and  thou shalt see greater abominations than these."
26,8,16,"And he brought me into the inner court of the"
26,8,17,"Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen  this , O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose."
26,8,18,"Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice,  yet  will I not hear them."
26,9,1,"He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man  with  his destroying weapon in his hand."
26,9,2,"And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them  was  clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar."
26,9,3,"And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which  had  the writer’s inkhorn by his side;"
26,9,4,"And the"
26,9,5,"And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:"
26,9,6,"Slay utterly old  and  young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom  is  the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which  were  before the house."
26,9,7,"And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city."
26,9,8,"And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord"
26,9,9,"Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah  is  exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The"
26,9,10,"And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity,  but  I will recompense their way upon their head."
26,9,11,"And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which  had  the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me."
26,10,1,"Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne."
26,10,2,"And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels,  even  under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter  them  over the city. And he went in in my sight."
26,10,3,"Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court."
26,10,4,"Then the glory of the"
26,10,5,"And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard  even  to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh."
26,10,6,"And it came to pass,  that  when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels."
26,10,7,"And  one  cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that  was  between the cherubims, and took  thereof , and put  it  into the hands of  him that was  clothed with linen: who took  it , and went out."
26,10,8,"And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand under their wings."
26,10,9,"And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels  was  as the colour of a beryl stone."
26,10,10,"And  as for  their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel."
26,10,11,"When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went."
26,10,12,"And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels,  were  full of eyes round about,  even  the wheels that they four had."
26,10,13,"As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel."
26,10,14,"And every one had four faces: the first face  was  the face of a cherub, and the second face  was  the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle."
26,10,15,"And the cherubims were lifted up. This  is  the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar."
26,10,16,"And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them."
26,10,17,"When they stood,  these  stood; and when they were lifted up,  these  lifted up themselves  also : for the spirit of the living creature  was  in them."

26,10,21,"Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man  was  under their wings."
26,10,22,"And the likeness of their faces  was  the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward."
26,11,1,"Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the"

26,16,38,"And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy."
26,16,39,"And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare."
26,16,40,"They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords."
26,16,41,"And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more."
26,16,42,"So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry."
26,16,43,"Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these  things ; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon  thine  head, saith the Lord"

26,16,46,"And thine elder sister  is  Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand,  is  Sodom and her daughters."
26,16,47,"Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as  if that were  a very little  thing , thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways."
26,16,48,"As  I live, saith the Lord"
26,16,49,"Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy."
26,16,50,"And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw  good ."
26,16,51,"Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done."
26,16,52,"Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters."
26,16,53,"When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then  will I bring again  the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:"
26,16,54,"That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them."
26,16,55,"When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate."
26,16,56,"For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,"
26,16,57,"Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of  thy  reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all  that are  round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about."
26,16,58,"Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the"
26,16,59,"For thus saith the Lord"
26,16,60,"Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant."
26,16,61,"Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant."
26,16,62,"And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I  am  the"

26,17,5,"He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed  it  by great waters,  and  set it  as  a willow tree."
26,17,6,"And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs."
26,17,7,"There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation."
26,17,8,"It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine."
26,17,9,"Say thou, Thus saith the Lord"

26,17,14,"That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up,  but  that by keeping of his covenant it might stand."
26,17,15,"But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such  things ? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?"
26,17,16,"As  I live, saith the Lord"
26,17,17,"Neither shall Pharaoh with  his  mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:"

26,18,3,"As  I live, saith the Lord"
26,18,4,"Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die."
26,18,5,"But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,"
26,18,6,"And  hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour’s wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,"
26,18,7,"And hath not oppressed any,  but  hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;"
26,18,8,"He  that  hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase,  that  hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,"
26,18,9,"Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he  is  just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord"
26,18,10,"If he beget a son  that is  a robber, a shedder of blood, and  that  doeth the like to  any  one of these  things ,"
26,18,11,"And that doeth not any of those  duties , but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour’s wife,"
26,18,12,"Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,"
26,18,13,"Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him."
26,18,14,"Now, lo,  if  he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,"
26,18,15,"That  hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour’s wife,"
26,18,16,"Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence,  but  hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,"
26,18,17,"That  hath taken off his hand from the poor,  that  hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live."
26,18,18,"As for  his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did  that  which  is  not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity."
26,18,19,"Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right,  and  hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live."
26,18,20,"The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him."
26,18,21,"But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die."
26,18,22,"All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live."
26,18,23,"Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord"
26,18,24,"But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity,  and  doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked  man  doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die."
26,18,25,"Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?"
26,18,26,"When a righteous  man  turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die."
26,18,27,"Again, when the wicked  man  turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive."
26,18,28,"Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die."
26,18,29,"Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?"
26,18,30,"Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord"
26,18,31,"Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?"
26,18,32,"For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord"
26,19,1,"Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,"
26,19,2,"And say, What  is  thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions."
26,19,3,"And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men."
26,19,4,"The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt."
26,19,5,"Now when she saw that she had waited,  and  her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps,  and  made him a young lion."
26,19,6,"And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey,  and  devoured men."
26,19,7,"And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring."
26,19,8,"Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit."
26,19,9,"And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel."
26,19,10,"Thy mother  is  like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters."
26,19,11,"And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches."
26,19,12,"But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them."
26,19,13,"And now she  is  planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground."
26,19,14,"And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches,  which  hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod  to be  a sceptre to rule. This  is  a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation."
26,20,1,"And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth  month , the tenth  day  of the month,  that  certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the"

26,20,7,"Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I  am  the"
26,20,8,"But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt."
26,20,9,"But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they  were , in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt."
26,20,10,"Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness."
26,20,11,"And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which  if  a man do, he shall even live in them."
26,20,12,"Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I  am  the"
26,20,13,"But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which  if  a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them."
26,20,14,"But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out."
26,20,15,"Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given  them , flowing with milk and honey, which  is  the glory of all lands;"
26,20,16,"Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols."
26,20,17,"Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness."
26,20,18,"But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:"

26,20,22,"Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth."
26,20,23,"I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;"
26,20,24,"Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols."
26,20,25,"Wherefore I gave them also statutes  that were  not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;"

26,20,27,"Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord"
26,20,28,"For  when I had brought them into the land,  for  the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings."
26,20,29,"Then I said unto them, What  is  the high place whereunto ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day."
26,20,30,"Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord"
26,20,31,"For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel?  As  I live, saith the Lord"

26,20,35,"And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face."
26,20,36,"Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord"

26,21,20,"Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced."
26,21,21,"For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made  his  arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver."
26,21,22,"At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint  battering  rams against the gates, to cast a mount,  and  to build a fort."

26,23,4,"And the names of them  were  Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus  were  their names; Samaria  is  Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah."
26,23,5,"And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians  her  neighbours,"
26,23,6,"Which were  clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses."
26,23,7,"Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them  that were  the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself."
26,23,8,"Neither left she her whoredoms  brought  from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her."
26,23,9,"Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted."
26,23,10,"These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her."
26,23,11,"And when her sister Aholibah saw  this , she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in  her  whoredoms."
26,23,12,"She doted upon the Assyrians  her  neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men."
26,23,13,"Then I saw that she was defiled,  that  they  took  both one way,"
26,23,14,"And  that  she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,"
26,23,15,"Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:"
26,23,16,"And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea."
26,23,17,"And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them."
26,23,18,"So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister."
26,23,19,"Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt."
26,23,20,"For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh  is as  the flesh of asses, and whose issue  is like  the issue of horses."
26,23,21,"Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth."

26,30,23,"And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries."
26,30,24,"And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh’s arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded  man ."
26,30,25,"But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I  am  the"

26,31,1,"And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third  month , in the first  day  of the month,  that  the word of the"
26,31,2,"Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?"
26,31,3,"Behold, the Assyrian  was  a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs."
26,31,4,"The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field."
26,31,5,"Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth."
26,31,6,"All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations."
26,31,7,"Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters."
26,31,8,"The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty."
26,31,9,"I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that  were  in the garden of God, envied him."
26,31,10,"Therefore thus saith the Lord"
26,31,11,"I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness."
26,31,12,"And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him."
26,31,13,"Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:"
26,31,14,"To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit."
26,31,15,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,31,16,"I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth."
26,31,17,"They also went down into hell with him unto  them that be  slain with the sword; and  they that were  his arm,  that  dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen."
26,31,18,"To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with  them that be  slain by the sword. This  is  Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord"
26,32,1,"And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first  day  of the month,  that  the word of the"
26,32,2,"Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou  art  as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers."
26,32,3,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,32,4,"Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee."
26,32,5,"And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height."
26,32,6,"I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest,  even  to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee."
26,32,7,"And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light."
26,32,8,"All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord"
26,32,9,"I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known."
26,32,10,"Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at  every  moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall."
26,32,11,"For thus saith the Lord"
26,32,12,"By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed."
26,32,13,"I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them."
26,32,14,"Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord"

26,32,16,"This  is  the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her,  even  for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord"
26,32,17,"It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth  day  of the month,  that  the word of the"
26,32,18,"Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down,  even  her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit."
26,32,19,"Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised."
26,32,20,"They shall fall in the midst of  them that are  slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes."
26,32,21,"The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword."
26,32,22,"Asshur  is  there and all her company: his graves  are  about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword:"
26,32,23,"Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living."
26,32,24,"There  is  Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit."
26,32,25,"They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves  are  round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of  them that be  slain."
26,32,26,"There  is  Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves  are  round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living."
26,32,27,"And they shall not lie with the mighty  that are  fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though  they were  the terror of the mighty in the land of the living."
26,32,28,"Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with  them that are  slain with the sword."
26,32,29,"There  is  Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by  them that were  slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit."
26,32,30,"There  be  the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with  them that be  slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit."
26,32,31,"Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude,  even  Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord"
26,32,32,"For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with  them that are  slain with the sword,  even  Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord"
26,33,1,"Again the word of the"
26,33,2,"Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:"
26,33,3,"If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;"
26,33,4,"Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head."
26,33,5,"He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul."
26,33,6,"But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take  any  person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand."
26,33,7,"So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me."
26,33,8,"When I say unto the wicked, O wicked  man , thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked  man  shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand."
26,33,9,"Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul."
26,33,10,"Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins  be  upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?"
26,33,11,"Say unto them,  As  I live, saith the Lord"
26,33,12,"Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his  righteousness  in the day that he sinneth."
26,33,13,"When I shall say to the righteous,  that  he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it."
26,33,14,"Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;"
26,33,15,"If  the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die."
26,33,16,"None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live."
26,33,17,"Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal."
26,33,18,"When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby."
26,33,19,"But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby."
26,33,20,"Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways."
26,33,21,"And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth  month , in the fifth  day  of the month,  that  one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten."
26,33,22,"Now the hand of the"
26,33,23,"Then the word of the"
26,33,24,"Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we  are  many; the land is given us for inheritance."
26,33,25,"Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord"
26,33,26,"Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour’s wife: and shall ye possess the land?"
26,33,27,"Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord"
26,33,28,"For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through."
26,33,29,"Then shall they know that I  am  the"
26,33,30,"Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the"
26,33,31,"And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee  as  my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love,  but  their heart goeth after their covetousness."
26,33,32,"And, lo, thou  art  unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not."
26,33,33,"And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them."
26,34,1,"And the word of the"

26,34,3,"Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed:  but  ye feed not the flock."
26,34,4,"The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up  that which was  broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them."
26,34,5,"And they were scattered, because  there is  no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered."
26,34,6,"My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek  after them ."
26,34,7,"Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the"
26,34,8,"As  I live, saith the Lord"
26,34,9,"Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the"
26,34,10,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,34,11,"For thus saith the Lord"
26,34,12,"As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep  that are  scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day."
26,34,13,"And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country."
26,34,14,"I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and  in  a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel."
26,34,15,"I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord"
26,34,16,"I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up  that which was  broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment."
26,34,17,"And  as for  you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord"
26,34,18,"Seemeth it  a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?"
26,34,19,"And  as for  my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet."
26,34,20,"Therefore thus saith the Lord"
26,34,21,"Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;"
26,34,22,"Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle."
26,34,23,"And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them,  even  my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd."
26,34,24,"And I the"
26,34,25,"And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods."
26,34,26,"And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing."
26,34,27,"And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I  am  the"

26,35,14,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,35,15,"As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea,  even  all of it: and they shall know that I  am  the"

26,36,10,"And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel,  even  all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded:"

26,37,21,"And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord"
26,37,22,"And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:"
26,37,23,"Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God."
26,37,24,"And David my servant  shall be  king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them."
26,37,25,"And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein,  even  they, and their children, and their children’s children for ever: and my servant David  shall be  their prince for ever."
26,37,26,"Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore."
26,37,27,"My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
26,37,28,"And the heathen shall know that I the"
26,38,1,"And the word of the"
26,38,2,"Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,"
26,38,3,"And say, Thus saith the Lord"
26,38,4,"And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts  of armour, even  a great company  with  bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:"
26,38,5,"Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:"
26,38,6,"Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands:  and  many people with thee."
26,38,7,"Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them."
26,38,8,"After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land  that is  brought back from the sword,  and is  gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them."
26,38,9,"Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee."
26,38,10,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,38,11,"And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,"
26,38,12,"To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places  that are now  inhabited, and upon the people  that are  gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land."
26,38,13,"Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?"
26,38,14,"Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord"
26,38,15,"And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:"
26,38,16,"And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes."
26,38,17,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,38,18,"And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord"
26,38,19,"For in my jealousy  and  in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;"
26,38,20,"So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that  are  upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground."
26,38,21,"And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord"
26,38,22,"And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that  are  with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone."
26,38,23,"Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I  am  the"
26,39,1,"Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord"
26,39,2,"And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:"
26,39,3,"And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand."
26,39,4,"Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that  is  with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and  to  the beasts of the field to be devoured."
26,39,5,"Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken  it , saith the Lord"
26,39,6,"And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I  am  the"
26,39,7,"So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not  let them  pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I  am  the"
26,39,8,"Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord"
26,39,9,"And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:"
26,39,10,"So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down  any  out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord"
26,39,11,"And it shall come to pass in that day,  that  I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the  noses  of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call  it  The valley of Hamongog."
26,39,12,"And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land."
26,39,13,"Yea, all the people of the land shall bury  them ; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord"
26,39,14,"And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search."
26,39,15,"And the passengers  that  pass through the land, when  any  seeth a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog."
26,39,16,"And also the name of the city  shall be  Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land."
26,39,17,"And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord"
26,39,18,"Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan."
26,39,19,"And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you."
26,39,20,"Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord"
26,39,21,"And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them."
26,39,22,"So the house of Israel shall know that I  am  the"
26,39,23,"And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword."
26,39,24,"According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them."
26,39,25,"Therefore thus saith the Lord"
26,39,26,"After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made  them  afraid."
26,39,27,"When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;"
26,39,28,"Then shall they know that I  am  the"
26,39,29,"Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord"
26,40,1,"In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth  day  of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the"
26,40,2,"In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which  was  as the frame of a city on the south."
26,40,3,"And he brought me thither, and, behold,  there was  a man, whose appearance  was  like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate."
26,40,4,"And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew  them  unto thee  art  thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel."
26,40,5,"And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits  long  by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed."
26,40,6,"Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate,  which was  one reed broad; and the other threshold  of the gate, which was  one reed broad."
26,40,7,"And  every  little chamber  was  one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers  were  five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within  was  one reed."
26,40,8,"He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed."
26,40,9,"Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate  was  inward."
26,40,10,"And the little chambers of the gate eastward  were  three on this side, and three on that side; they three  were  of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side."
26,40,11,"And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits;  and  the length of the gate, thirteen cubits."
26,40,12,"The space also before the little chambers  was  one cubit  on this side , and the space  was  one cubit on that side: and the little chambers  were  six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side."
26,40,13,"He measured then the gate from the roof of  one  little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth  was  five and twenty cubits, door against door."
26,40,14,"He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate."
26,40,15,"And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate  were  fifty cubits."
26,40,16,"And  there were  narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows  were  round about inward: and upon  each  post  were  palm trees."
26,40,17,"Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo,  there were  chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers  were  upon the pavement."
26,40,18,"And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates  was  the lower pavement."
26,40,19,"Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward."
26,40,20,"And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof."
26,40,21,"And the little chambers thereof  were  three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof  was  fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits."
26,40,22,"And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees,  were  after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof  were  before them."
26,40,23,"And the gate of the inner court  was  over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits."
26,40,24,"After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures."
26,40,25,"And  there were  windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length  was  fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits."
26,40,26,"And  there were  seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof  were  before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof."
26,40,27,"And  there was  a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits."
26,40,28,"And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;"
26,40,29,"And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and  there were  windows in it and in the arches thereof round about:  it was  fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad."
26,40,30,"And the arches round about  were  five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad."
26,40,31,"And the arches thereof  were  toward the utter court; and palm trees  were  upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it  had  eight steps."
26,40,32,"And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures."
26,40,33,"And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof,  were  according to these measures: and  there were  windows therein and in the arches thereof round about:  it was  fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad."
26,40,34,"And the arches thereof  were  toward the outward court; and palm trees  were  upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it  had  eight steps."
26,40,35,"And he brought me to the north gate, and measured  it  according to these measures;"
26,40,36,"The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length  was  fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits."
26,40,37,"And the posts thereof  were  toward the utter court; and palm trees  were  upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it  had  eight steps."
26,40,38,"And the chambers and the entries thereof  were  by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering."
26,40,39,"And in the porch of the gate  were  two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering."
26,40,40,"And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate,  were  two tables; and on the other side, which  was  at the porch of the gate,  were  two tables."
26,40,41,"Four tables  were  on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew  their sacrifices ."
26,40,42,"And the four tables  were  of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice."
26,40,43,"And within  were  hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables  was  the flesh of the offering."
26,40,44,"And without the inner gate  were  the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which  was  at the side of the north gate; and their prospect  was  toward the south: one at the side of the east gate  having  the prospect toward the north."
26,40,45,"And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect  is  toward the south,  is  for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house."
26,40,46,"And the chamber whose prospect  is  toward the north  is  for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these  are  the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the"
26,40,47,"So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar  that was  before the house."
26,40,48,"And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured  each  post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate  was  three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side."
26,40,49,"The length of the porch  was  twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and  he brought me  by the steps whereby they went up to it: and  there were  pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side."
26,41,1,"Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side,  which was  the breadth of the tabernacle."
26,41,2,"And the breadth of the door  was  ten cubits; and the sides of the door  were  five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits."
26,41,3,"Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits."
26,41,4,"So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This  is  the most holy  place ."
26,41,5,"After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of  every  side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side."
26,41,6,"And the side chambers  were  three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which  was  of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house."
26,41,7,"And  there was  an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house  was still  upward, and so increased  from  the lowest  chamber  to the highest by the midst."
26,41,8,"I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers  were  a full reed of six great cubits."
26,41,9,"The thickness of the wall, which  was  for the side chamber without,  was  five cubits: and  that  which  was  left  was  the place of the side chambers that  were  within."
26,41,10,"And between the chambers  was  the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side."
26,41,11,"And the doors of the side chambers  were  toward  the place that was  left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left  was  five cubits round about."
26,41,12,"Now the building that  was  before the separate place at the end toward the west  was  seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building  was  five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits."
26,41,13,"So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;"
26,41,14,"Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits."
26,41,15,"And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which  was  behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;"
26,41,16,"The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows  were  covered;"
26,41,17,"To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure."
26,41,18,"And  it was  made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree  was  between a cherub and a cherub; and  every  cherub had two faces;"
26,41,19,"So that the face of a man  was  toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side:  it was  made through all the house round about."
26,41,20,"From the ground unto above the door  were  cherubims and palm trees made, and  on  the wall of the temple."
26,41,21,"The posts of the temple  were  squared,  and  the face of the sanctuary; the appearance  of the one  as the appearance  of the other ."
26,41,22,"The altar of wood  was  three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof,  were  of wood: and he said unto me, This  is  the table that  is  before the"
26,41,23,"And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors."
26,41,24,"And the doors had two leaves  apiece , two turning leaves; two  leaves  for the one door, and two leaves for the other  door ."
26,41,25,"And  there were  made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as  were  made upon the walls; and  there were  thick planks upon the face of the porch without."
26,41,26,"And  there were  narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and  upon  the side chambers of the house, and thick planks."
26,42,1,"Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that  was  over against the separate place, and which  was  before the building toward the north."
26,42,2,"Before the length of an hundred cubits  was  the north door, and the breadth  was  fifty cubits."
26,42,3,"Over against the twenty  cubits  which  were  for the inner court, and over against the pavement which  was  for the utter court,  was  gallery against gallery in three  stories ."
26,42,4,"And before the chambers  was  a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north."
26,42,5,"Now the upper chambers  were  shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building."
26,42,6,"For they  were  in three  stories , but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore  the building  was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground."
26,42,7,"And the wall that  was  without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof  was  fifty cubits."
26,42,8,"For the length of the chambers that  were  in the utter court  was  fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple  were  an hundred cubits."
26,42,9,"And from under these chambers  was  the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court."
26,42,10,"The chambers  were  in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building."
26,42,11,"And the way before them  was  like the appearance of the chambers which  were  toward the north, as long as they,  and  as broad as they: and all their goings out  were  both according to their fashions, and according to their doors."
26,42,12,"And according to the doors of the chambers that  were  toward the south  was  a door in the head of the way,  even  the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them."
26,42,13,"Then said he unto me, The north chambers  and  the south chambers, which  are  before the separate place, they  be  holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the"
26,42,14,"When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy  place  into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they  are  holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to  those things  which  are  for the people."
26,42,15,"Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect  is  toward the east, and measured it round about."
26,42,16,"He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about."
26,42,17,"He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about."
26,42,18,"He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed."
26,42,19,"He turned about to the west side,  and  measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed."
26,42,20,"He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred  reeds  long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place."
26,43,1,"Afterward he brought me to the gate,  even  the gate that looketh toward the east:"
26,43,2,"And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice  was  like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory."
26,43,3,"And  it was  according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,  even  according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions  were  like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face."
26,43,4,"And the glory of the"
26,43,5,"So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the"
26,43,6,"And I heard  him  speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me."
26,43,7,"And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile,  neither  they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places."
26,43,8,"In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger."
26,43,9,"Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever."
26,43,10,"Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern."
26,43,11,"And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write  it  in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them."
26,43,12,"This  is  the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about  shall be  most holy. Behold, this  is  the law of the house."
26,43,13,"And these  are  the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit  is  a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom  shall be  a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about  shall be  a span: and this  shall be  the higher place of the altar."
26,43,14,"And from the bottom  upon  the ground  even  to the lower settle  shall be  two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle  even  to the greater settle  shall be  four cubits, and the breadth  one  cubit."
26,43,15,"So the altar  shall be  four cubits; and from the altar and upward  shall be  four horns."
26,43,16,"And the altar  shall be  twelve  cubits  long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof."
26,43,17,"And the settle  shall be  fourteen  cubits  long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it  shall be  half a cubit; and the bottom thereof  shall be  a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east."
26,43,18,"And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord"
26,43,19,"And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord"
26,43,20,"And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put  it  on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it."
26,43,21,"Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary."
26,43,22,"And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse  it  with the bullock."
26,43,23,"When thou hast made an end of cleansing  it , thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish."
26,43,24,"And thou shalt offer them before the"
26,43,25,"Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat  for  a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish."
26,43,26,"Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves."
26,43,27,"And when these days are expired, it shall be,  that  upon the eighth day, and  so  forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord"
26,44,1,"Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it  was  shut."
26,44,2,"Then said the"
26,44,3,"It is  for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the"

26,44,5,"And the"
26,44,6,"And thou shalt say to the rebellious,  even  to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord"
26,44,7,"In that ye have brought  into my sanctuary  strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it,  even  my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations."
26,44,8,"And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves."
26,44,9,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,44,10,"And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity."
26,44,11,"Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary,  having  charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them."
26,44,12,"Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord"
26,44,13,"And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy  place : but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed."
26,44,14,"But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein."
26,44,15,"But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord"
26,44,16,"They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge."
26,44,17,"And it shall come to pass,  that  when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within."
26,44,18,"They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird  themselves  with any thing that causeth sweat."
26,44,19,"And when they go forth into the utter court,  even  into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments."
26,44,20,"Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads."
26,44,21,"Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court."
26,44,22,"Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before."
26,44,23,"And they shall teach my people  the difference  between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean."
26,44,24,"And in controversy they shall stand in judgment;  and  they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths."
26,44,25,"And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves."
26,44,26,"And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days."
26,44,27,"And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord"
26,44,28,"And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I  am  their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I  am  their possession."
26,44,29,"They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs."
26,44,30,"And the first of all the firstfruits of all  things , and every oblation of all, of every  sort  of your oblations, shall be the priest’s: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house."
26,44,31,"The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast."
26,45,1,"Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the"
26,45,2,"Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred  in length , with five hundred  in breadth , square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof."
26,45,3,"And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary  and  the most holy  place ."
26,45,4,"The holy  portion  of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the"
26,45,5,"And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers."
26,45,6,"And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy  portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel."
26,45,7,"And  a portion shall be  for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy  portion , and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy  portion , and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length  shall be  over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border."
26,45,8,"In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and  the rest of  the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes."
26,45,9,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,45,10,"Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath."
26,45,11,"The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer."
26,45,12,"And the shekel  shall be  twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh."
26,45,13,"This  is  the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley:"
26,45,14,"Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil,  ye shall offer  the tenth part of a bath out of the cor,  which is  an homer of ten baths; for ten baths  are  an homer:"
26,45,15,"And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord"
26,45,16,"All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel."
26,45,17,"And it shall be the prince’s part  to give  burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel."
26,45,18,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,45,19,"And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put  it  upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court."
26,45,20,"And so thou shalt do the seventh  day  of the month for every one that erreth, and for  him that is  simple: so shall ye reconcile the house."
26,45,21,"In the first  month , in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten."
26,45,22,"And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock  for  a sin offering."
26,45,23,"And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the"
26,45,24,"And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah."
26,45,25,"In the seventh  month , in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil."
26,46,1,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,46,2,"And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of  that  gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening."
26,46,3,"Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the"
26,46,4,"And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the"
26,46,5,"And the meat offering  shall be  an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah."
26,46,6,"And in the day of the new moon  it shall be  a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish."
26,46,7,"And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah."
26,46,8,"And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of  that  gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof."
26,46,9,"But when the people of the land shall come before the"
26,46,10,"And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth."
26,46,11,"And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah."
26,46,12,"Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the"
26,46,13,"Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the"
26,46,14,"And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the"
26,46,15,"Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning  for  a continual burnt offering."
26,46,16,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,46,17,"But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons’ for them."
26,46,18,"Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession;  but  he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession."
26,46,19,"After he brought me through the entry, which  was  at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there  was  a place on the two sides westward."
26,46,20,"Then said he unto me, This  is  the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear  them  not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people."
26,46,21,"Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court  there was  a court."
26,46,22,"In the four corners of the court  there were  courts joined of forty  cubits  long and thirty broad: these four corners  were  of one measure."
26,46,23,"And  there was  a row  of building  round about in them, round about them four, and  it was  made with boiling places under the rows round about."
26,46,24,"Then said he unto me, These  are  the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people."
26,47,1,"Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house  stood toward  the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south  side  of the altar."
26,47,2,"Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side."
26,47,3,"And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters  were  to the ancles."
26,47,4,"Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters  were  to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters  were  to the loins."
26,47,5,"Afterward he measured a thousand;  and it was  a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over."
26,47,6,"And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen  this ? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river."
26,47,7,"Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river  were  very many trees on the one side and on the other."
26,47,8,"Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea:  which being  brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed."
26,47,9,"And it shall come to pass,  that  every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh."
26,47,10,"And it shall come to pass,  that  the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a  place  to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many."
26,47,11,"But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt."
26,47,12,"And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine."
26,47,13,"Thus saith the Lord"
26,47,14,"And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another:  concerning  the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance."
26,47,15,"And this  shall be  the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;"
26,47,16,"Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which  is  between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which  is  by the coast of Hauran."
26,47,17,"And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And  this is  the north side."
26,47,18,"And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel  by  Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And  this is  the east side."
26,47,19,"And the south side southward, from Tamar  even  to the waters of strife  in  Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And  this is  the south side southward."
26,47,20,"The west side also  shall be  the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath. This  is  the west side."
26,47,21,"So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel."
26,47,22,"And it shall come to pass,  that  ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel."
26,47,23,"And it shall come to pass,  that  in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give  him  his inheritance, saith the Lord"
26,48,1,"Now these  are  the names of the tribes. From the north end to the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are his sides east  and  west; a  portion for  Dan."
26,48,2,"And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a  portion for  Asher."
26,48,3,"And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, a  portion for  Naphtali."
26,48,4,"And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, a  portion for  Manasseh."
26,48,5,"And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the west side, a  portion for  Ephraim."
26,48,6,"And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, a  portion for  Reuben."
26,48,7,"And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, a  portion for  Judah."
26,48,8,"And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and twenty thousand  reeds in  breadth, and  in  length as one of the  other  parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it."
26,48,9,"The oblation that ye shall offer unto the"
26,48,10,"And for them,  even  for the priests, shall be  this  holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand  in length , and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the"

26,48,12,"And  this  oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites."
26,48,13,"And over against the border of the priests the Levites  shall have  five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length  shall be  five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand."
26,48,14,"And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for  it is  holy unto the"
26,48,15,"And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane  place  for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst thereof."
26,48,16,"And these  shall be  the measures thereof; the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred."
26,48,17,"And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty."
26,48,18,"And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy  portion shall be  ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the holy  portion ; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that serve the city."
26,48,19,"And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel."
26,48,20,"All the oblation  shall be  five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city."
26,48,21,"And the residue  shall be  for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house  shall be  in the midst thereof."
26,48,22,"Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city,  being  in the midst  of that  which is the prince’s, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince."

27,1,1,"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it."
27,1,2,"And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god."
27,1,3,"And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring  certain  of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed, and of the princes;"
27,1,4,"Children in whom  was  no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as  had  ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans."
27,1,5,"And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king."
27,1,6,"Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:"
27,1,7,"Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel  the name  of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego."
27,1,8,"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself."
27,1,9,"Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs."
27,1,10,"And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which  are  of your sort? then shall ye make  me  endanger my head to the king."
27,1,11,"Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,"
27,1,12,"Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink."
27,1,13,"Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants."
27,1,14,"So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days."
27,1,15,"And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat."
27,1,16,"Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse."
27,1,17,"As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams."
27,1,18,"Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar."
27,1,19,"And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king."
27,1,20,"And in all matters of wisdom  and  understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians  and  astrologers that  were  in all his realm."
27,1,21,"And Daniel continued  even  unto the first year of king Cyrus."
27,2,1,"And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him."
27,2,2,"Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king."
27,2,3,"And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream."
27,2,4,"Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation."
27,2,5,"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill."
27,2,6,"But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof."
27,2,7,"They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it."
27,2,8,"The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me."
27,2,9,"But if ye will not make known unto me the dream,  there is but  one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof."
27,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore  there is  no king, lord, nor ruler,  that  asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean."
27,2,11,"And  it is  a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."
27,2,12,"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise  men  of Babylon."
27,2,13,"And the decree went forth that the wise  men  should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain."
27,2,14,"Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise  men  of Babylon:"
27,2,15,"He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why  is  the decree  so  hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel."
27,2,16,"Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation."
27,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:"
27,2,18,"That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise  men  of Babylon."
27,2,19,"Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven."
27,2,20,"Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:"
27,2,21,"And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:"
27,2,22,"He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what  is  in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him."
27,2,23,"I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast  now  made known unto us the king’s matter."
27,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise  men  of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise  men  of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation."
27,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation."
27,2,26,"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name  was  Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?"
27,2,27,"Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise  men , the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;"
27,2,28,"But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;"
27,2,29,"As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came  into thy mind  upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass."
27,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for  any  wisdom that I have more than any living, but for  their  sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart."
27,2,31,"Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness  was  excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof  was  terrible."
27,2,32,"This image’s head  was  of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,"
27,2,33,"His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay."
27,2,34,"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet  that were  of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces."
27,2,35,"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
27,2,36,"This  is  the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king."
27,2,37,"Thou, O king,  art  a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory."
27,2,38,"And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou  art  this head of gold."
27,2,39,"And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth."
27,2,40,"And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all  things : and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise."
27,2,41,"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay."
27,2,42,"And  as  the toes of the feet  were  part of iron, and part of clay,  so  the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken."
27,2,43,"And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay."
27,2,44,"And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people,  but  it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever."
27,2,45,"Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream  is  certain, and the interpretation thereof sure."
27,2,46,"Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him."
27,2,47,"The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth  it is , that your God  is  a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret."
27,2,48,"Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise  men  of Babylon."
27,2,49,"Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel  sat  in the gate of the king."
27,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height  was  threescore cubits,  and  the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon."
27,3,2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellers, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
27,3,3,"Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellers, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
27,3,4,"Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,"
27,3,5,"That  at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:"
27,3,6,"And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace."
27,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down  and  worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
27,3,8,"Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews."
27,3,9,"They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever."
27,3,10,"Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:"
27,3,11,"And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth,  that  he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace."
27,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."
27,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in  his  rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king."
27,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them,  Is it  true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?"
27,3,15,"Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made;  well : but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who  is  that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?"
27,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we  are  not careful to answer thee in this matter."
27,3,17,"If it be  so , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver  us  out of thine hand, O king."
27,3,18,"But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."
27,3,19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego:  therefore  he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated."
27,3,20,"And he commanded the most mighty men that  were  in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,  and  to cast  them  into the burning fiery furnace."
27,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their  other  garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
27,3,22,"Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego."
27,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
27,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste,  and  spake, and said unto his counsellers, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king."
27,3,25,"He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God."
27,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace,  and  spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come  hither . Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire."
27,3,27,"And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellers, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them."
27,3,28,"Then  Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed  be  the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."
27,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort."
27,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon."
27,4,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you."
27,4,2,"I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me."
27,4,3,"How great  are  his signs! and how mighty  are  his wonders! his kingdom  is  an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion  is  from generation to generation."
27,4,4,"I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:"
27,4,5,"I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me."
27,4,6,"Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise  men  of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream."
27,4,7,"Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof."
27,4,8,"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name  was  Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom  is  the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream,  saying ,"
27,4,9,"O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods  is  in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof."
27,4,10,"Thus  were  the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof  was  great."
27,4,11,"The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:"
27,4,12,"The leaves thereof  were  fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it  was  meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it."
27,4,13,"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;"
27,4,14,"He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:"
27,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and  let  his portion  be  with the beasts in the grass of the earth:"
27,4,16,"Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him."
27,4,17,"This matter  is  by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men."
27,4,18,"This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise  men  of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou  art  able; for the spirit of the holy gods  is  in thee."
27,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name  was  Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream  be  to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies."
27,4,20,"The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;"
27,4,21,"Whose leaves  were  fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it  was  meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:"
27,4,22,"It  is  thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth."
27,4,23,"And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and  let  his portion  be  with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;"
27,4,24,"This  is  the interpretation, O king, and this  is  the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:"
27,4,25,"That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will."
27,4,26,"And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule."
27,4,27,"Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity."
27,4,28,"All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar."
27,4,29,"At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon."
27,4,30,"The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?"
27,4,31,"While the word  was  in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven,  saying , O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee."
27,4,32,"And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling  shall be  with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will."
27,4,33,"The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles’  feathers , and his nails like birds’  claws ."
27,4,34,"And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion  is  an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom  is  from generation to generation:"
27,4,35,"And all the inhabitants of the earth  are  reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and  among  the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?"
27,4,36,"At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellers and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me."
27,4,37,"Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works  are  truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase."
27,5,1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand."
27,5,2,"Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which  was  in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein."
27,5,3,"Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which  was  at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them."
27,5,4,"They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone."
27,5,5,"In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote."
27,5,6,"Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another."
27,5,7,"The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers.  And  the king spake, and said to the wise  men  of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and  have  a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."
27,5,8,"Then came in all the king’s wise  men : but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof."
27,5,9,"Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied."
27,5,10,"Now  the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house:  and  the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:"
27,5,11,"There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom  is  the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king,  I say , thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans,  and  soothsayers;"
27,5,12,"Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation."
27,5,13,"Then was Daniel brought in before the king.  And  the king spake and said unto Daniel,  Art  thou that Daniel, which  art  of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?"
27,5,14,"I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods  is  in thee, and  that  light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee."
27,5,15,"And now the wise  men , the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:"
27,5,16,"And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and  have  a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom."
27,5,17,"Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation."
27,5,18,"O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:"
27,5,19,"And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down."
27,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:"
27,5,21,"And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling  was  with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and  that  he appointeth over it whomsoever he will."
27,5,22,"And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;"
27,5,23,"But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath  is , and whose  are  all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:"
27,5,24,"Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written."
27,5,25,"And this  is  the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN."
27,5,26,"This  is  the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it."
27,5,27,"TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting."
27,5,28,"PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians."
27,5,29,"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and  put  a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom."
27,5,30,"In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain."
27,5,31,"And Darius the Median took the kingdom,  being  about threescore and two years old."
27,6,1,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;"
27,6,2,"And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel  was  first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage."
27,6,3,"Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit  was  in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm."
27,6,4,"Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he  was  faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him."
27,6,5,"Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find  it  against him concerning the law of his God."
27,6,6,"Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever."
27,6,7,"All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellers, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions."
27,6,8,"Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not."
27,6,9,"Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree."
27,6,10,"Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime."
27,6,11,"Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God."
27,6,12,"Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask  a petition  of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing  is  true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not."
27,6,13,"Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which  is  of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day."
27,6,14,"Then the king, when he heard  these  words, was sore displeased with himself, and set  his  heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him."
27,6,15,"Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians  is , That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed."
27,6,16,"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast  him  into the den of lions.  Now  the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee."
27,6,17,"And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel."
27,6,18,"Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him."
27,6,19,"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions."
27,6,20,"And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel:  and  the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?"
27,6,21,"Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever."
27,6,22,"My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt."
27,6,23,"Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God."
27,6,24,"And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast  them  into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den."
27,6,25,"Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you."
27,6,26,"I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he  is  the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom  that  which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion  shall be even  unto the end."
27,6,27,"He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions."
27,6,28,"So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian."
27,7,1,"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream,  and  told the sum of the matters."
27,7,2,"Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea."
27,7,3,"And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another."
27,7,4,"The first  was  like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it."
27,7,5,"And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and  it had  three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh."
27,7,6,"After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it."
27,7,7,"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it  was  diverse from all the beasts that  were  before it; and it had ten horns."
27,7,8,"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn  were  eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things."
27,7,9,"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment  was  white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne  was like  the fiery flame,  and  his wheels  as  burning fire."
27,7,10,"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."
27,7,11,"I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld  even  till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame."
27,7,12,"As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time."
27,7,13,"I saw in the night visions, and, behold,  one  like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him."
27,7,14,"And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion  is  an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom  that  which shall not be destroyed."
27,7,15,"I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of  my  body, and the visions of my head troubled me."
27,7,16,"I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things."
27,7,17,"These great beasts, which are four,  are  four kings,  which  shall arise out of the earth."
27,7,18,"But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever."
27,7,19,"Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth  were of  iron, and his nails  of  brass;  which  devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;"
27,7,20,"And of the ten horns that  were  in his head, and  of  the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even  of  that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look  was  more stout than his fellows."
27,7,21,"I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;"
27,7,22,"Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom."
27,7,23,"Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces."
27,7,24,"And the ten horns out of this kingdom  are  ten kings  that  shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings."
27,7,25,"And he shall speak  great  words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time."
27,7,26,"But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy  it  unto the end."
27,7,27,"And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom  is  an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him."
27,7,28,"Hitherto  is  the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart."
27,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me,  even unto  me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first."
27,8,2,"And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I  was  at Shushan  in  the palace, which  is  in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai."
27,8,3,"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had  two  horns: and the  two  horns  were  high; but one  was  higher than the other, and the higher came up last."
27,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither  was there any  that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great."
27,8,5,"And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat  had  a notable horn between his eyes."
27,8,6,"And he came to the ram that had  two  horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power."
27,8,7,"And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand."
27,8,8,"Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."
27,8,9,"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant  land ."
27,8,10,"And it waxed great,  even  to the host of heaven; and it cast down  some  of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them."
27,8,11,"Yea, he magnified  himself  even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily  sacrifice  was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down."
27,8,12,"And an host was given  him  against the daily  sacrifice  by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered."
27,8,13,"Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain  saint  which spake, How long  shall be  the vision  concerning  the daily  sacrifice , and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?"
27,8,14,"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."
27,8,15,"And it came to pass, when I,  even  I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man."
27,8,16,"And I heard a man’s voice between  the banks of  Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this  man  to understand the vision."
27,8,17,"So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end  shall be  the vision."
27,8,18,"Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright."
27,8,19,"And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end  shall be ."
27,8,20,"The ram which thou sawest having  two  horns  are  the kings of Media and Persia."
27,8,21,"And the rough goat  is  the king of Grecia: and the great horn that  is  between his eyes  is  the first king."
27,8,22,"Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power."
27,8,23,"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up."
27,8,24,"And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people."
27,8,25,"And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify  himself  in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand."
27,8,26,"And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told  is  true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it  shall be  for many days."
27,8,27,"And I Daniel fainted, and was sick  certain  days; afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood  it ."
27,9,1,"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;"
27,9,2,"In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the"
27,9,3,"And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:"
27,9,4,"And I prayed unto the"
27,9,5,"We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:"
27,9,6,"Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land."
27,9,7,"O Lord, righteousness  belongeth  unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel,  that are  near, and  that are  far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee."
27,9,8,"O Lord, to us  belongeth  confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee."
27,9,9,"To the Lord our God  belong  mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;"
27,9,10,"Neither have we obeyed the voice of the"
27,9,11,"Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that  is  written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him."
27,9,12,"And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem."
27,9,13,"As  it is  written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the"
27,9,14,"Therefore hath the"
27,9,15,"And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly."
27,9,16,"O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people  are become  a reproach to all  that are  about us."
27,9,17,"Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake."
27,9,18,"O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies."
27,9,19,"O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name."
27,9,20,"And whiles I  was  speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the"
27,9,21,"Yea, whiles I  was  speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation."
27,9,22,"And he informed  me , and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding."
27,9,23,"At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew  thee ; for thou  art  greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision."
27,9,24,"Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy."
27,9,25,"Know therefore and understand,  that  from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince  shall be  seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times."
27,9,26,"And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof  shall be  with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined."
27,9,27,"And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make  it  desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate."
27,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing  was  true, but the time appointed  was  long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision."
27,10,2,"In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks."
27,10,3,"I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled."
27,10,4,"And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which  is  Hiddekel;"
27,10,5,"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins  were  girded with fine gold of Uphaz:"
27,10,6,"His body also  was  like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude."
27,10,7,"And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves."
27,10,8,"Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength."
27,10,9,"Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground."
27,10,10,"And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and  upon  the palms of my hands."
27,10,11,"And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling."
27,10,12,"Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words."
27,10,13,"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia."
27,10,14,"Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision  is  for  many  days."
27,10,15,"And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb."
27,10,16,"And, behold,  one  like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength."
27,10,17,"For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me."
27,10,18,"Then there came again and touched me  one  like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,"
27,10,19,"And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace  be  unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me."
27,10,20,"Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come."
27,10,21,"But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and  there is  none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince."
27,11,1,"Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede,  even  I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him."
27,11,2,"And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than  they  all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia."
27,11,3,"And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will."
27,11,4,"And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those."
27,11,5,"And the king of the south shall be strong, and  one  of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion  shall be  a great dominion."
27,11,6,"And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in  these  times."
27,11,7,"But out of a branch of her roots shall  one  stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:"
27,11,8,"And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes,  and  with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue  more  years than the king of the north."
27,11,9,"So the king of the south shall come into  his  kingdom, and shall return into his own land."
27,11,10,"But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and  one  shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up,  even  to his fortress."
27,11,11,"And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him,  even  with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand."
27,11,12,"And  when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down  many  ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened  by it ."
27,11,13,"For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches."
27,11,14,"And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall."
27,11,15,"So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither  shall there be any  strength to withstand."
27,11,16,"But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed."
27,11,17,"He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand  on his side , neither be for him."
27,11,18,"After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause  it  to turn upon him."
27,11,19,"Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found."
27,11,20,"Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes  in  the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle."
27,11,21,"And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries."
27,11,22,"And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant."
27,11,23,"And after the league  made  with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people."
27,11,24,"He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do  that  which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches:  yea , and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time."
27,11,25,"And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him."
27,11,26,"Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain."
27,11,27,"And both these kings’ hearts  shall be  to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end  shall be  at the time appointed."
27,11,28,"Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart  shall be  against the holy covenant; and he shall do  exploits , and return to his own land."
27,11,29,"At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter."
27,11,30,"For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant."
27,11,31,"And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily  sacrifice , and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate."
27,11,32,"And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do  exploits ."
27,11,33,"And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil,  many  days."
27,11,34,"Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries."
27,11,35,"And  some  of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make  them  white,  even  to the time of the end: because  it is  yet for a time appointed."
27,11,36,"And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done."
27,11,37,"Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all."
27,11,38,"But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things."
27,11,39,"Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge  and  increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain."
27,11,40,"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over."
27,11,41,"He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many  countries  shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand,  even  Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon."
27,11,42,"He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape."
27,11,43,"But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians  shall be  at his steps."
27,11,44,"But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many."
27,11,45,"And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him."
27,12,1,"And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation  even  to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book."
27,12,2,"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame  and  everlasting contempt."
27,12,3,"And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever."
27,12,4,"But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book,  even  to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."
27,12,5,"Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river."
27,12,6,"And  one  said to the man clothed in linen, which  was  upon the waters of the river, How long  shall it be to  the end of these wonders?"
27,12,7,"And I heard the man clothed in linen, which  was  upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that  it shall be  for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these  things  shall be finished."
27,12,8,"And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what  shall be  the end of these  things ?"
27,12,9,"And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words  are  closed up and sealed till the time of the end."
27,12,10,"Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand."
27,12,11,"And from the time  that  the daily  sacrifice  shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up,  there shall be  a thousand two hundred and ninety days."
27,12,12,"Blessed  is  he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days."
27,12,13,"But go thou thy way till the end  be : for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days."

28,1,4,"And the"
28,1,5,"And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel."
28,1,6,"And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And  God  said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away."
28,1,7,"But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the"
28,1,8,"Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son."
28,1,9,"Then said  God , Call his name Loammi: for ye  are  not my people, and I will not be your  God ."
28,1,10,"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass,  that  in the place where it was said unto them, Ye  are  not my people,  there  it shall be said unto them,  Ye are  the sons of the living God."
28,1,11,"Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great  shall be  the day of Jezreel."
28,2,1,"Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah."
28,2,2,"Plead with your mother, plead: for she  is  not my wife, neither  am  I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;"
28,2,3,"Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst."
28,2,4,"And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they  be  the children of whoredoms."
28,2,5,"For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give  me  my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink."
28,2,6,"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths."
28,2,7,"And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find  them : then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then  was it  better with me than now."
28,2,8,"For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold,  which  they prepared for Baal."
28,2,9,"Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax  given  to cover her nakedness."
28,2,10,"And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand."
28,2,11,"I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts."
28,2,12,"And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These  are  my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them."
28,2,13,"And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the"
28,2,14,"Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her."
28,2,15,"And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt."
28,2,16,"And it shall be at that day, saith the"
28,2,17,"For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name."
28,2,18,"And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and  with  the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely."
28,2,19,"And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies."
28,2,20,"I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the"
28,2,21,"And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the"

28,2,23,"And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to  them which were  not my people, Thou  art  my people; and they shall say,  Thou art  my God."

28,3,3,"And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for  another  man: so  will  I also  be  for thee."
28,3,4,"For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and  without  teraphim:"
28,3,5,"Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the"

28,4,3,"Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away."
28,4,4,"Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people  are  as they that strive with the priest."
28,4,5,"Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother."
28,4,6,"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children."
28,4,7,"As they were increased, so they sinned against me:  therefore  will I change their glory into shame."
28,4,8,"They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity."
28,4,9,"And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings."
28,4,10,"For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the"
28,4,11,"Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart."
28,4,12,"My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused  them  to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God."
28,4,13,"They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof  is  good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery."
28,4,14,"I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people  that  doth not understand shall fall."
28,4,15,"Though thou, Israel, play the harlot,  yet  let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The"
28,4,16,"For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the"
28,4,17,"Ephraim  is  joined to idols: let him alone."
28,4,18,"Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers  with  shame do love, Give ye."
28,4,19,"The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices."
28,5,1,"Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment  is  toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor."
28,5,2,"And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I  have been  a rebuker of them all."
28,5,3,"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom,  and  Israel is defiled."
28,5,4,"They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms  is  in the midst of them, and they have not known the"
28,5,5,"And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them."
28,5,6,"They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the"
28,5,7,"They have dealt treacherously against the"
28,5,8,"Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah,  and  the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud  at  Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin."
28,5,9,"Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be."
28,5,10,"The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:  therefore  I will pour out my wrath upon them like water."
28,5,11,"Ephraim  is  oppressed  and  broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment."
28,5,12,"Therefore  will  I  be  unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness."
28,5,13,"When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah  saw  his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound."
28,5,14,"For I  will be  unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I,  even  I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue  him ."
28,5,15,"I will go  and  return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early."
28,6,1,"Come, and let us return unto the"
28,6,2,"After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight."
28,6,3,"Then shall we know,  if  we follow on to know the"
28,6,4,"O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness  is  as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away."
28,6,5,"Therefore have I hewed  them  by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments  are as  the light  that  goeth forth."
28,6,6,"For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings."
28,6,7,"But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me."
28,6,8,"Gilead  is  a city of them that work iniquity,  and is  polluted with blood."
28,6,9,"And as troops of robbers wait for a man,  so  the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness."
28,6,10,"I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there  is  the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled."
28,6,11,"Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people."
28,7,1,"When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in,  and  the troop of robbers spoileth without."
28,7,2,"And they consider not in their hearts  that  I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face."
28,7,3,"They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies."
28,7,4,"They  are  all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker,  who  ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened."
28,7,5,"In the day of our king the princes have made  him  sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners."
28,7,6,"For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire."
28,7,7,"They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen:  there is  none among them that calleth unto me."
28,7,8,"Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned."
28,7,9,"Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth  it  not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not."
28,7,10,"And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the"
28,7,11,"Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria."
28,7,12,"When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard."
28,7,13,"Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me."
28,7,14,"And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine,  and  they rebel against me."
28,7,15,"Though I have bound  and  strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me."
28,7,16,"They return,  but  not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this  shall be  their derision in the land of Egypt."
28,8,1,"Set  the trumpet to thy mouth.  He shall come  as an eagle against the house of the"
28,8,2,"Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee."
28,8,3,"Israel hath cast off  the thing that is  good: the enemy shall pursue him."
28,8,4,"They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew  it  not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off."
28,8,5,"Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast  thee  off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long  will it be  ere they attain to innocency?"
28,8,6,"For from Israel  was  it also: the workman made it; therefore it  is  not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces."
28,8,7,"For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up."
28,8,8,"Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein  is  no pleasure."
28,8,9,"For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers."
28,8,10,"Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes."
28,8,11,"Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin."
28,8,12,"I have written to him the great things of my law,  but  they were counted as a strange thing."
28,8,13,"They sacrifice flesh  for  the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat  it; but  the"
28,8,14,"For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof."
28,9,1,"Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as  other  people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor."
28,9,2,"The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her."
28,9,3,"They shall not dwell in the"
28,9,4,"They shall not offer wine  offerings  to the"
28,9,5,"What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the"
28,9,6,"For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant  places  for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns  shall be  in their tabernacles."
28,9,7,"The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know  it : the prophet  is  a fool, the spiritual man  is  mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred."
28,9,8,"The watchman of Ephraim  was  with my God:  but  the prophet  is  a snare of a fowler in all his ways,  and  hatred in the house of his God."
28,9,9,"They have deeply corrupted  themselves , as in the days of Gibeah:  therefore  he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins."
28,9,10,"I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time:  but  they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto  that  shame; and  their  abominations were according as they loved."
28,9,11,"As for  Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception."
28,9,12,"Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them,  that there shall  not  be  a man  left : yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!"
28,9,13,"Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus,  is  planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer."
28,9,14,"Give them, O"
28,9,15,"All their wickedness  is  in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes  are  revolters."
28,9,16,"Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay  even  the beloved  fruit  of their womb."
28,9,17,"My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations."
28,10,1,"Israel  is  an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images."
28,10,2,"Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images."
28,10,3,"For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the"
28,10,4,"They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field."
28,10,5,"The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof  that  rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it."
28,10,6,"It shall be also carried unto Assyria  for  a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel."
28,10,7,"As for  Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water."
28,10,8,"The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us."
28,10,9,"O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them."
28,10,10,"It is  in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows."
28,10,11,"And Ephraim  is as  an heifer  that is  taught,  and  loveth to tread out  the corn ; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow,  and  Jacob shall break his clods."
28,10,12,"Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for  it is  time to seek the"
28,10,13,"Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men."
28,10,14,"Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon  her  children."
28,10,15,"So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off."
28,11,1,"When Israel  was  a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt."
28,11,2,"As  they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images."
28,11,3,"I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them."
28,11,4,"I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them."
28,11,5,"He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return."
28,11,6,"And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour  them , because of their own counsels."
28,11,7,"And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt  him ."
28,11,8,"How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?  how  shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah?  how  shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together."
28,11,9,"I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I  am  God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city."
28,11,10,"They shall walk after the"

30,7,11,"For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land."
30,7,12,"Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:"
30,7,13,"But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it  is  the king’s chapel, and it  is  the king’s court."
30,7,14,"Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I  was  no prophet, neither  was  I a prophet’s son; but I  was  an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:"
30,7,15,"And the"
30,7,16,"Now therefore hear thou the word of the"

30,8,3,"And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord"
30,8,4,"Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,"
30,8,5,"Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?"
30,8,6,"That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes;  yea , and sell the refuse of the wheat?"
30,8,7,"The"
30,8,8,"Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as  by  the flood of Egypt."
30,8,9,"And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord"
30,8,10,"And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only  son , and the end thereof as a bitter day."
30,8,11,"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord"
30,8,12,"And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the"
30,8,13,"In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst."
30,8,14,"They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again."
30,9,1,"I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered."
30,9,2,"Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:"
30,9,3,"And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:"
30,9,4,"And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good."
30,9,5,"And the Lord"
30,9,6,"It is  he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The"
30,9,7,"Are  ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the"
30,9,8,"Behold, the eyes of the Lord"
30,9,9,"For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as  corn  is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth."
30,9,10,"All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us."
30,9,11,"In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:"
30,9,12,"That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the"
30,9,13,"Behold, the days come, saith the"
30,9,14,"And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit  them ; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them."
30,9,15,"And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the"
31,1,1,"The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord"
31,1,2,"Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised."
31,1,3,"The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation  is  high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?"
31,1,4,"Though thou exalt  thyself  as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the"
31,1,5,"If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave  some  grapes?"
31,1,6,"How are  the things  of Esau searched out!  how  are his hidden things sought up!"
31,1,7,"All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee  even  to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee,  and  prevailed against thee;  they that eat  thy bread have laid a wound under thee:  there is  none understanding in him."
31,1,8,"Shall I not in that day, saith the"
31,1,9,"And thy mighty  men , O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter."
31,1,10,"For  thy  violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever."
31,1,11,"In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou  wast  as one of them."
31,1,12,"But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress."
31,1,13,"Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid  hands  on their substance in the day of their calamity;"
31,1,14,"Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress."
31,1,15,"For the day of the"
31,1,16,"For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain,  so  shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been."
31,1,17,"But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions."
31,1,18,"And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be  any  remaining of the house of Esau; for the"
31,1,19,"And  they of  the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and  they of  the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin  shall possess  Gilead."
31,1,20,"And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel  shall possess  that of the Canaanites,  even  unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which  is  in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south."

32,1,3,"But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the"
32,1,4,"But the"
32,1,5,"Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that  were  in the ship into the sea, to lighten  it  of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep."
32,1,6,"So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not."
32,1,7,"And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil  is  upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah."
32,1,8,"Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil  is  upon us; What  is  thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what  is  thy country? and of what people  art  thou?"
32,1,9,"And he said unto them, I  am  an Hebrew; and I fear the"
32,1,10,"Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the"
32,1,11,"Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous."
32,1,12,"And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest  is  upon you."
32,1,13,"Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring  it  to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them."
32,1,14,"Wherefore they cried unto the"
32,1,15,"So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging."
32,1,16,"Then the men feared the"

32,2,1,"Then Jonah prayed unto the"
32,2,2,"And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the"

32,2,4,"Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple."
32,2,5,"The waters compassed me about,  even  to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head."
32,2,6,"I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars  was  about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O"
32,2,7,"When my soul fainted within me I remembered the"

32,3,3,"So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the"
32,3,4,"And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown."
32,3,5,"So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them."
32,3,6,"For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered  him  with sackcloth, and sat in ashes."
32,3,7,"And he caused  it  to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:"
32,3,8,"But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that  is  in their hands."
32,3,9,"Who can tell  if  God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?"
32,3,10,"And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did  it  not."
32,4,1,"But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry."
32,4,2,"And he prayed unto the"
32,4,3,"Therefore now, O"
32,4,4,"Then said the"
32,4,5,"So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city."
32,4,6,"And the"
32,4,7,"But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered."
32,4,8,"And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said,  It is  better for me to die than to live."
32,4,9,"And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry,  even  unto death."
32,4,10,"Then said the"
32,4,11,"And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and  also  much cattle?"
33,1,1,"The word of the"
33,1,2,"Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord"
33,1,3,"For, behold, the"

33,1,5,"For the transgression of Jacob  is  all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What  is  the transgression of Jacob?  is it  not Samaria? and what  are  the high places of Judah?  are they  not Jerusalem?"
33,1,6,"Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field,  and  as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof."
33,1,7,"And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered  it  of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot."
33,1,8,"Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls."
33,1,9,"For her wound  is  incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people,  even  to Jerusalem."
33,1,10,"Declare ye  it  not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust."
33,1,11,"Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing."
33,1,12,"For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the"
33,1,13,"O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she  is  the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee."
33,1,14,"Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib  shall be  a lie to the kings of Israel."
33,1,15,"Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel."

33,2,1,"Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand."
33,2,2,"And they covet fields, and take  them  by violence; and houses, and take  them  away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage."
33,2,3,"Therefore thus saith the"

33,2,10,"Arise ye, and depart; for this  is  not  your  rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy  you , even with a sore destruction."
33,2,11,"If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie,  saying , I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people."
33,2,12,"I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of  the multitude of  men."

33,3,3,"Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron."
33,3,4,"Then shall they cry unto the"

38,1,19,"And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What  be  these? And he answered me, These  are  the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem."
38,1,20,"And the"
38,1,21,"Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These  are  the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up  their  horn over the land of Judah to scatter it."
38,2,1,"I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand."
38,2,2,"Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what  is  the breadth thereof, and what  is  the length thereof."
38,2,3,"And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,"
38,2,4,"And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited  as  towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:"
38,2,5,"For I, saith the"

38,3,3,"Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel."
38,3,4,"And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment."
38,3,5,"And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the"
38,3,6,"And the angel of the"
38,3,7,"Thus saith the"
38,3,8,"Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they  are  men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH."
38,3,9,"For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone  shall be  seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the"

38,4,1,"And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,"
38,4,2,"And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all  of  gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which  are  upon the top thereof:"
38,4,3,"And two olive trees by it, one upon the right  side  of the bowl, and the other upon the left  side  thereof."
38,4,4,"So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What  are  these, my lord?"
38,4,5,"Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord."
38,4,6,"Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This  is  the word of the"
38,4,7,"Who  art  thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel  thou shalt become  a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone  thereof with  shoutings,  crying , Grace, grace unto it."
38,4,8,"Moreover the word of the"

38,4,12,"And I answered again, and said unto him, What  be these  two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden  oil  out of themselves?"
38,4,13,"And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these  be ? And I said, No, my lord."
38,4,14,"Then said he, These  are  the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth."
38,5,1,"Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll."
38,5,2,"And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof  is  twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits."
38,5,3,"Then said he unto me, This  is  the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off  as  on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off  as  on that side according to it."
38,5,4,"I will bring it forth, saith the"
38,5,5,"Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what  is  this that goeth forth."
38,5,6,"And I said, What  is  it? And he said, This  is  an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This  is  their resemblance through all the earth."
38,5,7,"And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this  is  a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah."
38,5,8,"And he said, This  is  wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof."
38,5,9,"Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind  was  in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven."
38,5,10,"Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?"
38,5,11,"And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base."
38,6,1,"And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains  were  mountains of brass."
38,6,2,"In the first chariot  were  red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;"
38,6,3,"And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses."
38,6,4,"Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What  are  these, my lord?"
38,6,5,"And the angel answered and said unto me, These  are  the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth."
38,6,6,"The black horses which  are  therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country."
38,6,7,"And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth."
38,6,8,"Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country."
38,6,9,"And the word of the"
38,6,10,"Take of  them of  the captivity,  even  of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;"
38,6,11,"Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set  them  upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;"
38,6,12,"And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the"

38,7,5,"Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh  month , even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me,  even  to me?"
38,7,6,"And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat  for yourselves , and drink  for yourselves ?"
38,7,7,"Should ye  not  hear  the words which the"

38,7,11,"But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear."
38,7,12,"Yea, they made their hearts  as  an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the"

39,2,7,"For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he  is  the messenger of the"
39,2,8,"But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the"
39,2,9,"Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law."
39,2,10,"Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?"
39,2,11,"Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the"
39,2,12,"The"
39,2,13,"And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the"

39,2,15,"And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth."
39,2,16,"For the"

39,3,2,"But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he  is  like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap:"
39,3,3,"And he shall sit  as  a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the"
39,3,4,"Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the"
39,3,5,"And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in  his  wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger  from his right , and fear not me, saith the"
39,3,6,"For I  am  the"

39,3,8,"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings."
39,3,9,"Ye  are  cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me,  even  this whole nation."
39,3,10,"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the"
39,3,11,"And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the"

39,3,13,"Your words have been stout against me, saith the"

39,3,16,"Then they that feared the"

39,4,3,"And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do  this , saith the"
39,4,4,"Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel,  with  the statutes and judgments."
39,4,5,"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the"

40,1,1,"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
40,1,2,"Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;"
40,1,3,"And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;"
40,1,4,"And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;"
40,1,5,"And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;"
40,1,6,"And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her  that had been the wife  of Urias;"
40,1,7,"And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;"
40,1,8,"And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;"
40,1,9,"And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;"
40,1,10,"And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;"
40,1,11,"And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:"
40,1,12,"And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;"
40,1,13,"And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;"
40,1,14,"And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;"
40,1,15,"And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;"
40,1,16,"And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."
40,1,17,"So all the generations from Abraham to David  are  fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon  are  fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ  are  fourteen generations."
40,1,18,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost."
40,1,19,"Then Joseph her husband, being a just  man , and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily."
40,1,20,"But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost."
40,1,21,"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins."
40,1,22,"Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,"
40,1,23,"Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us."
40,1,24,"Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:"
40,1,25,"And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS."
40,2,1,"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,"
40,2,2,"Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him."
40,2,3,"When Herod the king had heard  these things , he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him."
40,2,4,"And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born."
40,2,5,"And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,"
40,2,6,"And thou Bethlehem,  in  the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel."
40,2,7,"Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared."
40,2,8,"And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found  him , bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also."
40,2,9,"When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was."
40,2,10,"When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy."
40,2,11,"And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh."
40,2,12,"And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way."
40,2,13,"And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
40,2,14,"When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:"
40,2,15,"And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son."
40,2,16,"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men."
40,2,17,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,"
40,2,18,"In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping  for  her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not."
40,2,19,"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,"
40,2,20,"Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child’s life."
40,2,21,"And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel."
40,2,22,"But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:"
40,2,23,"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene."
40,3,1,"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,"
40,3,2,"And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
40,3,3,"For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
40,3,4,"And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey."
40,3,5,"Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,"
40,3,6,"And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins."
40,3,7,"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
40,3,8,"Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:"
40,3,9,"And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to  our  father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham."
40,3,10,"And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
40,3,11,"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and  with  fire:"
40,3,12,"Whose fan  is  in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
40,3,13,"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him."
40,3,14,"But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?"
40,3,15,"And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer  it to be so  now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him."
40,3,16,"And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:"
40,3,17,"And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
40,4,1,"Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil."
40,4,2,"And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred."
40,4,3,"And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread."
40,4,4,"But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."
40,4,5,"Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,"
40,4,6,"And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in  their  hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone."
40,4,7,"Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."
40,4,8,"Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;"
40,4,9,"And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me."
40,4,10,"Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."
40,4,11,"Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him."
40,4,12,"Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;"
40,4,13,"And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:"
40,4,14,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,"
40,4,15,"The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim,  by  the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;"
40,4,16,"The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up."
40,4,17,"From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
40,4,18,"And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers."
40,4,19,"And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
40,4,20,"And they straightway left  their  nets, and followed him."
40,4,21,"And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James  the son  of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them."
40,4,22,"And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him."
40,4,23,"And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people."
40,4,24,"And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them."
40,4,25,"And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and  from  Decapolis, and  from  Jerusalem, and  from  Judaea, and  from  beyond Jordan."
40,5,1,"And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:"
40,5,2,"And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,"
40,5,3,"Blessed  are  the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
40,5,4,"Blessed  are  they that mourn: for they shall be comforted."
40,5,5,"Blessed  are  the meek: for they shall inherit the earth."
40,5,6,"Blessed  are  they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled."
40,5,7,"Blessed  are  the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy."
40,5,8,"Blessed  are  the pure in heart: for they shall see God."
40,5,9,"Blessed  are  the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God."
40,5,10,"Blessed  are  they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
40,5,11,"Blessed are ye, when  men  shall revile you, and persecute  you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake."
40,5,12,"Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great  is  your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you."
40,5,13,"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men."
40,5,14,"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid."
40,5,15,"Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house."
40,5,16,"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."
40,5,17,"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."
40,5,18,"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."
40,5,19,"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach  them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
40,5,20,"For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed  the righteousness  of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."
40,5,21,"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:"
40,5,22,"But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire."
40,5,23,"Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;"
40,5,24,"Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift."
40,5,25,"Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison."
40,5,26,"Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing."
40,5,27,"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:"
40,5,28,"But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."
40,5,29,"And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast  it  from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not  that  thy whole body should be cast into hell."
40,5,30,"And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast  it  from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not  that  thy whole body should be cast into hell."
40,5,31,"It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:"
40,5,32,"But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery."
40,5,33,"Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:"
40,5,34,"But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:"
40,5,35,"Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King."
40,5,36,"Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black."
40,5,37,"But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil."
40,5,38,"Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:"
40,5,39,"But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also."
40,5,40,"And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have  thy  cloke also."
40,5,41,"And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain."
40,5,42,"Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away."
40,5,43,"Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy."
40,5,44,"But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;"
40,5,45,"That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."
40,5,46,"For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?"
40,5,47,"And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more  than others ? do not even the publicans so?"
40,5,48,"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."
40,6,1,"Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven."
40,6,2,"Therefore when thou doest  thine  alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward."
40,6,3,"But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:"
40,6,4,"That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly."
40,6,5,"And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites  are : for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward."
40,6,6,"But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly."
40,6,7,"But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen  do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking."
40,6,8,"Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him."
40,6,9,"After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name."
40,6,10,"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as  it is  in heaven."
40,6,11,"Give us this day our daily bread."
40,6,12,"And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."
40,6,13,"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen."
40,6,14,"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:"
40,6,15,"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
40,6,16,"Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward."
40,6,17,"But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;"
40,6,18,"That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly."
40,6,19,"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:"
40,6,20,"But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:"
40,6,21,"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
40,6,22,"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light."
40,6,23,"But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great  is  that darkness!"
40,6,24,"No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."
40,6,25,"Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?"
40,6,26,"Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?"
40,6,27,"Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?"
40,6,28,"And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:"
40,6,29,"And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
40,6,30,"Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven,  shall he  not much more  clothe  you, O ye of little faith?"
40,6,31,"Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?"
40,6,32,"(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things."
40,6,33,"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."
40,6,34,"Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day  is  the evil thereof."
40,7,1,"Judge not, that ye be not judged."
40,7,2,"For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again."
40,7,3,"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"
40,7,4,"Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam  is  in thine own eye?"
40,7,5,"Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye."
40,7,6,"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you."
40,7,7,"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:"
40,7,8,"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."
40,7,9,"Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?"
40,7,10,"Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?"
40,7,11,"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?"
40,7,12,"Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets."
40,7,13,"Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide  is  the gate, and broad  is  the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:"
40,7,14,"Because strait  is  the gate, and narrow  is  the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it."
40,7,15,"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves."
40,7,16,"Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?"
40,7,17,"Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit."
40,7,18,"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither  can  a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit."
40,7,19,"Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
40,7,20,"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them."
40,7,21,"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven."
40,7,22,"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?"
40,7,23,"And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
40,7,24,"Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:"
40,7,25,"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock."
40,7,26,"And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:"
40,7,27,"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it."
40,7,28,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:"
40,7,29,"For he taught them as  one  having authority, and not as the scribes."
40,8,1,"When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him."
40,8,2,"And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."
40,8,3,"And Jesus put forth  his  hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed."
40,8,4,"And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them."
40,8,5,"And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,"
40,8,6,"And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented."
40,8,7,"And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him."
40,8,8,"The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed."
40,8,9,"For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this  man , Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth  it ."
40,8,10,"When Jesus heard  it , he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."
40,8,11,"And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven."
40,8,12,"But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40,8,13,"And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed,  so  be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour."
40,8,14,"And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a fever."
40,8,15,"And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them."
40,8,16,"When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with  his  word, and healed all that were sick:"
40,8,17,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare  our  sicknesses."
40,8,18,"Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side."
40,8,19,"And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest."
40,8,20,"And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air  have  nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay  his  head."
40,8,21,"And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father."
40,8,22,"But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead."
40,8,23,"And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him."
40,8,24,"And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep."
40,8,25,"And his disciples came to  him , and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish."
40,8,26,"And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm."
40,8,27,"But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!"
40,8,28,"And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way."
40,8,29,"And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?"
40,8,30,"And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding."
40,8,31,"So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine."
40,8,32,"And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters."
40,8,33,"And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils."
40,8,34,"And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought  him  that he would depart out of their coasts."
40,9,1,"And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city."
40,9,2,"And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee."
40,9,3,"And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This  man  blasphemeth."
40,9,4,"And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?"
40,9,5,"For whether is easier, to say,  Thy  sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?"
40,9,6,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house."
40,9,7,"And he arose, and departed to his house."
40,9,8,"But when the multitudes saw  it , they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men."
40,9,9,"And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him."
40,9,10,"And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples."
40,9,11,"And when the Pharisees saw  it , they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?"
40,9,12,"But when Jesus heard  that , he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick."
40,9,13,"But go ye and learn what  that  meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
40,9,14,"Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?"
40,9,15,"And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast."
40,9,16,"No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse."
40,9,17,"Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved."
40,9,18,"While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live."
40,9,19,"And Jesus arose, and followed him, and  so did  his disciples."
40,9,20,"And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind  him , and touched the hem of his garment:"
40,9,21,"For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole."
40,9,22,"But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour."
40,9,23,"And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,"
40,9,24,"He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn."
40,9,25,"But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose."
40,9,26,"And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land."
40,9,27,"And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying,  Thou  Son of David, have mercy on us."
40,9,28,"And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord."
40,9,29,"Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you."
40,9,30,"And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See  that  no man know  it ."
40,9,31,"But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country."
40,9,32,"As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil."
40,9,33,"And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel."
40,9,34,"But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils."
40,9,35,"And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people."
40,9,36,"But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd."
40,9,37,"Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly  is  plenteous, but the labourers  are  few;"
40,9,38,"Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest."
40,10,1,"And when he had called unto  him  his twelve disciples, he gave them power  against  unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease."
40,10,2,"Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James  the son  of Zebedee, and John his brother;"
40,10,3,"Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James  the son  of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;"
40,10,4,"Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him."
40,10,5,"These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into  any  city of the Samaritans enter ye not:"
40,10,6,"But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
40,10,7,"And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand."
40,10,8,"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give."
40,10,9,"Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,"
40,10,10,"Nor scrip for  your  journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat."
40,10,11,"And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence."
40,10,12,"And when ye come into an house, salute it."
40,10,13,"And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you."
40,10,14,"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet."
40,10,15,"Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city."
40,10,16,"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves."
40,10,17,"But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;"
40,10,18,"And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles."
40,10,19,"But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak."
40,10,20,"For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you."
40,10,21,"And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against  their  parents, and cause them to be put to death."
40,10,22,"And ye shall be hated of all  men  for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved."
40,10,23,"But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come."
40,10,24,"The disciple is not above  his  master, nor the servant above his lord."
40,10,25,"It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more  shall they call  them of his household?"
40,10,26,"Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known."
40,10,27,"What I tell you in darkness,  that  speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear,  that  preach ye upon the housetops."
40,10,28,"And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
40,10,29,"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father."
40,10,30,"But the very hairs of your head are all numbered."
40,10,31,"Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows."
40,10,32,"Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven."
40,10,33,"But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven."
40,10,34,"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword."
40,10,35,"For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."
40,10,36,"And a man’s foes  shall be  they of his own household."
40,10,37,"He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
40,10,38,"And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me."
40,10,39,"He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it."
40,10,40,"He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me."
40,10,41,"He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward."
40,10,42,"And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold  water  only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward."
40,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities."
40,11,2,"Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,"
40,11,3,"And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?"
40,11,4,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:"
40,11,5,"The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them."
40,11,6,"And blessed is  he , whosoever shall not be offended in me."
40,11,7,"And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?"
40,11,8,"But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft  clothing  are in kings’ houses."
40,11,9,"But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet."
40,11,10,"For this is  he , of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee."
40,11,11,"Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
40,11,12,"And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force."
40,11,13,"For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John."
40,11,14,"And if ye will receive  it , this is Elias, which was for to come."
40,11,15,"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
40,11,16,"But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,"
40,11,17,"And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented."
40,11,18,"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil."
40,11,19,"The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children."
40,11,20,"Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:"
40,11,21,"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
40,11,22,"But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you."
40,11,23,"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day."
40,11,24,"But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee."
40,11,25,"At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes."
40,11,26,"Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight."
40,11,27,"All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and  he  to whomsoever the Son will reveal  him ."
40,11,28,"Come unto me, all  ye  that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
40,11,29,"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls."
40,11,30,"For my yoke  is  easy, and my burden is light."
40,12,1,"At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat."
40,12,2,"But when the Pharisees saw  it , they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day."
40,12,3,"But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;"
40,12,4,"How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?"
40,12,5,"Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?"
40,12,6,"But I say unto you, That in this place is  one  greater than the temple."
40,12,7,"But if ye had known what  this  meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless."
40,12,8,"For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day."
40,12,9,"And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:"
40,12,10,"And, behold, there was a man which had  his  hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him."
40,12,11,"And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift  it  out?"
40,12,12,"How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days."
40,12,13,"Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched  it  forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other."
40,12,14,"Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him."
40,12,15,"But when Jesus knew  it , he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;"
40,12,16,"And charged them that they should not make him known:"
40,12,17,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,"
40,12,18,"Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles."
40,12,19,"He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets."
40,12,20,"A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory."
40,12,21,"And in his name shall the Gentiles trust."
40,12,22,"Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw."
40,12,23,"And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?"
40,12,24,"But when the Pharisees heard  it , they said, This  fellow  doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils."
40,12,25,"And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:"
40,12,26,"And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?"
40,12,27,"And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast  them  out? therefore they shall be your judges."
40,12,28,"But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you."
40,12,29,"Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house."
40,12,30,"He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad."
40,12,31,"Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy  against  the  Holy  Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men."
40,12,32,"And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the  world  to come."
40,12,33,"Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by  his  fruit."
40,12,34,"O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh."
40,12,35,"A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things."
40,12,36,"But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment."
40,12,37,"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned."
40,12,38,"Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee."
40,12,39,"But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:"
40,12,40,"For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
40,12,41,"The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas  is  here."
40,12,42,"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon  is  here."
40,12,43,"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none."
40,12,44,"Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth  it  empty, swept, and garnished."
40,12,45,"Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last  state  of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation."
40,12,46,"While he yet talked to the people, behold,  his  mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him."
40,12,47,"Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee."
40,12,48,"But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?"
40,12,49,"And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!"
40,12,50,"For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."
40,13,1,"The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side."
40,13,2,"And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore."
40,13,3,"And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;"
40,13,4,"And when he sowed, some  seeds  fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:"
40,13,5,"Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:"
40,13,6,"And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away."
40,13,7,"And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:"
40,13,8,"But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold."
40,13,9,"Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."
40,13,10,"And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?"
40,13,11,"He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given."
40,13,12,"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath."
40,13,13,"Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand."
40,13,14,"And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:"
40,13,15,"For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and  their  ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with  their  eyes, and hear with  their  ears, and should understand with  their  heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."
40,13,16,"But blessed  are  your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear."
40,13,17,"For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous  men  have desired to see  those things  which ye see, and have not seen  them ; and to hear  those things  which ye hear, and have not heard  them ."
40,13,18,"Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower."
40,13,19,"When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth  it  not, then cometh the wicked  one , and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side."
40,13,20,"But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;"
40,13,21,"Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended."
40,13,22,"He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful."
40,13,23,"But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth  it ; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty."
40,13,24,"Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:"
40,13,25,"But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way."
40,13,26,"But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also."
40,13,27,"So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?"
40,13,28,"He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?"
40,13,29,"But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them."
40,13,30,"Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn."
40,13,31,"Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:"
40,13,32,"Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof."
40,13,33,"Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
40,13,34,"All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:"
40,13,35,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world."
40,13,36,"Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field."
40,13,37,"He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;"
40,13,38,"The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked  one ;"
40,13,39,"The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels."
40,13,40,"As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world."
40,13,41,"The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;"
40,13,42,"And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."
40,13,43,"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."
40,13,44,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field."
40,13,45,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:"
40,13,46,"Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it."
40,13,47,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:"
40,13,48,"Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away."
40,13,49,"So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,"
40,13,50,"And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."
40,13,51,"Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord."
40,13,52,"Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe  which is  instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man  that is  an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure  things  new and old."
40,13,53,"And it came to pass,  that  when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence."
40,13,54,"And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this  man  this wisdom, and  these  mighty works?"
40,13,55,"Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?"
40,13,56,"And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this  man  all these things?"
40,13,57,"And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house."
40,13,58,"And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief."
40,14,1,"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,"
40,14,2,"And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him."
40,14,3,"For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put  him  in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife."
40,14,4,"For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her."
40,14,5,"And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet."
40,14,6,"But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod."
40,14,7,"Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask."
40,14,8,"And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist’s head in a charger."
40,14,9,"And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded  it  to be given  her ."
40,14,10,"And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison."
40,14,11,"And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought  it  to her mother."
40,14,12,"And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus."
40,14,13,"When Jesus heard  of it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard  thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities."
40,14,14,"And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick."
40,14,15,"And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals."
40,14,16,"But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat."
40,14,17,"And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes."
40,14,18,"He said, Bring them hither to me."
40,14,19,"And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to  his  disciples, and the disciples to the multitude."
40,14,20,"And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full."
40,14,21,"And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children."
40,14,22,"And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away."
40,14,23,"And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone."
40,14,24,"But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary."
40,14,25,"And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea."
40,14,26,"And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear."
40,14,27,"But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid."
40,14,28,"And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water."
40,14,29,"And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus."
40,14,30,"But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me."
40,14,31,"And immediately Jesus stretched forth  his  hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"
40,14,32,"And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased."
40,14,33,"Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God."
40,14,34,"And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret."
40,14,35,"And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;"
40,14,36,"And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole."
40,15,1,"Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,"
40,15,2,"Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread."
40,15,3,"But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?"
40,15,4,"For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death."
40,15,5,"But ye say, Whosoever shall say to  his  father or  his  mother,  It is  a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;"
40,15,6,"And honour not his father or his mother,  he shall be free . Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition."
40,15,7,"Ye  hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,"
40,15,8,"This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with  their  lips; but their heart is far from me."
40,15,9,"But in vain they do worship me, teaching  for  doctrines the commandments of men."
40,15,10,"And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:"
40,15,11,"Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man."
40,15,12,"Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?"
40,15,13,"But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up."
40,15,14,"Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch."
40,15,15,"Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable."
40,15,16,"And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?"
40,15,17,"Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?"
40,15,18,"But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man."
40,15,19,"For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:"
40,15,20,"These are  the things  which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man."
40,15,21,"Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon."
40,15,22,"And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord,  thou  Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil."
40,15,23,"But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us."
40,15,24,"But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
40,15,25,"Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me."
40,15,26,"But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast  it  to dogs."
40,15,27,"And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table."
40,15,28,"Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great  is  thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour."
40,15,29,"And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there."
40,15,30,"And great multitudes came unto him, having with them  those that were  lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:"
40,15,31,"Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel."
40,15,32,"Then Jesus called his disciples  unto him , and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way."
40,15,33,"And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?"
40,15,34,"And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes."
40,15,35,"And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground."
40,15,36,"And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake  them , and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude."
40,15,37,"And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken  meat  that was left seven baskets full."
40,15,38,"And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children."
40,15,39,"And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala."
40,16,1,"The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven."
40,16,2,"He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say,  It will be  fair weather: for the sky is red."
40,16,3,"And in the morning,  It will be  foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O  ye  hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not  discern  the signs of the times?"
40,16,4,"A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed."
40,16,5,"And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread."
40,16,6,"Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees."
40,16,7,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying,  It is  because we have taken no bread."
40,16,8,"Which  when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?"
40,16,9,"Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?"
40,16,10,"Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?"
40,16,11,"How is it that ye do not understand that I spake  it  not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?"
40,16,12,"Then understood they how that he bade  them  not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees."
40,16,13,"When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?"
40,16,14,"And they said, Some  say that thou art  John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets."
40,16,15,"He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?"
40,16,16,"And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
40,16,17,"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed  it  unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
40,16,18,"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
40,16,19,"And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
40,16,20,"Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ."
40,16,21,"From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day."
40,16,22,"Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee."
40,16,23,"But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men."
40,16,24,"Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any  man  will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."
40,16,25,"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."
40,16,26,"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"
40,16,27,"For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works."
40,16,28,"Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom."
40,17,1,"And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,"
40,17,2,"And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light."
40,17,3,"And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him."
40,17,4,"Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias."
40,17,5,"While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him."
40,17,6,"And when the disciples heard  it , they fell on their face, and were sore afraid."
40,17,7,"And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid."
40,17,8,"And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only."
40,17,9,"And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead."
40,17,10,"And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?"
40,17,11,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things."
40,17,12,"But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them."
40,17,13,"Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist."
40,17,14,"And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a  certain  man, kneeling down to him, and saying,"
40,17,15,"Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water."
40,17,16,"And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him."
40,17,17,"Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me."
40,17,18,"And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour."
40,17,19,"Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?"
40,17,20,"And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you."
40,17,21,"Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting."
40,17,22,"And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:"
40,17,23,"And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry."
40,17,24,"And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute  money  came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?"
40,17,25,"He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?"
40,17,26,"Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free."
40,17,27,"Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee."
40,18,1,"At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
40,18,2,"And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,"
40,18,3,"And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."
40,18,4,"Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
40,18,5,"And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me."
40,18,6,"But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and  that  he were drowned in the depth of the sea."
40,18,7,"Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!"
40,18,8,"Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast  them  from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire."
40,18,9,"And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast  it  from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire."
40,18,10,"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven."
40,18,11,"For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost."
40,18,12,"How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?"
40,18,13,"And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that  sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astray."
40,18,14,"Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish."
40,18,15,"Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother."
40,18,16,"But if he will not hear  thee, then  take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established."
40,18,17,"And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell  it  unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican."
40,18,18,"Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
40,18,19,"Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven."
40,18,20,"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them."
40,18,21,"Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?"
40,18,22,"Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."
40,18,23,"Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants."
40,18,24,"And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents."
40,18,25,"But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made."
40,18,26,"The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all."
40,18,27,"Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt."
40,18,28,"But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took  him  by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest."
40,18,29,"And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all."
40,18,30,"And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt."
40,18,31,"So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done."
40,18,32,"Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:"
40,18,33,"Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?"
40,18,34,"And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him."
40,18,35,"So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses."
40,19,1,"And it came to pass,  that  when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;"
40,19,2,"And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there."
40,19,3,"The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?"
40,19,4,"And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made  them  at the beginning made them male and female,"
40,19,5,"And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?"
40,19,6,"Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."
40,19,7,"They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?"
40,19,8,"He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so."
40,19,9,"And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except  it be  for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery."
40,19,10,"His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with  his  wife, it is not good to marry."
40,19,11,"But he said unto them, All  men  cannot receive this saying, save  they  to whom it is given."
40,19,12,"For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from  their  mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive  it , let him receive  it ."
40,19,13,"Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put  his  hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them."
40,19,14,"But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
40,19,15,"And he laid  his  hands on them, and departed thence."
40,19,16,"And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"
40,19,17,"And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good?  there is  none good but one,  that is , God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments."
40,19,18,"He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,"
40,19,19,"Honour thy father and  thy  mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
40,19,20,"The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?"
40,19,21,"Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go  and  sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come  and  follow me."
40,19,22,"But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions."
40,19,23,"Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven."
40,19,24,"And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
40,19,25,"When his disciples heard  it , they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?"
40,19,26,"But Jesus beheld  them , and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible."
40,19,27,"Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?"
40,19,28,"And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
40,19,29,"And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life."
40,19,30,"But many  that are  first shall be last; and the last  shall be  first."
40,20,1,"For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man  that is  an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard."
40,20,2,"And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard."
40,20,3,"And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,"
40,20,4,"And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way."
40,20,5,"Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise."
40,20,6,"And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?"
40,20,7,"They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right,  that  shall ye receive."
40,20,8,"So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them  their  hire, beginning from the last unto the first."
40,20,9,"And when they came that  were hired  about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny."
40,20,10,"But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny."
40,20,11,"And when they had received  it , they murmured against the goodman of the house,"
40,20,12,"Saying, These last have wrought  but  one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day."
40,20,13,"But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?"
40,20,14,"Take  that  thine  is , and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee."
40,20,15,"Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?"
40,20,16,"So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen."
40,20,17,"And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,"
40,20,18,"Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,"
40,20,19,"And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify  him : and the third day he shall rise again."
40,20,20,"Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons, worshipping  him , and desiring a certain thing of him."
40,20,21,"And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom."
40,20,22,"But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able."
40,20,23,"And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but  it shall be given to them  for whom it is prepared of my Father."
40,20,24,"And when the ten heard  it , they were moved with indignation against the two brethren."
40,20,25,"But Jesus called them  unto him , and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them."
40,20,26,"But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;"
40,20,27,"And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:"
40,20,28,"Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
40,20,29,"And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him."
40,20,30,"And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord,  thou  Son of David."
40,20,31,"And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord,  thou  Son of David."
40,20,32,"And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?"
40,20,33,"They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened."
40,20,34,"So Jesus had compassion  on them , and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him."
40,21,1,"And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,"
40,21,2,"Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose  them , and bring  them  unto me."
40,21,3,"And if any  man  say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them."
40,21,4,"All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,"
40,21,5,"Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass."
40,21,6,"And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,"
40,21,7,"And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set  him  thereon."
40,21,8,"And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed  them  in the way."
40,21,9,"And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed  is  he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest."
40,21,10,"And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?"
40,21,11,"And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee."
40,21,12,"And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,"
40,21,13,"And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves."
40,21,14,"And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them."
40,21,15,"And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,"
40,21,16,"And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"
40,21,17,"And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there."
40,21,18,"Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered."
40,21,19,"And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away."
40,21,20,"And when the disciples saw  it , they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!"
40,21,21,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this  which is done  to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done."
40,21,22,"And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive."
40,21,23,"And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?"
40,21,24,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things."
40,21,25,"The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?"
40,21,26,"But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet."
40,21,27,"And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things."
40,21,28,"But what think ye? A  certain  man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard."
40,21,29,"He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went."
40,21,30,"And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I  go , sir: and went not."
40,21,31,"Whether of them twain did the will of  his  father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you."
40,21,32,"For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen  it , repented not afterward, that ye might believe him."
40,21,33,"Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:"
40,21,34,"And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it."
40,21,35,"And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another."
40,21,36,"Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise."
40,21,37,"But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son."
40,21,38,"But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance."
40,21,39,"And they caught him, and cast  him  out of the vineyard, and slew  him ."
40,21,40,"When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?"
40,21,41,"They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out  his  vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons."
40,21,42,"Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?"
40,21,43,"Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof."
40,21,44,"And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
40,21,45,"And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them."
40,21,46,"But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet."
40,22,1,"And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,"
40,22,2,"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,"
40,22,3,"And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come."
40,22,4,"Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and  my  fatlings  are  killed, and all things  are  ready: come unto the marriage."
40,22,5,"But they made light of  it , and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:"
40,22,6,"And the remnant took his servants, and entreated  them  spitefully, and slew  them ."
40,22,7,"But when the king heard  thereof , he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city."
40,22,8,"Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy."
40,22,9,"Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage."
40,22,10,"So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests."
40,22,11,"And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:"
40,22,12,"And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless."
40,22,13,"Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast  him  into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40,22,14,"For many are called, but few  are  chosen."
40,22,15,"Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in  his  talk."
40,22,16,"And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any  man : for thou regardest not the person of men."
40,22,17,"Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?"
40,22,18,"But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me,  ye  hypocrites?"
40,22,19,"Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny."
40,22,20,"And he saith unto them, Whose  is  this image and superscription?"
40,22,21,"They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s."
40,22,22,"When they had heard  these words , they marvelled, and left him, and went their way."
40,22,23,"The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,"
40,22,24,"Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."
40,22,25,"Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:"
40,22,26,"Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh."
40,22,27,"And last of all the woman died also."
40,22,28,"Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her."
40,22,29,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God."
40,22,30,"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven."
40,22,31,"But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,"
40,22,32,"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
40,22,33,"And when the multitude heard  this , they were astonished at his doctrine."
40,22,34,"But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together."
40,22,35,"Then one of them,  which was  a lawyer, asked  him a question , tempting him, and saying,"
40,22,36,"Master, which  is  the great commandment in the law?"
40,22,37,"Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind."
40,22,38,"This is the first and great commandment."
40,22,39,"And the second  is  like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
40,22,40,"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."
40,22,41,"While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,"
40,22,42,"Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him,  The Son  of David."
40,22,43,"He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,"
40,22,44,"The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?"
40,22,45,"If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?"
40,22,46,"And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any  man  from that day forth ask him any more  questions ."
40,23,1,"Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,"
40,23,2,"Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat:"
40,23,3,"All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe,  that  observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not."
40,23,4,"For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay  them  on men’s shoulders; but they  themselves  will not move them with one of their fingers."
40,23,5,"But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,"
40,23,6,"And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,"
40,23,7,"And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi."
40,23,8,"But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master,  even  Christ; and all ye are brethren."
40,23,9,"And call no  man  your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven."
40,23,10,"Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master,  even  Christ."
40,23,11,"But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant."
40,23,12,"And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted."
40,23,13,"But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in  yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in."
40,23,14,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation."
40,23,15,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves."
40,23,16,"Woe unto you,  ye  blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!"
40,23,17,"Ye  fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?"
40,23,18,"And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty."
40,23,19,"Ye  fools and blind: for whether  is  greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?"
40,23,20,"Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon."
40,23,21,"And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein."
40,23,22,"And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon."
40,23,23,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier  matters  of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."
40,23,24,"Ye  blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel."
40,23,25,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess."
40,23,26,"Thou  blind Pharisee, cleanse first that  which is  within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also."
40,23,27,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead  men’s  bones, and of all uncleanness."
40,23,28,"Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity."
40,23,29,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,"
40,23,30,"And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets."
40,23,31,"Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets."
40,23,32,"Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers."
40,23,33,"Ye  serpents,  ye  generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?"
40,23,34,"Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and  some  of them ye shall kill and crucify; and  some  of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute  them  from city to city:"
40,23,35,"That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar."
40,23,36,"Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation."
40,23,37,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,  thou  that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under  her  wings, and ye would not!"
40,23,38,"Behold, your house is left unto you desolate."
40,23,39,"For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed  is  he that cometh in the name of the Lord."
40,24,1,"And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to  him  for to shew him the buildings of the temple."
40,24,2,"And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
40,24,3,"And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what  shall be  the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?"
40,24,4,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you."
40,24,5,"For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many."
40,24,6,"And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all  these things  must come to pass, but the end is not yet."
40,24,7,"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places."
40,24,8,"All these  are  the beginning of sorrows."
40,24,9,"Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake."
40,24,10,"And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another."
40,24,11,"And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many."
40,24,12,"And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold."
40,24,13,"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."
40,24,14,"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
40,24,15,"When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)"
40,24,16,"Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:"
40,24,17,"Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:"
40,24,18,"Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes."
40,24,19,"And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!"
40,24,20,"But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:"
40,24,21,"For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be."
40,24,22,"And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened."
40,24,23,"Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here  is  Christ, or there; believe  it  not."
40,24,24,"For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if  it were  possible, they shall deceive the very elect."
40,24,25,"Behold, I have told you before."
40,24,26,"Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold,  he is  in the secret chambers; believe  it  not."
40,24,27,"For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."
40,24,28,"For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together."
40,24,29,"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:"
40,24,30,"And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."
40,24,31,"And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other."
40,24,32,"Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer  is  nigh:"
40,24,33,"So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near,  even  at the doors."
40,24,34,"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled."
40,24,35,"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away."
40,24,36,"But of that day and hour knoweth no  man , no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only."
40,24,37,"But as the days of Noe  were , so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."
40,24,38,"For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,"
40,24,39,"And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."
40,24,40,"Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
40,24,41,"Two  women shall be  grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
40,24,42,"Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come."
40,24,43,"But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up."
40,24,44,"Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh."
40,24,45,"Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?"
40,24,46,"Blessed  is  that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing."
40,24,47,"Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods."
40,24,48,"But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;"
40,24,49,"And shall begin to smite  his  fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;"
40,24,50,"The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for  him , and in an hour that he is not aware of,"
40,24,51,"And shall cut him asunder, and appoint  him  his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40,25,1,"Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom."
40,25,2,"And five of them were wise, and five  were  foolish."
40,25,3,"They that  were  foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:"
40,25,4,"But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps."
40,25,5,"While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept."
40,25,6,"And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him."
40,25,7,"Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps."
40,25,8,"And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out."
40,25,9,"But the wise answered, saying,  Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves."
40,25,10,"And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut."
40,25,11,"Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us."
40,25,12,"But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not."
40,25,13,"Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh."
40,25,14,"For  the kingdom of heaven is  as a man travelling into a far country,  who  called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods."
40,25,15,"And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey."
40,25,16,"Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made  them  other five talents."
40,25,17,"And likewise he that  had received  two, he also gained other two."
40,25,18,"But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money."
40,25,19,"After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them."
40,25,20,"And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more."
40,25,21,"His lord said unto him, Well done,  thou  good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."
40,25,22,"He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them."
40,25,23,"His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."
40,25,24,"Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:"
40,25,25,"And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo,  there  thou hast  that is  thine."
40,25,26,"His lord answered and said unto him,  Thou  wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:"
40,25,27,"Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and  then  at my coming I should have received mine own with usury."
40,25,28,"Take therefore the talent from him, and give  it  unto him which hath ten talents."
40,25,29,"For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath."
40,25,30,"And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40,25,31,"When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:"
40,25,32,"And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth  his  sheep from the goats:"
40,25,33,"And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left."
40,25,34,"Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:"
40,25,35,"For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:"
40,25,36,"Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me."
40,25,37,"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed  thee ? or thirsty, and gave  thee  drink?"
40,25,38,"When saw we thee a stranger, and took  thee  in? or naked, and clothed  thee ?"
40,25,39,"Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?"
40,25,40,"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done  it  unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done  it  unto me."
40,25,41,"Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:"
40,25,42,"For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:"
40,25,43,"I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not."
40,25,44,"Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?"
40,25,45,"Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did  it  not to one of the least of these, ye did  it  not to me."
40,25,46,"And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal."
40,26,1,"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,"
40,26,2,"Ye know that after two days is  the feast of  the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified."
40,26,3,"Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,"
40,26,4,"And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill  him ."
40,26,5,"But they said, Not on the feast  day , lest there be an uproar among the people."
40,26,6,"Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,"
40,26,7,"There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat  at meat ."
40,26,8,"But when his disciples saw  it , they had indignation, saying, To what purpose  is  this waste?"
40,26,9,"For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor."
40,26,10,"When Jesus understood  it , he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me."
40,26,11,"For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always."
40,26,12,"For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did  it  for my burial."
40,26,13,"Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world,  there  shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her."
40,26,14,"Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,"
40,26,15,"And said  unto them , What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver."
40,26,16,"And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him."
40,26,17,"Now the first  day  of the  feast of  unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?"
40,26,18,"And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples."
40,26,19,"And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover."
40,26,20,"Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve."
40,26,21,"And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me."
40,26,22,"And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?"
40,26,23,"And he answered and said, He that dippeth  his  hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me."
40,26,24,"The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born."
40,26,25,"Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said."
40,26,26,"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed  it , and brake  it , and gave  it  to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body."
40,26,27,"And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave  it  to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;"
40,26,28,"For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins."
40,26,29,"But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom."
40,26,30,"And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives."
40,26,31,"Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad."
40,26,32,"But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee."
40,26,33,"Peter answered and said unto him, Though all  men  shall be offended because of thee,  yet  will I never be offended."
40,26,34,"Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice."
40,26,35,"Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples."
40,26,36,"Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder."
40,26,37,"And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy."
40,26,38,"Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me."
40,26,39,"And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou  wilt ."
40,26,40,"And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?"
40,26,41,"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed  is  willing, but the flesh  is  weak."
40,26,42,"He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done."
40,26,43,"And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy."
40,26,44,"And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words."
40,26,45,"Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take  your  rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
40,26,46,"Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me."
40,26,47,"And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people."
40,26,48,"Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast."
40,26,49,"And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him."
40,26,50,"And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him."
40,26,51,"And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out  his  hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear."
40,26,52,"Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."
40,26,53,"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?"
40,26,54,"But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?"
40,26,55,"In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me."
40,26,56,"But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled."
40,26,57,"And they that had laid hold on Jesus led  him  away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled."
40,26,58,"But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end."
40,26,59,"Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;"
40,26,60,"But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came,  yet  found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,"
40,26,61,"And said, This  fellow  said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days."
40,26,62,"And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what  is it which  these witness against thee?"
40,26,63,"But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God."
40,26,64,"Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."
40,26,65,"Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy."
40,26,66,"What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death."
40,26,67,"Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote  him  with the palms of their hands,"
40,26,68,"Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?"
40,26,69,"Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee."
40,26,70,"But he denied before  them  all, saying, I know not what thou sayest."
40,26,71,"And when he was gone out into the porch, another  maid  saw him, and said unto them that were there, This  fellow  was also with Jesus of Nazareth."
40,26,72,"And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man."
40,26,73,"And after a while came unto  him  they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art  one  of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee."
40,26,74,"Then began he to curse and to swear,  saying , I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew."
40,26,75,"And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly."
40,27,1,"When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:"
40,27,2,"And when they had bound him, they led  him  away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor."
40,27,3,"Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,"
40,27,4,"Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What  is that  to us? see thou  to that ."
40,27,5,"And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself."
40,27,6,"And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."
40,27,7,"And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in."
40,27,8,"Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day."
40,27,9,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;"
40,27,10,"And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me."
40,27,11,"And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest."
40,27,12,"And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing."
40,27,13,"Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?"
40,27,14,"And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly."
40,27,15,"Now at  that  feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would."
40,27,16,"And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas."
40,27,17,"Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?"
40,27,18,"For he knew that for envy they had delivered him."
40,27,19,"When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
40,27,20,"But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus."
40,27,21,"The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas."
40,27,22,"Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?  They  all say unto him, Let him be crucified."
40,27,23,"And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified."
40,27,24,"When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but  that  rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed  his  hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye  to it ."
40,27,25,"Then answered all the people, and said, His blood  be  on us, and on our children."
40,27,26,"Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered  him  to be crucified."
40,27,27,"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band  of soldiers ."
40,27,28,"And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe."
40,27,29,"And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put  it  upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!"
40,27,30,"And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head."
40,27,31,"And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify  him ."
40,27,32,"And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross."
40,27,33,"And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,"
40,27,34,"They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted  thereof , he would not drink."
40,27,35,"And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots."
40,27,36,"And sitting down they watched him there;"
40,27,37,"And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
40,27,38,"Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left."
40,27,39,"And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,"
40,27,40,"And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest  it  in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross."
40,27,41,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking  him , with the scribes and elders, said,"
40,27,42,"He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him."
40,27,43,"He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God."
40,27,44,"The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth."
40,27,45,"Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour."
40,27,46,"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
40,27,47,"Some of them that stood there, when they heard  that , said, This  man  calleth for Elias."
40,27,48,"And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled  it  with vinegar, and put  it  on a reed, and gave him to drink."
40,27,49,"The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him."
40,27,50,"Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost."
40,27,51,"And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;"
40,27,52,"And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,"
40,27,53,"And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many."
40,27,54,"Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God."
40,27,55,"And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:"
40,27,56,"Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children."
40,27,57,"When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:"
40,27,58,"He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered."
40,27,59,"And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"
40,27,60,"And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed."
40,27,61,"And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre."
40,27,62,"Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,"
40,27,63,"Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again."
40,27,64,"Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first."
40,27,65,"Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make  it  as sure as ye can."
40,27,66,"So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch."
40,28,1,"In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first  day  of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre."
40,28,2,"And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it."
40,28,3,"His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:"
40,28,4,"And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead  men ."
40,28,5,"And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified."
40,28,6,"He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay."
40,28,7,"And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you."
40,28,8,"And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word."
40,28,9,"And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him."
40,28,10,"Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me."
40,28,11,"Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done."
40,28,12,"And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,"
40,28,13,"Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him  away  while we slept."
40,28,14,"And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you."
40,28,15,"So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day."
40,28,16,"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them."
40,28,17,"And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted."
40,28,18,"And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth."
40,28,19,"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:"
40,28,20,"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway,  even  unto the end of the world. Amen."
41,1,1,"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;"
41,1,2,"As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee."
41,1,3,"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
41,1,4,"John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins."
41,1,5,"And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins."
41,1,6,"And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;"
41,1,7,"And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose."
41,1,8,"I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost."
41,1,9,"And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan."
41,1,10,"And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:"
41,1,11,"And there came a voice from heaven,  saying , Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
41,1,12,"And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness."
41,1,13,"And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him."
41,1,14,"Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,"
41,1,15,"And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel."
41,1,16,"Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers."
41,1,17,"And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men."
41,1,18,"And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him."
41,1,19,"And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the  son  of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets."
41,1,20,"And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him."
41,1,21,"And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught."
41,1,22,"And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes."
41,1,23,"And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,"
41,1,24,"Saying, Let  us  alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God."
41,1,25,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him."
41,1,26,"And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him."
41,1,27,"And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine  is  this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him."
41,1,28,"And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee."
41,1,29,"And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
41,1,30,"But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her."
41,1,31,"And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them."
41,1,32,"And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils."
41,1,33,"And all the city was gathered together at the door."
41,1,34,"And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him."
41,1,35,"And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed."
41,1,36,"And Simon and they that were with him followed after him."
41,1,37,"And when they had found him, they said unto him, All  men  seek for thee."
41,1,38,"And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth."
41,1,39,"And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils."
41,1,40,"And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."
41,1,41,"And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth  his  hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean."
41,1,42,"And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed."
41,1,43,"And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;"
41,1,44,"And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them."
41,1,45,"But he went out, and began to publish  it  much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter."
41,2,1,"And again he entered into Capernaum, after  some  days; and it was noised that he was in the house."
41,2,2,"And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive  them , no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them."
41,2,3,"And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four."
41,2,4,"And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken  it  up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay."
41,2,5,"When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee."
41,2,6,"But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,"
41,2,7,"Why doth this  man  thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?"
41,2,8,"And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?"
41,2,9,"Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy,  Thy  sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?"
41,2,10,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)"
41,2,11,"I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house."
41,2,12,"And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion."
41,2,13,"And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them."
41,2,14,"And as he passed by, he saw Levi the  son  of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him."
41,2,15,"And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him."
41,2,16,"And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?"
41,2,17,"When Jesus heard  it , he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
41,2,18,"And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?"
41,2,19,"And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
41,2,20,"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days."
41,2,21,"No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse."
41,2,22,"And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles."
41,2,23,"And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn."
41,2,24,"And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?"
41,2,25,"And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?"
41,2,26,"How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?"
41,2,27,"And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:"
41,2,28,"Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."
41,3,1,"And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand."
41,3,2,"And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him."
41,3,3,"And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth."
41,3,4,"And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace."
41,3,5,"And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched  it  out: and his hand was restored whole as the other."
41,3,6,"And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him."
41,3,7,"But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,"
41,3,8,"And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and  from  beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him."
41,3,9,"And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him."
41,3,10,"For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues."
41,3,11,"And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God."
41,3,12,"And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known."
41,3,13,"And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth  unto him  whom he would: and they came unto him."
41,3,14,"And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,"
41,3,15,"And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:"
41,3,16,"And Simon he surnamed Peter;"
41,3,17,"And James the  son  of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:"
41,3,18,"And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the  son  of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,"
41,3,19,"And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house."
41,3,20,"And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread."
41,3,21,"And when his friends heard  of it , they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself."
41,3,22,"And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils."
41,3,23,"And he called them  unto him , and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?"
41,3,24,"And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
41,3,25,"And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand."
41,3,26,"And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end."
41,3,27,"No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house."
41,3,28,"Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:"
41,3,29,"But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:"
41,3,30,"Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit."
41,3,31,"There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him."
41,3,32,"And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee."
41,3,33,"And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?"
41,3,34,"And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!"
41,3,35,"For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."
41,4,1,"And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land."
41,4,2,"And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,"
41,4,3,"Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:"
41,4,4,"And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up."
41,4,5,"And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:"
41,4,6,"But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away."
41,4,7,"And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit."
41,4,8,"And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred."
41,4,9,"And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
41,4,10,"And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable."
41,4,11,"And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all  these  things are done in parables:"
41,4,12,"That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and  their  sins should be forgiven them."
41,4,13,"And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?"
41,4,14,"The sower soweth the word."
41,4,15,"And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts."
41,4,16,"And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;"
41,4,17,"And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended."
41,4,18,"And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,"
41,4,19,"And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful."
41,4,20,"And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive  it , and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred."
41,4,21,"And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?"
41,4,22,"For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad."
41,4,23,"If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."
41,4,24,"And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given."
41,4,25,"For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath."
41,4,26,"And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;"
41,4,27,"And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how."
41,4,28,"For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear."
41,4,29,"But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come."
41,4,30,"And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?"
41,4,31,"It is  like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:"
41,4,32,"But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it."
41,4,33,"And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear  it ."
41,4,34,"But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples."
41,4,35,"And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side."
41,4,36,"And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships."
41,4,37,"And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full."
41,4,38,"And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?"
41,4,39,"And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm."
41,4,40,"And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?"
41,4,41,"And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
41,5,1,"And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes."
41,5,2,"And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,"
41,5,3,"Who had  his  dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:"
41,5,4,"Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any  man  tame him."
41,5,5,"And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones."
41,5,6,"But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,"
41,5,7,"And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,  thou  Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not."
41,5,8,"For he said unto him, Come out of the man,  thou  unclean spirit."
41,5,9,"And he asked him, What  is  thy name? And he answered, saying, My name  is  Legion: for we are many."
41,5,10,"And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country."
41,5,11,"Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding."
41,5,12,"And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them."
41,5,13,"And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea."
41,5,14,"And they that fed the swine fled, and told  it  in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done."
41,5,15,"And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."
41,5,16,"And they that saw  it  told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and  also  concerning the swine."
41,5,17,"And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts."
41,5,18,"And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him."
41,5,19,"Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee."
41,5,20,"And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all  men  did marvel."
41,5,21,"And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea."
41,5,22,"And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,"
41,5,23,"And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death:  I pray thee , come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live."
41,5,24,"And  Jesus  went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him."
41,5,25,"And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,"
41,5,26,"And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,"
41,5,27,"When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment."
41,5,28,"For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole."
41,5,29,"And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in  her  body that she was healed of that plague."
41,5,30,"And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?"
41,5,31,"And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?"
41,5,32,"And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing."
41,5,33,"But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth."
41,5,34,"And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague."
41,5,35,"While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s  house certain  which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?"
41,5,36,"As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe."
41,5,37,"And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James."
41,5,38,"And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly."
41,5,39,"And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth."
41,5,40,"And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying."
41,5,41,"And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise."
41,5,42,"And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was  of the age  of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment."
41,5,43,"And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat."
41,6,1,"And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him."
41,6,2,"And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing  him  were astonished, saying, From whence hath this  man  these things? and what wisdom  is  this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?"
41,6,3,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him."
41,6,4,"But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house."
41,6,5,"And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed  them ."
41,6,6,"And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching."
41,6,7,"And he called  unto him  the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;"
41,6,8,"And commanded them that they should take nothing for  their  journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in  their  purse:"
41,6,9,"But  be  shod with sandals; and not put on two coats."
41,6,10,"And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place."
41,6,11,"And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city."
41,6,12,"And they went out, and preached that men should repent."
41,6,13,"And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed  them ."
41,6,14,"And king Herod heard  of him ; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him."
41,6,15,"Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets."
41,6,16,"But when Herod heard  thereof , he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead."
41,6,17,"For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her."
41,6,18,"For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife."
41,6,19,"Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:"
41,6,20,"For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly."
41,6,21,"And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief  estates  of Galilee;"
41,6,22,"And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give  it  thee."
41,6,23,"And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give  it  thee, unto the half of my kingdom."
41,6,24,"And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist."
41,6,25,"And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist."
41,6,26,"And the king was exceeding sorry;  yet  for his oath’s sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her."
41,6,27,"And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,"
41,6,28,"And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother."
41,6,29,"And when his disciples heard  of it , they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb."
41,6,30,"And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught."
41,6,31,"And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat."
41,6,32,"And they departed into a desert place by ship privately."
41,6,33,"And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him."
41,6,34,"And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things."
41,6,35,"And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time  is  far passed:"
41,6,36,"Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat."
41,6,37,"He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?"
41,6,38,"He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes."
41,6,39,"And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass."
41,6,40,"And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties."
41,6,41,"And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave  them  to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all."
41,6,42,"And they did all eat, and were filled."
41,6,43,"And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes."
41,6,44,"And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men."
41,6,45,"And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people."
41,6,46,"And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray."
41,6,47,"And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land."
41,6,48,"And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them."
41,6,49,"But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:"
41,6,50,"For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid."
41,6,51,"And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered."
41,6,52,"For they considered not  the miracle  of the loaves: for their heart was hardened."
41,6,53,"And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore."
41,6,54,"And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,"
41,6,55,"And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was."
41,6,56,"And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole."
41,7,1,"Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem."
41,7,2,"And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault."
41,7,3,"For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash  their  hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders."
41,7,4,"And  when they come  from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold,  as  the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables."
41,7,5,"Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?"
41,7,6,"He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with  their  lips, but their heart is far from me."
41,7,7,"Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching  for  doctrines the commandments of men."
41,7,8,"For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men,  as  the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do."
41,7,9,"And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition."
41,7,10,"For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:"
41,7,11,"But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother,  It is  Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;  he shall be free ."
41,7,12,"And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;"
41,7,13,"Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye."
41,7,14,"And when he had called all the people  unto him , he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one  of you , and understand:"
41,7,15,"There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man."
41,7,16,"If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."
41,7,17,"And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable."
41,7,18,"And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man,  it  cannot defile him;"
41,7,19,"Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?"
41,7,20,"And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man."
41,7,21,"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,"
41,7,22,"Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:"
41,7,23,"All these evil things come from within, and defile the man."
41,7,24,"And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know  it : but he could not be hid."
41,7,25,"For a  certain  woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:"
41,7,26,"The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter."
41,7,27,"But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast  it  unto the dogs."
41,7,28,"And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs."
41,7,29,"And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter."
41,7,30,"And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed."
41,7,31,"And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis."
41,7,32,"And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him."
41,7,33,"And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;"
41,7,34,"And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened."
41,7,35,"And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain."
41,7,36,"And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published  it ;"
41,7,37,"And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak."
41,8,1,"In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples  unto him , and saith unto them,"
41,8,2,"I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:"
41,8,3,"And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far."
41,8,4,"And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these  men  with bread here in the wilderness?"
41,8,5,"And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven."
41,8,6,"And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before  them ; and they did set  them  before the people."
41,8,7,"And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before  them ."
41,8,8,"So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken  meat  that was left seven baskets."
41,8,9,"And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away."
41,8,10,"And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha."
41,8,11,"And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him."
41,8,12,"And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation."
41,8,13,"And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side."
41,8,14,"Now  the disciples  had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf."
41,8,15,"And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and  of  the leaven of Herod."
41,8,16,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying,  It is  because we have no bread."
41,8,17,"And when Jesus knew  it , he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?"
41,8,18,"Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?"
41,8,19,"When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve."
41,8,20,"And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven."
41,8,21,"And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?"
41,8,22,"And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him."
41,8,23,"And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought."
41,8,24,"And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking."
41,8,25,"After that he put  his  hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly."
41,8,26,"And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell  it  to any in the town."
41,8,27,"And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?"
41,8,28,"And they answered, John the Baptist: but some  say , Elias; and others, One of the prophets."
41,8,29,"And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ."
41,8,30,"And he charged them that they should tell no man of him."
41,8,31,"And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and  of  the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
41,8,32,"And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him."
41,8,33,"But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men."
41,8,34,"And when he had called the people  unto him  with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."
41,8,35,"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it."
41,8,36,"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
41,8,37,"Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"
41,8,38,"Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
41,9,1,"And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power."
41,9,2,"And after six days Jesus taketh  with him  Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them."
41,9,3,"And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them."
41,9,4,"And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus."
41,9,5,"And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias."
41,9,6,"For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid."
41,9,7,"And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."
41,9,8,"And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves."
41,9,9,"And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead."
41,9,10,"And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean."
41,9,11,"And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?"
41,9,12,"And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought."
41,9,13,"But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him."
41,9,14,"And when he came to  his  disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them."
41,9,15,"And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to  him  saluted him."
41,9,16,"And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?"
41,9,17,"And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;"
41,9,18,"And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not."
41,9,19,"He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me."
41,9,20,"And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming."
41,9,21,"And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child."
41,9,22,"And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us."
41,9,23,"Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things  are  possible to him that believeth."
41,9,24,"And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief."
41,9,25,"When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him,  Thou  dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him."
41,9,26,"And  the spirit  cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead."
41,9,27,"But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose."
41,9,28,"And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?"
41,9,29,"And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting."
41,9,30,"And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know  it ."
41,9,31,"For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day."
41,9,32,"But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him."
41,9,33,"And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?"
41,9,34,"But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who  should be  the greatest."
41,9,35,"And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first,  the same  shall be last of all, and servant of all."
41,9,36,"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,"
41,9,37,"Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me."
41,9,38,"And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us."
41,9,39,"But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me."
41,9,40,"For he that is not against us is on our part."
41,9,41,"For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward."
41,9,42,"And whosoever shall offend one of  these  little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea."
41,9,43,"And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:"
41,9,44,"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
41,9,45,"And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:"
41,9,46,"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
41,9,47,"And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:"
41,9,48,"Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
41,9,49,"For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt."
41,9,50,"Salt  is  good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another."
41,10,1,"And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again."
41,10,2,"And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away  his  wife? tempting him."
41,10,3,"And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?"
41,10,4,"And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put  her  away."
41,10,5,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept."
41,10,6,"But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female."
41,10,7,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;"
41,10,8,"And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh."
41,10,9,"What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."
41,10,10,"And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same  matter ."
41,10,11,"And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her."
41,10,12,"And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery."
41,10,13,"And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and  his  disciples rebuked those that brought  them ."
41,10,14,"But when Jesus saw  it , he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God."
41,10,15,"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein."
41,10,16,"And he took them up in his arms, put  his  hands upon them, and blessed them."
41,10,17,"And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
41,10,18,"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good?  there is  none good but one,  that is , God."
41,10,19,"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother."
41,10,20,"And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth."
41,10,21,"Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me."
41,10,22,"And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions."
41,10,23,"And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!"
41,10,24,"And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"
41,10,25,"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
41,10,26,"And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?"
41,10,27,"And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men  it is  impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible."
41,10,28,"Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee."
41,10,29,"And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,"
41,10,30,"But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life."
41,10,31,"But many  that are  first shall be last; and the last first."
41,10,32,"And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,"
41,10,33,"Saying , Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:"
41,10,34,"And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again."
41,10,35,"And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire."
41,10,36,"And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?"
41,10,37,"They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory."
41,10,38,"But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
41,10,39,"And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:"
41,10,40,"But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but  it shall be given to them  for whom it is prepared."
41,10,41,"And when the ten heard  it , they began to be much displeased with James and John."
41,10,42,"But Jesus called them  to him , and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them."
41,10,43,"But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:"
41,10,44,"And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all."
41,10,45,"For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
41,10,46,"And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging."
41,10,47,"And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus,  thou  Son of David, have mercy on me."
41,10,48,"And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal,  Thou  Son of David, have mercy on me."
41,10,49,"And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee."
41,10,50,"And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus."
41,10,51,"And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight."
41,10,52,"And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way."
41,11,1,"And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,"
41,11,2,"And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring  him ."
41,11,3,"And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither."
41,11,4,"And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him."
41,11,5,"And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?"
41,11,6,"And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go."
41,11,7,"And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him."
41,11,8,"And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed  them  in the way."
41,11,9,"And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed  is  he that cometh in the name of the Lord:"
41,11,10,"Blessed  be  the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest."
41,11,11,"And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve."
41,11,12,"And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:"
41,11,13,"And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not  yet ."
41,11,14,"And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard  it ."
41,11,15,"And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;"
41,11,16,"And would not suffer that any man should carry  any  vessel through the temple."
41,11,17,"And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves."
41,11,18,"And the scribes and chief priests heard  it , and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine."
41,11,19,"And when even was come, he went out of the city."
41,11,20,"And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots."
41,11,21,"And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away."
41,11,22,"And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God."
41,11,23,"For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith."
41,11,24,"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive  them , and ye shall have  them ."
41,11,25,"And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."
41,11,26,"But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses."
41,11,27,"And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,"
41,11,28,"And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?"
41,11,29,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
41,11,30,"The baptism of John, was  it  from heaven, or of men? answer me."
41,11,31,"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?"
41,11,32,"But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all  men  counted John, that he was a prophet indeed."
41,11,33,"And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."
41,12,1,"And he began to speak unto them by parables. A  certain  man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about  it , and digged  a place for  the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country."
41,12,2,"And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard."
41,12,3,"And they caught  him , and beat him, and sent  him  away empty."
41,12,4,"And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded  him  in the head, and sent  him  away shamefully handled."
41,12,5,"And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some."
41,12,6,"Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son."
41,12,7,"But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours."
41,12,8,"And they took him, and killed  him , and cast  him  out of the vineyard."
41,12,9,"What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others."
41,12,10,"And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:"
41,12,11,"This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?"
41,12,12,"And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way."
41,12,13,"And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in  his  words."
41,12,14,"And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?"
41,12,15,"Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see  it ."
41,12,16,"And they brought  it . And he saith unto them, Whose  is  this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s."
41,12,17,"And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him."
41,12,18,"Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,"
41,12,19,"Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave  his  wife  behind him , and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."
41,12,20,"Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed."
41,12,21,"And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise."
41,12,22,"And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also."
41,12,23,"In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife."
41,12,24,"And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?"
41,12,25,"For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven."
41,12,26,"And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I  am  the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?"
41,12,27,"He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err."
41,12,28,"And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?"
41,12,29,"And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments  is , Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:"
41,12,30,"And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this  is  the first commandment."
41,12,31,"And the second  is  like,  namely  this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these."
41,12,32,"And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:"
41,12,33,"And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love  his  neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
41,12,34,"And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him  any question ."
41,12,35,"And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?"
41,12,36,"For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool."
41,12,37,"David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he  then  his son? And the common people heard him gladly."
41,12,38,"And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and  love  salutations in the marketplaces,"
41,12,39,"And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:"
41,12,40,"Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation."
41,12,41,"And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much."
41,12,42,"And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing."
41,12,43,"And he called  unto him  his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:"
41,12,44,"For all  they  did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had,  even  all her living."
41,13,1,"And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings  are here !"
41,13,2,"And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
41,13,3,"And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,"
41,13,4,"Tell us, when shall these things be? and what  shall be  the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?"
41,13,5,"And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any  man  deceive you:"
41,13,6,"For many shall come in my name, saying, I am  Christ ; and shall deceive many."
41,13,7,"And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for  such things  must needs be; but the end  shall  not  be  yet."
41,13,8,"For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these  are  the beginnings of sorrows."
41,13,9,"But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them."
41,13,10,"And the gospel must first be published among all nations."
41,13,11,"But when they shall lead  you , and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost."
41,13,12,"Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against  their  parents, and shall cause them to be put to death."
41,13,13,"And ye shall be hated of all  men  for my name’s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."
41,13,14,"But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:"
41,13,15,"And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter  therein , to take any thing out of his house:"
41,13,16,"And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment."
41,13,17,"But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!"
41,13,18,"And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter."
41,13,19,"For  in  those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be."
41,13,20,"And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days."
41,13,21,"And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here  is  Christ; or, lo,  he is  there; believe  him  not:"
41,13,22,"For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if  it were  possible, even the elect."
41,13,23,"But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things."
41,13,24,"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,"
41,13,25,"And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken."
41,13,26,"And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory."
41,13,27,"And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven."
41,13,28,"Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:"
41,13,29,"So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh,  even  at the doors."
41,13,30,"Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done."
41,13,31,"Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away."
41,13,32,"But of that day and  that  hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father."
41,13,33,"Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is."
41,13,34,"For the Son of man is  as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch."
41,13,35,"Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:"
41,13,36,"Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping."
41,13,37,"And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch."
41,14,1,"After two days was  the feast of  the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put  him  to death."
41,14,2,"But they said, Not on the feast  day , lest there be an uproar of the people."
41,14,3,"And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured  it  on his head."
41,14,4,"And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?"
41,14,5,"For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her."
41,14,6,"And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me."
41,14,7,"For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always."
41,14,8,"She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying."
41,14,9,"Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world,  this  also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her."
41,14,10,"And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them."
41,14,11,"And when they heard  it , they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him."
41,14,12,"And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?"
41,14,13,"And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him."
41,14,14,"And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?"
41,14,15,"And he will shew you a large upper room furnished  and  prepared: there make ready for us."
41,14,16,"And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover."
41,14,17,"And in the evening he cometh with the twelve."
41,14,18,"And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me."
41,14,19,"And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one,  Is  it I? and another  said, Is  it I?"
41,14,20,"And he answered and said unto them,  It is  one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish."
41,14,21,"The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born."
41,14,22,"And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake  it , and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body."
41,14,23,"And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave  it  to them: and they all drank of it."
41,14,24,"And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many."
41,14,25,"Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
41,14,26,"And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives."
41,14,27,"And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered."
41,14,28,"But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee."
41,14,29,"But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet  will  not I."
41,14,30,"And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day,  even  in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice."
41,14,31,"But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all."
41,14,32,"And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray."
41,14,33,"And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;"
41,14,34,"And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch."
41,14,35,"And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him."
41,14,36,"And he said, Abba, Father, all things  are  possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt."
41,14,37,"And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?"
41,14,38,"Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly  is  ready, but the flesh  is  weak."
41,14,39,"And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words."
41,14,40,"And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him."
41,14,41,"And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take  your  rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
41,14,42,"Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand."
41,14,43,"And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders."
41,14,44,"And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead  him  away safely."
41,14,45,"And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him."
41,14,46,"And they laid their hands on him, and took him."
41,14,47,"And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear."
41,14,48,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and  with  staves to take me?"
41,14,49,"I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled."
41,14,50,"And they all forsook him, and fled."
41,14,51,"And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about  his  naked  body ; and the young men laid hold on him:"
41,14,52,"And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked."
41,14,53,"And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes."
41,14,54,"And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire."
41,14,55,"And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none."
41,14,56,"For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together."
41,14,57,"And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,"
41,14,58,"We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands."
41,14,59,"But neither so did their witness agree together."
41,14,60,"And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what  is it which  these witness against thee?"
41,14,61,"But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
41,14,62,"And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."
41,14,63,"Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?"
41,14,64,"Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death."
41,14,65,"And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands."
41,14,66,"And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:"
41,14,67,"And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth."
41,14,68,"But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew."
41,14,69,"And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is  one  of them."
41,14,70,"And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art  one  of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth  thereto ."
41,14,71,"But he began to curse and to swear,  saying , I know not this man of whom ye speak."
41,14,72,"And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept."
41,15,1,"And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried  him  away, and delivered  him  to Pilate."
41,15,2,"And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest  it ."
41,15,3,"And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing."
41,15,4,"And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee."
41,15,5,"But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled."
41,15,6,"Now at  that  feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired."
41,15,7,"And there was  one  named Barabbas,  which lay  bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection."
41,15,8,"And the multitude crying aloud began to desire  him to do  as he had ever done unto them."
41,15,9,"But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"
41,15,10,"For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy."
41,15,11,"But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them."
41,15,12,"And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do  unto him  whom ye call the King of the Jews?"
41,15,13,"And they cried out again, Crucify him."
41,15,14,"Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him."
41,15,15,"And  so  Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged  him , to be crucified."
41,15,16,"And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band."
41,15,17,"And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his  head ,"
41,15,18,"And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!"
41,15,19,"And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing  their  knees worshipped him."
41,15,20,"And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him."
41,15,21,"And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross."
41,15,22,"And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull."
41,15,23,"And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received  it  not."
41,15,24,"And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take."
41,15,25,"And it was the third hour, and they crucified him."
41,15,26,"And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
41,15,27,"And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left."
41,15,28,"And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors."
41,15,29,"And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest  it  in three days,"
41,15,30,"Save thyself, and come down from the cross."
41,15,31,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save."
41,15,32,"Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him."
41,15,33,"And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
41,15,34,"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
41,15,35,"And some of them that stood by, when they heard  it , said, Behold, he calleth Elias."
41,15,36,"And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put  it  on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down."
41,15,37,"And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost."
41,15,38,"And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom."
41,15,39,"And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God."
41,15,40,"There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;"
41,15,41,"(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem."
41,15,42,"And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,"
41,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus."
41,15,44,"And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling  unto him  the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead."
41,15,45,"And when he knew  it  of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph."
41,15,46,"And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre."
41,15,47,"And Mary Magdalene and Mary  the mother  of Joses beheld where he was laid."
41,16,1,"And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother  of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him."
41,16,2,"And very early in the morning the first  day  of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun."
41,16,3,"And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?"
41,16,4,"And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great."
41,16,5,"And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted."
41,16,6,"And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him."
41,16,7,"But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you."
41,16,8,"And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any  man ; for they were afraid."
41,16,9,"Now when  Jesus  was risen early the first  day  of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils."
41,16,10,"And  she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept."
41,16,11,"And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not."
41,16,12,"After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country."
41,16,13,"And they went and told  it  unto the residue: neither believed they them."
41,16,14,"Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen."
41,16,15,"And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."
41,16,16,"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned."
41,16,17,"And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;"
41,16,18,"They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."
41,16,19,"So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God."
41,16,20,"And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with  them , and confirming the word with signs following. Amen."
42,1,1,"Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,"
42,1,2,"Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;"
42,1,3,"It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,"
42,1,4,"That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed."
42,1,5,"There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife  was  of the daughters of Aaron, and her name  was  Elisabeth."
42,1,6,"And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless."
42,1,7,"And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were  now  well stricken in years."
42,1,8,"And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,"
42,1,9,"According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord."
42,1,10,"And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense."
42,1,11,"And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense."
42,1,12,"And when Zacharias saw  him , he was troubled, and fear fell upon him."
42,1,13,"But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John."
42,1,14,"And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth."
42,1,15,"For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb."
42,1,16,"And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God."
42,1,17,"And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
42,1,18,"And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years."
42,1,19,"And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings."
42,1,20,"And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season."
42,1,21,"And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple."
42,1,22,"And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless."
42,1,23,"And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house."
42,1,24,"And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,"
42,1,25,"Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on  me , to take away my reproach among men."
42,1,26,"And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,"
42,1,27,"To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name  was  Mary."
42,1,28,"And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail,  thou that art  highly favoured, the Lord  is  with thee: blessed  art  thou among women."
42,1,29,"And when she saw  him , she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be."
42,1,30,"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God."
42,1,31,"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS."
42,1,32,"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:"
42,1,33,"And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end."
42,1,34,"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"
42,1,35,"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."
42,1,36,"And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren."
42,1,37,"For with God nothing shall be impossible."
42,1,38,"And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her."
42,1,39,"And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;"
42,1,40,"And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth."
42,1,41,"And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:"
42,1,42,"And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed  art  thou among women, and blessed  is  the fruit of thy womb."
42,1,43,"And whence  is  this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"
42,1,44,"For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy."
42,1,45,"And blessed  is  she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord."
42,1,46,"And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,"
42,1,47,"And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour."
42,1,48,"For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed."
42,1,49,"For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy  is  his name."
42,1,50,"And his mercy  is  on them that fear him from generation to generation."
42,1,51,"He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts."
42,1,52,"He hath put down the mighty from  their  seats, and exalted them of low degree."
42,1,53,"He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away."
42,1,54,"He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of  his  mercy;"
42,1,55,"As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever."
42,1,56,"And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house."
42,1,57,"Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son."
42,1,58,"And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her."
42,1,59,"And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father."
42,1,60,"And his mother answered and said, Not  so ; but he shall be called John."
42,1,61,"And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name."
42,1,62,"And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called."
42,1,63,"And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all."
42,1,64,"And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue  loosed , and he spake, and praised God."
42,1,65,"And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea."
42,1,66,"And all they that heard  them  laid  them  up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him."
42,1,67,"And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,"
42,1,68,"Blessed  be  the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,"
42,1,69,"And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;"
42,1,70,"As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:"
42,1,71,"That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;"
42,1,72,"To perform the mercy  promised  to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;"
42,1,73,"The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,"
42,1,74,"That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,"
42,1,75,"In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life."
42,1,76,"And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;"
42,1,77,"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,"
42,1,78,"Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,"
42,1,79,"To give light to them that sit in darkness and  in  the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace."
42,1,80,"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel."
42,2,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed."
42,2,2,"( And  this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)"
42,2,3,"And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city."
42,2,4,"And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)"
42,2,5,"To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child."
42,2,6,"And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered."
42,2,7,"And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."
42,2,8,"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night."
42,2,9,"And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid."
42,2,10,"And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."
42,2,11,"For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord."
42,2,12,"And this  shall be  a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."
42,2,13,"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,"
42,2,14,"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."
42,2,15,"And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us."
42,2,16,"And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger."
42,2,17,"And when they had seen  it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child."
42,2,18,"And all they that heard  it  wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds."
42,2,19,"But Mary kept all these things, and pondered  them  in her heart."
42,2,20,"And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them."
42,2,21,"And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb."
42,2,22,"And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present  him  to the Lord;"
42,2,23,"(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)"
42,2,24,"And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."
42,2,25,"And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name  was  Simeon; and the same man  was  just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him."
42,2,26,"And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ."
42,2,27,"And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,"
42,2,28,"Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,"
42,2,29,"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:"
42,2,30,"For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,"
42,2,31,"Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;"
42,2,32,"A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel."
42,2,33,"And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him."
42,2,34,"And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this  child  is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;"
42,2,35,"(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
42,2,36,"And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;"
42,2,37,"And she  was  a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served  God  with fastings and prayers night and day."
42,2,38,"And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem."
42,2,39,"And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth."
42,2,40,"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him."
42,2,41,"Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover."
42,2,42,"And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast."
42,2,43,"And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not  of it ."
42,2,44,"But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among  their  kinsfolk and acquaintance."
42,2,45,"And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him."
42,2,46,"And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions."
42,2,47,"And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers."
42,2,48,"And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing."
42,2,49,"And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?"
42,2,50,"And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them."
42,2,51,"And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart."
42,2,52,"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man."
42,3,1,"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,"
42,3,2,"Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness."
42,3,3,"And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;"
42,3,4,"As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
42,3,5,"Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways  shall be  made smooth;"
42,3,6,"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God."
42,3,7,"Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
42,3,8,"Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to  our  father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham."
42,3,9,"And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
42,3,10,"And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?"
42,3,11,"He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise."
42,3,12,"Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?"
42,3,13,"And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you."
42,3,14,"And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse  any  falsely; and be content with your wages."
42,3,15,"And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;"
42,3,16,"John answered, saying unto  them  all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:"
42,3,17,"Whose fan  is  in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
42,3,18,"And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people."
42,3,19,"But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,"
42,3,20,"Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison."
42,3,21,"Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,"
42,3,22,"And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased."
42,3,23,"And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was  the son  of Heli,"
42,3,24,"Which was  the son  of Matthat, which was  the son  of Levi, which was  the son  of Melchi, which was  the son  of Janna, which was  the son  of Joseph,"
42,3,25,"Which was  the son  of Mattathias, which was  the son  of Amos, which was  the son  of Naum, which was  the son  of Esli, which was  the son  of Nagge,"
42,3,26,"Which was  the son  of Maath, which was  the son  of Mattathias, which was  the son  of Semei, which was  the son  of Joseph, which was  the son  of Juda,"
42,3,27,"Which was  the son  of Joanna, which was  the son  of Rhesa, which was  the son  of Zorobabel, which was  the son  of Salathiel, which was  the son  of Neri,"
42,3,28,"Which was  the son  of Melchi, which was  the son  of Addi, which was  the son  of Cosam, which was  the son  of Elmodam, which was  the son  of Er,"
42,3,29,"Which was  the son  of Jose, which was  the son  of Eliezer, which was  the son  of Jorim, which was  the son  of Matthat, which was  the son  of Levi,"
42,3,30,"Which was  the son  of Simeon, which was  the son  of Juda, which was  the son  of Joseph, which was  the son  of Jonan, which was  the son  of Eliakim,"
42,3,31,"Which was  the son  of Melea, which was  the son  of Menan, which was  the son  of Mattatha, which was  the son  of Nathan, which was  the son  of David,"
42,3,32,"Which was  the son  of Jesse, which was  the son  of Obed, which was  the son  of Booz, which was  the son  of Salmon, which was  the son  of Naasson,"
42,3,33,"Which was  the son  of Aminadab, which was  the son  of Aram, which was  the son  of Esrom, which was  the son  of Phares, which was  the son  of Juda,"
42,3,34,"Which was  the son  of Jacob, which was  the son  of Isaac, which was  the son  of Abraham, which was  the son  of Thara, which was  the son  of Nachor,"
42,3,35,"Which was  the son  of Saruch, which was  the son  of Ragau, which was  the son  of Phalec, which was  the son  of Heber, which was  the son  of Sala,"
42,3,36,"Which was  the son  of Cainan, which was  the son  of Arphaxad, which was  the son  of Sem, which was  the son  of Noe, which was  the son  of Lamech,"
42,3,37,"Which was  the son  of Mathusala, which was  the son  of Enoch, which was  the son  of Jared, which was  the son  of Maleleel, which was  the son  of Cainan,"
42,3,38,"Which was  the son  of Enos, which was  the son  of Seth, which was  the son  of Adam, which was  the son  of God."
42,4,1,"And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,"
42,4,2,"Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered."
42,4,3,"And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread."
42,4,4,"And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God."
42,4,5,"And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time."
42,4,6,"And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it."
42,4,7,"If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine."
42,4,8,"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."
42,4,9,"And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence:"
42,4,10,"For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:"
42,4,11,"And in  their  hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone."
42,4,12,"And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."
42,4,13,"And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season."
42,4,14,"And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about."
42,4,15,"And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all."
42,4,16,"And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read."
42,4,17,"And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,"
42,4,18,"The Spirit of the Lord  is  upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,"
42,4,19,"To preach the acceptable year of the Lord."
42,4,20,"And he closed the book, and he gave  it  again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him."
42,4,21,"And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
42,4,22,"And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?"
42,4,23,"And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country."
42,4,24,"And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country."
42,4,25,"But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;"
42,4,26,"But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta,  a city  of Sidon, unto a woman  that was  a widow."
42,4,27,"And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian."
42,4,28,"And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,"
42,4,29,"And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong."
42,4,30,"But he passing through the midst of them went his way,"
42,4,31,"And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days."
42,4,32,"And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power."
42,4,33,"And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,"
42,4,34,"Saying, Let  us  alone; what have we to do with thee,  thou  Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God."
42,4,35,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not."
42,4,36,"And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word  is  this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out."
42,4,37,"And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about."
42,4,38,"And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. And Simon’s wife’s mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her."
42,4,39,"And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them."
42,4,40,"Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them."
42,4,41,"And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking  them  suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ."
42,4,42,"And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them."
42,4,43,"And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent."
42,4,44,"And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee."
42,5,1,"And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,"
42,5,2,"And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing  their  nets."
42,5,3,"And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship."
42,5,4,"Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught."
42,5,5,"And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net."
42,5,6,"And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake."
42,5,7,"And they beckoned unto  their  partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink."
42,5,8,"When Simon Peter saw  it , he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
42,5,9,"For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:"
42,5,10,"And so  was  also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men."
42,5,11,"And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him."
42,5,12,"And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on  his  face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."
42,5,13,"And he put forth  his  hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him."
42,5,14,"And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them."
42,5,15,"But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities."
42,5,16,"And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed."
42,5,17,"And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was  present  to heal them."
42,5,18,"And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought  means  to bring him in, and to lay  him  before him."
42,5,19,"And when they could not find by what  way  they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with  his  couch into the midst before Jesus."
42,5,20,"And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee."
42,5,21,"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
42,5,22,"But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?"
42,5,23,"Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?"
42,5,24,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house."
42,5,25,"And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God."
42,5,26,"And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day."
42,5,27,"And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me."
42,5,28,"And he left all, rose up, and followed him."
42,5,29,"And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them."
42,5,30,"But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?"
42,5,31,"And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick."
42,5,32,"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
42,5,33,"And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise  the disciples  of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?"
42,5,34,"And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?"
42,5,35,"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days."
42,5,36,"And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was  taken  out of the new agreeth not with the old."
42,5,37,"And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish."
42,5,38,"But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved."
42,5,39,"No man also having drunk old  wine  straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better."
42,6,1,"And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing  them  in  their  hands."
42,6,2,"And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?"
42,6,3,"And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;"
42,6,4,"How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?"
42,6,5,"And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."
42,6,6,"And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered."
42,6,7,"And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him."
42,6,8,"But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth."
42,6,9,"Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy  it ?"
42,6,10,"And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other."
42,6,11,"And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus."
42,6,12,"And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God."
42,6,13,"And when it was day, he called  unto him  his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;"
42,6,14,"Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,"
42,6,15,"Matthew and Thomas, James the  son  of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,"
42,6,16,"And Judas  the brother  of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor."
42,6,17,"And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;"
42,6,18,"And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed."
42,6,19,"And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed  them  all."
42,6,20,"And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed  be ye  poor: for yours is the kingdom of God."
42,6,21,"Blessed  are ye  that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed  are ye  that weep now: for ye shall laugh."
42,6,22,"Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you  from their company , and shall reproach  you , and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake."
42,6,23,"Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward  is  great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets."
42,6,24,"But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation."
42,6,25,"Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep."
42,6,26,"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets."
42,6,27,"But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,"
42,6,28,"Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you."
42,6,29,"And unto him that smiteth thee on the  one  cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not  to take thy  coat also."
42,6,30,"Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask  them  not again."
42,6,31,"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise."
42,6,32,"For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them."
42,6,33,"And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same."
42,6,34,"And if ye lend  to them  of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again."
42,6,35,"But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and  to  the evil."
42,6,36,"Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful."
42,6,37,"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:"
42,6,38,"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."
42,6,39,"And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?"
42,6,40,"The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master."
42,6,41,"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"
42,6,42,"Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye."
42,6,43,"For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit."
42,6,44,"For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes."
42,6,45,"A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh."
42,6,46,"And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?"
42,6,47,"Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:"
42,6,48,"He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock."
42,6,49,"But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great."
42,7,1,"Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum."
42,7,2,"And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die."
42,7,3,"And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant."
42,7,4,"And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:"
42,7,5,"For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue."
42,7,6,"Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:"
42,7,7,"Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed."
42,7,8,"For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth  it ."
42,7,9,"When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."
42,7,10,"And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick."
42,7,11,"And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people."
42,7,12,"Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her."
42,7,13,"And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not."
42,7,14,"And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare  him  stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise."
42,7,15,"And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother."
42,7,16,"And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people."
42,7,17,"And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about."
42,7,18,"And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things."
42,7,19,"And John calling  unto him  two of his disciples sent  them  to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?"
42,7,20,"When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?"
42,7,21,"And in that same hour he cured many of  their  infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many  that were  blind he gave sight."
42,7,22,"Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached."
42,7,23,"And blessed is  he , whosoever shall not be offended in me."
42,7,24,"And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?"
42,7,25,"But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts."
42,7,26,"But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet."
42,7,27,"This is  he , of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee."
42,7,28,"For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
42,7,29,"And all the people that heard  him , and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John."
42,7,30,"But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him."
42,7,31,"And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?"
42,7,32,"They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept."
42,7,33,"For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil."
42,7,34,"The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!"
42,7,35,"But wisdom is justified of all her children."
42,7,36,"And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat."
42,7,37,"And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that  Jesus  sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,"
42,7,38,"And stood at his feet behind  him  weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe  them  with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed  them  with the ointment."
42,7,39,"Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw  it , he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman  this is  that toucheth him: for she is a sinner."
42,7,40,"And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on."
42,7,41,"There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty."
42,7,42,"And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?"
42,7,43,"Simon answered and said, I suppose that  he , to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged."
42,7,44,"And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped  them  with the hairs of her head."
42,7,45,"Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet."
42,7,46,"My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment."
42,7,47,"Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,  the same  loveth little."
42,7,48,"And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven."
42,7,49,"And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?"
42,7,50,"And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace."
42,8,1,"And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve  were  with him,"
42,8,2,"And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,"
42,8,3,"And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance."
42,8,4,"And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:"
42,8,5,"A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it."
42,8,6,"And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture."
42,8,7,"And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it."
42,8,8,"And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
42,8,9,"And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?"
42,8,10,"And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand."
42,8,11,"Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God."
42,8,12,"Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved."
42,8,13,"They on the rock  are they , which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away."
42,8,14,"And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of  this  life, and bring no fruit to perfection."
42,8,15,"But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep  it , and bring forth fruit with patience."
42,8,16,"No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth  it  under a bed; but setteth  it  on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light."
42,8,17,"For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither  any thing  hid, that shall not be known and come abroad."
42,8,18,"Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have."
42,8,19,"Then came to him  his  mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press."
42,8,20,"And it was told him  by certain  which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee."
42,8,21,"And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it."
42,8,22,"Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth."
42,8,23,"But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled  with water , and were in jeopardy."
42,8,24,"And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm."
42,8,25,"And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him."
42,8,26,"And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee."
42,8,27,"And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in  any  house, but in the tombs."
42,8,28,"When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,  thou  Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not."
42,8,29,"(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)"
42,8,30,"And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him."
42,8,31,"And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep."
42,8,32,"And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them."
42,8,33,"Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked."
42,8,34,"When they that fed  them  saw what was done, they fled, and went and told  it  in the city and in the country."
42,8,35,"Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid."
42,8,36,"They also which saw  it  told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed."
42,8,37,"Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again."
42,8,38,"Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,"
42,8,39,"Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him."
42,8,40,"And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people  gladly  received him: for they were all waiting for him."
42,8,41,"And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:"
42,8,42,"For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him."
42,8,43,"And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,"
42,8,44,"Came behind  him , and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched."
42,8,45,"And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press  thee , and sayest thou, Who touched me?"
42,8,46,"And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me."
42,8,47,"And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately."
42,8,48,"And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace."
42,8,49,"While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s  house , saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master."
42,8,50,"But when Jesus heard  it , he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole."
42,8,51,"And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden."
42,8,52,"And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth."
42,8,53,"And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead."
42,8,54,"And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise."
42,8,55,"And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat."
42,8,56,"And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done."
42,9,1,"Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases."
42,9,2,"And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick."
42,9,3,"And he said unto them, Take nothing for  your  journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece."
42,9,4,"And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart."
42,9,5,"And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them."
42,9,6,"And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where."
42,9,7,"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;"
42,9,8,"And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again."
42,9,9,"And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him."
42,9,10,"And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida."
42,9,11,"And the people, when they knew  it , followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing."
42,9,12,"And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place."
42,9,13,"But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people."
42,9,14,"For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company."
42,9,15,"And they did so, and made them all sit down."
42,9,16,"Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude."
42,9,17,"And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets."
42,9,18,"And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?"
42,9,19,"They answering said, John the Baptist; but some  say , Elias; and others  say , that one of the old prophets is risen again."
42,9,20,"He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God."
42,9,21,"And he straitly charged them, and commanded  them  to tell no man that thing;"
42,9,22,"Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day."
42,9,23,"And he said to  them  all, If any  man  will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me."
42,9,24,"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it."
42,9,25,"For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?"
42,9,26,"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and  in his  Father’s, and of the holy angels."
42,9,27,"But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God."
42,9,28,"And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray."
42,9,29,"And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment  was  white  and  glistering."
42,9,30,"And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:"
42,9,31,"Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem."
42,9,32,"But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him."
42,9,33,"And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said."
42,9,34,"While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud."
42,9,35,"And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him."
42,9,36,"And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept  it  close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen."
42,9,37,"And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him."
42,9,38,"And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child."
42,9,39,"And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him."
42,9,40,"And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not."
42,9,41,"And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither."
42,9,42,"And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare  him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father."
42,9,43,"And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,"
42,9,44,"Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men."
42,9,45,"But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying."
42,9,46,"Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest."
42,9,47,"And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,"
42,9,48,"And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great."
42,9,49,"And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us."
42,9,50,"And Jesus said unto him, Forbid  him  not: for he that is not against us is for us."
42,9,51,"And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,"
42,9,52,"And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him."
42,9,53,"And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem."
42,9,54,"And when his disciples James and John saw  this , they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?"
42,9,55,"But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of."
42,9,56,"For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save  them . And they went to another village."
42,9,57,"And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain  man  said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest."
42,9,58,"And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air  have  nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay  his  head."
42,9,59,"And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father."
42,9,60,"Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God."
42,9,61,"And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house."
42,9,62,"And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."
42,10,1,"After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come."
42,10,2,"Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly  is  great, but the labourers  are  few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest."
42,10,3,"Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves."
42,10,4,"Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way."
42,10,5,"And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace  be  to this house."
42,10,6,"And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again."
42,10,7,"And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house."
42,10,8,"And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:"
42,10,9,"And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."
42,10,10,"But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,"
42,10,11,"Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."
42,10,12,"But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city."
42,10,13,"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
42,10,14,"But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you."
42,10,15,"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell."
42,10,16,"He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me."
42,10,17,"And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name."
42,10,18,"And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven."
42,10,19,"Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you."
42,10,20,"Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven."
42,10,21,"In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight."
42,10,22,"All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and  he  to whom the Son will reveal  him ."
42,10,23,"And he turned him unto  his  disciples, and said privately, Blessed  are  the eyes which see the things that ye see:"
42,10,24,"For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen  them ; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard  them ."
42,10,25,"And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
42,10,26,"He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?"
42,10,27,"And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself."
42,10,28,"And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live."
42,10,29,"But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?"
42,10,30,"And Jesus answering said, A certain  man  went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded  him , and departed, leaving  him  half dead."
42,10,31,"And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side."
42,10,32,"And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked  on him , and passed by on the other side."
42,10,33,"But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion  on him ,"
42,10,34,"And went to  him , and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him."
42,10,35,"And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave  them  to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee."
42,10,36,"Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?"
42,10,37,"And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise."
42,10,38,"Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house."
42,10,39,"And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word."
42,10,40,"But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me."
42,10,41,"And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:"
42,10,42,"But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."
42,11,1,"And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples."
42,11,2,"And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth."
42,11,3,"Give us day by day our daily bread."
42,11,4,"And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil."
42,11,5,"And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;"
42,11,6,"For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?"
42,11,7,"And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee."
42,11,8,"I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth."
42,11,9,"And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."
42,11,10,"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."
42,11,11,"If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if  he ask  a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?"
42,11,12,"Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?"
42,11,13,"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall  your  heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?"
42,11,14,"And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered."
42,11,15,"But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils."
42,11,16,"And others, tempting  him , sought of him a sign from heaven."
42,11,17,"But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house  divided  against a house falleth."
42,11,18,"If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub."
42,11,19,"And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast  them  out? therefore shall they be your judges."
42,11,20,"But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you."
42,11,21,"When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:"
42,11,22,"But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils."
42,11,23,"He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth."
42,11,24,"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out."
42,11,25,"And when he cometh, he findeth  it  swept and garnished."
42,11,26,"Then goeth he, and taketh  to him  seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last  state  of that man is worse than the first."
42,11,27,"And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed  is  the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked."
42,11,28,"But he said, Yea rather, blessed  are  they that hear the word of God, and keep it."
42,11,29,"And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet."
42,11,30,"For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation."
42,11,31,"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon  is  here."
42,11,32,"The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas  is  here."
42,11,33,"No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth  it  in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light."
42,11,34,"The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when  thine eye  is evil, thy body also  is  full of darkness."
42,11,35,"Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness."
42,11,36,"If thy whole body therefore  be  full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light."
42,11,37,"And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat."
42,11,38,"And when the Pharisee saw  it , he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner."
42,11,39,"And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness."
42,11,40,"Ye  fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?"
42,11,41,"But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you."
42,11,42,"But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."
42,11,43,"Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets."
42,11,44,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over  them  are not aware  of them ."
42,11,45,"Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also."
42,11,46,"And he said, Woe unto you also,  ye  lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers."
42,11,47,"Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them."
42,11,48,"Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres."
42,11,49,"Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and  some  of them they shall slay and persecute:"
42,11,50,"That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;"
42,11,51,"From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation."
42,11,52,"Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered."
42,11,53,"And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge  him  vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:"
42,11,54,"Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him."
42,12,1,"In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
42,12,2,"For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known."
42,12,3,"Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops."
42,12,4,"And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do."
42,12,5,"But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him."
42,12,6,"Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?"
42,12,7,"But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows."
42,12,8,"Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:"
42,12,9,"But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God."
42,12,10,"And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven."
42,12,11,"And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and  unto  magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:"
42,12,12,"For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say."
42,12,13,"And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me."
42,12,14,"And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?"
42,12,15,"And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."
42,12,16,"And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:"
42,12,17,"And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?"
42,12,18,"And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods."
42,12,19,"And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink,  and  be merry."
42,12,20,"But God said unto him,  Thou  fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?"
42,12,21,"So  is  he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."
42,12,22,"And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on."
42,12,23,"The life is more than meat, and the body  is more  than raiment."
42,12,24,"Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?"
42,12,25,"And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?"
42,12,26,"If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?"
42,12,27,"Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
42,12,28,"If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more  will he clothe  you, O ye of little faith?"
42,12,29,"And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind."
42,12,30,"For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things."
42,12,31,"But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you."
42,12,32,"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom."
42,12,33,"Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth."
42,12,34,"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
42,12,35,"Let your loins be girded about, and  your  lights burning;"
42,12,36,"And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately."
42,12,37,"Blessed  are  those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them."
42,12,38,"And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find  them  so, blessed are those servants."
42,12,39,"And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through."
42,12,40,"Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not."
42,12,41,"Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?"
42,12,42,"And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom  his  lord shall make ruler over his household, to give  them their  portion of meat in due season?"
42,12,43,"Blessed  is  that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing."
42,12,44,"Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath."
42,12,45,"But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;"
42,12,46,"The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for  him , and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers."
42,12,47,"And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not  himself , neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many  stripes ."
42,12,48,"But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few  stripes . For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more."
42,12,49,"I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?"
42,12,50,"But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!"
42,12,51,"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:"
42,12,52,"For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three."
42,12,53,"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."
42,12,54,"And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is."
42,12,55,"And when  ye see  the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass."
42,12,56,"Ye  hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?"
42,12,57,"Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?"
42,12,58,"When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate,  as thou art  in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison."
42,12,59,"I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite."
42,13,1,"There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices."
42,13,2,"And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?"
42,13,3,"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."
42,13,4,"Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?"
42,13,5,"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."
42,13,6,"He spake also this parable; A certain  man  had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none."
42,13,7,"Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?"
42,13,8,"And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung  it :"
42,13,9,"And if it bear fruit,  well : and if not,  then  after that thou shalt cut it down."
42,13,10,"And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath."
42,13,11,"And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up  herself ."
42,13,12,"And when Jesus saw her, he called  her to him , and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity."
42,13,13,"And he laid  his  hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God."
42,13,14,"And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day."
42,13,15,"The Lord then answered him, and said,  Thou  hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or  his  ass from the stall, and lead  him  away to watering?"
42,13,16,"And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?"
42,13,17,"And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him."
42,13,18,"Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?"
42,13,19,"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it."
42,13,20,"And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?"
42,13,21,"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
42,13,22,"And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem."
42,13,23,"Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,"
42,13,24,"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able."
42,13,25,"When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:"
42,13,26,"Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets."
42,13,27,"But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all  ye  workers of iniquity."
42,13,28,"There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you  yourselves  thrust out."
42,13,29,"And they shall come from the east, and  from  the west, and from the north, and  from  the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God."
42,13,30,"And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last."
42,13,31,"The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee."
42,13,32,"And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third  day  I shall be perfected."
42,13,33,"Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the  day  following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem."
42,13,34,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen  doth gather  her brood under  her  wings, and ye would not!"
42,13,35,"Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until  the time  come when ye shall say, Blessed  is  he that cometh in the name of the Lord."
42,14,1,"And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him."
42,14,2,"And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy."
42,14,3,"And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?"
42,14,4,"And they held their peace. And he took  him , and healed him, and let him go;"
42,14,5,"And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?"
42,14,6,"And they could not answer him again to these things."
42,14,7,"And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,"
42,14,8,"When thou art bidden of any  man  to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;"
42,14,9,"And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room."
42,14,10,"But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee."
42,14,11,"For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
42,14,12,"Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor  thy  rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee."
42,14,13,"But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:"
42,14,14,"And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just."
42,14,15,"And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed  is  he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God."
42,14,16,"Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:"
42,14,17,"And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready."
42,14,18,"And they all with one  consent  began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused."
42,14,19,"And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused."
42,14,20,"And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come."
42,14,21,"So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind."
42,14,22,"And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room."
42,14,23,"And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel  them  to come in, that my house may be filled."
42,14,24,"For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper."
42,14,25,"And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,"
42,14,26,"If any  man  come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."
42,14,27,"And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple."
42,14,28,"For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have  sufficient  to finish  it ?"
42,14,29,"Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish  it , all that behold  it  begin to mock him,"
42,14,30,"Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish."
42,14,31,"Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?"
42,14,32,"Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace."
42,14,33,"So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple."
42,14,34,"Salt  is  good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?"
42,14,35,"It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill;  but  men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
42,15,1,"Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him."
42,15,2,"And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them."
42,15,3,"And he spake this parable unto them, saying,"
42,15,4,"What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?"
42,15,5,"And when he hath found  it , he layeth  it  on his shoulders, rejoicing."
42,15,6,"And when he cometh home, he calleth together  his  friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost."
42,15,7,"I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance."
42,15,8,"Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find  it ?"
42,15,9,"And when she hath found  it , she calleth  her  friends and  her  neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost."
42,15,10,"Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth."
42,15,11,"And he said, A certain man had two sons:"
42,15,12,"And the younger of them said to  his  father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth  to me . And he divided unto them  his  living."
42,15,13,"And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living."
42,15,14,"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want."
42,15,15,"And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine."
42,15,16,"And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him."
42,15,17,"And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!"
42,15,18,"I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,"
42,15,19,"And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants."
42,15,20,"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him."
42,15,21,"And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son."
42,15,22,"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put  it  on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on  his  feet:"
42,15,23,"And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill  it ; and let us eat, and be merry:"
42,15,24,"For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry."
42,15,25,"Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing."
42,15,26,"And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant."
42,15,27,"And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound."
42,15,28,"And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him."
42,15,29,"And he answering said to  his  father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:"
42,15,30,"But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf."
42,15,31,"And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine."
42,15,32,"It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found."
42,16,1,"And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods."
42,16,2,"And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward."
42,16,3,"Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed."
42,16,4,"I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses."
42,16,5,"So he called every one of his lord’s debtors  unto him , and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?"
42,16,6,"And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty."
42,16,7,"Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore."
42,16,8,"And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light."
42,16,9,"And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations."
42,16,10,"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much."
42,16,11,"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true  riches ?"
42,16,12,"And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?"
42,16,13,"No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."
42,16,14,"And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him."
42,16,15,"And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God."
42,16,16,"The law and the prophets  were  until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it."
42,16,17,"And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."
42,16,18,"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from  her  husband committeth adultery."
42,16,19,"There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:"
42,16,20,"And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,"
42,16,21,"And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores."
42,16,22,"And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;"
42,16,23,"And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."
42,16,24,"And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."
42,16,25,"But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented."
42,16,26,"And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that  would come  from thence."
42,16,27,"Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:"
42,16,28,"For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment."
42,16,29,"Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."
42,16,30,"And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent."
42,16,31,"And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."
42,17,1,"Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe  unto him , through whom they come!"
42,17,2,"It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones."
42,17,3,"Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him."
42,17,4,"And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him."
42,17,5,"And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith."
42,17,6,"And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you."
42,17,7,"But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?"
42,17,8,"And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?"
42,17,9,"Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not."
42,17,10,"So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do."
42,17,11,"And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee."
42,17,12,"And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:"
42,17,13,"And they lifted up  their  voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us."
42,17,14,"And when he saw  them , he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed."
42,17,15,"And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,"
42,17,16,"And fell down on  his  face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan."
42,17,17,"And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where  are  the nine?"
42,17,18,"There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger."
42,17,19,"And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole."
42,17,20,"And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:"
42,17,21,"Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you."
42,17,22,"And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see  it ."
42,17,23,"And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after  them , nor follow  them ."
42,17,24,"For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one  part  under heaven, shineth unto the other  part  under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day."
42,17,25,"But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation."
42,17,26,"And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man."
42,17,27,"They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all."
42,17,28,"Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;"
42,17,29,"But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed  them  all."
42,17,30,"Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed."
42,17,31,"In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back."
42,17,32,"Remember Lot’s wife."
42,17,33,"Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it."
42,17,34,"I tell you, in that night there shall be two  men  in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left."
42,17,35,"Two  women  shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
42,17,36,"Two  men  shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
42,17,37,"And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body  is , thither will the eagles be gathered together."
42,18,1,"And he spake a parable unto them  to this end , that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;"
42,18,2,"Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:"
42,18,3,"And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary."
42,18,4,"And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;"
42,18,5,"Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me."
42,18,6,"And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith."
42,18,7,"And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?"
42,18,8,"I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?"
42,18,9,"And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:"
42,18,10,"Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican."
42,18,11,"The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men  are , extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican."
42,18,12,"I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess."
42,18,13,"And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as  his  eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner."
42,18,14,"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified  rather  than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
42,18,15,"And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when  his  disciples saw  it , they rebuked them."
42,18,16,"But Jesus called them  unto him , and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God."
42,18,17,"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein."
42,18,18,"And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
42,18,19,"And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none  is  good, save one,  that is , God."
42,18,20,"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother."
42,18,21,"And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up."
42,18,22,"Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me."
42,18,23,"And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich."
42,18,24,"And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!"
42,18,25,"For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
42,18,26,"And they that heard  it  said, Who then can be saved?"
42,18,27,"And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."
42,18,28,"Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee."
42,18,29,"And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,"
42,18,30,"Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting."
42,18,31,"Then he took  unto him  the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished."
42,18,32,"For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:"
42,18,33,"And they shall scourge  him , and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again."
42,18,34,"And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken."
42,18,35,"And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:"
42,18,36,"And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant."
42,18,37,"And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."
42,18,38,"And he cried, saying, Jesus,  thou  Son of David, have mercy on me."
42,18,39,"And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more,  Thou  Son of David, have mercy on me."
42,18,40,"And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,"
42,18,41,"Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight."
42,18,42,"And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee."
42,18,43,"And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw  it , gave praise unto God."
42,19,1,"And  Jesus  entered and passed through Jericho."
42,19,2,"And, behold,  there was  a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich."
42,19,3,"And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature."
42,19,4,"And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that  way ."
42,19,5,"And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house."
42,19,6,"And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully."
42,19,7,"And when they saw  it , they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner."
42,19,8,"And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore  him  fourfold."
42,19,9,"And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham."
42,19,10,"For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."
42,19,11,"And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear."
42,19,12,"He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return."
42,19,13,"And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come."
42,19,14,"But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this  man  to reign over us."
42,19,15,"And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading."
42,19,16,"Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds."
42,19,17,"And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities."
42,19,18,"And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds."
42,19,19,"And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities."
42,19,20,"And another came, saying, Lord, behold,  here is  thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:"
42,19,21,"For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow."
42,19,22,"And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee,  thou  wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:"
42,19,23,"Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?"
42,19,24,"And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give  it  to him that hath ten pounds."
42,19,25,"(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)"
42,19,26,"For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him."
42,19,27,"But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay  them  before me."
42,19,28,"And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem."
42,19,29,"And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called  the mount  of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,"
42,19,30,"Saying, Go ye into the village over against  you ; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring  him hither ."
42,19,31,"And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose  him ? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him."
42,19,32,"And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them."
42,19,33,"And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?"
42,19,34,"And they said, The Lord hath need of him."
42,19,35,"And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon."
42,19,36,"And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way."
42,19,37,"And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;"
42,19,38,"Saying, Blessed  be  the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest."
42,19,39,"And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples."
42,19,40,"And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out."
42,19,41,"And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,"
42,19,42,"Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things  which belong  unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes."
42,19,43,"For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,"
42,19,44,"And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation."
42,19,45,"And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;"
42,19,46,"Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves."
42,19,47,"And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,"
42,19,48,"And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him."
42,20,1,"And it came to pass,  that  on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon  him  with the elders,"
42,20,2,"And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?"
42,20,3,"And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:"
42,20,4,"The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?"
42,20,5,"And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?"
42,20,6,"But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet."
42,20,7,"And they answered, that they could not tell whence  it was ."
42,20,8,"And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things."
42,20,9,"Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time."
42,20,10,"And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent  him  away empty."
42,20,11,"And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated  him  shamefully, and sent  him  away empty."
42,20,12,"And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast  him  out."
42,20,13,"Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence  him  when they see him."
42,20,14,"But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours."
42,20,15,"So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed  him . What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?"
42,20,16,"He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard  it , they said, God forbid."
42,20,17,"And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?"
42,20,18,"Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
42,20,19,"And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them."
42,20,20,"And they watched  him , and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor."
42,20,21,"And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person  of any , but teachest the way of God truly:"
42,20,22,"Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?"
42,20,23,"But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?"
42,20,24,"Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar’s."
42,20,25,"And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s."
42,20,26,"And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace."
42,20,27,"Then came to  him  certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,"
42,20,28,"Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother."
42,20,29,"There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children."
42,20,30,"And the second took her to wife, and he died childless."
42,20,31,"And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died."
42,20,32,"Last of all the woman died also."
42,20,33,"Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife."
42,20,34,"And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:"
42,20,35,"But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:"
42,20,36,"Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection."
42,20,37,"Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."
42,20,38,"For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him."
42,20,39,"Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said."
42,20,40,"And after that they durst not ask him any  question at all ."
42,20,41,"And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?"
42,20,42,"And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,"
42,20,43,"Till I make thine enemies thy footstool."
42,20,44,"David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?"
42,20,45,"Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,"
42,20,46,"Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;"
42,20,47,"Which devour widows’ houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation."
42,21,1,"And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury."
42,21,2,"And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites."
42,21,3,"And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:"
42,21,4,"For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had."
42,21,5,"And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,"
42,21,6,"As for  these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down."
42,21,7,"And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign  will there be  when these things shall come to pass?"
42,21,8,"And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am  Christ ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them."
42,21,9,"But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end  is  not by and by."
42,21,10,"Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:"
42,21,11,"And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven."
42,21,12,"But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute  you , delivering  you  up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake."
42,21,13,"And it shall turn to you for a testimony."
42,21,14,"Settle  it  therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:"
42,21,15,"For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist."
42,21,16,"And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and  some  of you shall they cause to be put to death."
42,21,17,"And ye shall be hated of all  men  for my name’s sake."
42,21,18,"But there shall not an hair of your head perish."
42,21,19,"In your patience possess ye your souls."
42,21,20,"And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh."
42,21,21,"Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto."
42,21,22,"For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled."
42,21,23,"But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people."
42,21,24,"And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled."
42,21,25,"And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;"
42,21,26,"Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken."
42,21,27,"And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory."
42,21,28,"And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh."
42,21,29,"And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;"
42,21,30,"When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand."
42,21,31,"So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand."
42,21,32,"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled."
42,21,33,"Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away."
42,21,34,"And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and  so  that day come upon you unawares."
42,21,35,"For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth."
42,21,36,"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man."
42,21,37,"And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called  the mount  of Olives."
42,21,38,"And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him."
42,22,1,"Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover."
42,22,2,"And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people."
42,22,3,"Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve."
42,22,4,"And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them."
42,22,5,"And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money."
42,22,6,"And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude."
42,22,7,"Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed."
42,22,8,"And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat."
42,22,9,"And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?"
42,22,10,"And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in."
42,22,11,"And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?"
42,22,12,"And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready."
42,22,13,"And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover."
42,22,14,"And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him."
42,22,15,"And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:"
42,22,16,"For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
42,22,17,"And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide  it  among yourselves:"
42,22,18,"For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come."
42,22,19,"And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake  it , and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me."
42,22,20,"Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup  is  the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you."
42,22,21,"But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me  is  with me on the table."
42,22,22,"And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!"
42,22,23,"And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing."
42,22,24,"And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest."
42,22,25,"And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors."
42,22,26,"But ye  shall  not  be  so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve."
42,22,27,"For whether  is  greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth?  is  not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth."
42,22,28,"Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations."
42,22,29,"And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;"
42,22,30,"That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
42,22,31,"And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired  to have  you, that he may sift  you  as wheat:"
42,22,32,"But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren."
42,22,33,"And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death."
42,22,34,"And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me."
42,22,35,"And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing."
42,22,36,"Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take  it , and likewise  his  scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one."
42,22,37,"For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end."
42,22,38,"And they said, Lord, behold, here  are  two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough."
42,22,39,"And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him."
42,22,40,"And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation."
42,22,41,"And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,"
42,22,42,"Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done."
42,22,43,"And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him."
42,22,44,"And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground."
42,22,45,"And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,"
42,22,46,"And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation."
42,22,47,"And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him."
42,22,48,"But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?"
42,22,49,"When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?"
42,22,50,"And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear."
42,22,51,"And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him."
42,22,52,"Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?"
42,22,53,"When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
42,22,54,"Then took they him, and led  him , and brought him into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off."
42,22,55,"And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them."
42,22,56,"But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him."
42,22,57,"And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not."
42,22,58,"And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not."
42,22,59,"And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this  fellow  also was with him: for he is a Galilaean."
42,22,60,"And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew."
42,22,61,"And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice."
42,22,62,"And Peter went out, and wept bitterly."
42,22,63,"And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote  him ."
42,22,64,"And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?"
42,22,65,"And many other things blasphemously spake they against him."
42,22,66,"And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,"
42,22,67,"Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:"
42,22,68,"And if I also ask  you , ye will not answer me, nor let  me  go."
42,22,69,"Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God."
42,22,70,"Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am."
42,22,71,"And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth."
42,23,1,"And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate."
42,23,2,"And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this  fellow  perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King."
42,23,3,"And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest  it ."
42,23,4,"Then said Pilate to the chief priests and  to  the people, I find no fault in this man."
42,23,5,"And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place."
42,23,6,"When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean."
42,23,7,"And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time."
42,23,8,"And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long  season , because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him."
42,23,9,"Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing."
42,23,10,"And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him."
42,23,11,"And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked  him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate."
42,23,12,"And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves."
42,23,13,"And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,"
42,23,14,"Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined  him  before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:"
42,23,15,"No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him."
42,23,16,"I will therefore chastise him, and release  him ."
42,23,17,"(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)"
42,23,18,"And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this  man , and release unto us Barabbas:"
42,23,19,"(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)"
42,23,20,"Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them."
42,23,21,"But they cried, saying, Crucify  him , crucify him."
42,23,22,"And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let  him  go."
42,23,23,"And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed."
42,23,24,"And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required."
42,23,25,"And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will."
42,23,26,"And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear  it  after Jesus."
42,23,27,"And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him."
42,23,28,"But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children."
42,23,29,"For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed  are  the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck."
42,23,30,"Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us."
42,23,31,"For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?"
42,23,32,"And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death."
42,23,33,"And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left."
42,23,34,"Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots."
42,23,35,"And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided  him , saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God."
42,23,36,"And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,"
42,23,37,"And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself."
42,23,38,"And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
42,23,39,"And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us."
42,23,40,"But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?"
42,23,41,"And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss."
42,23,42,"And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."
42,23,43,"And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise."
42,23,44,"And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour."
42,23,45,"And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst."
42,23,46,"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."
42,23,47,"Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man."
42,23,48,"And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned."
42,23,49,"And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things."
42,23,50,"And, behold,  there was  a man named Joseph, a counseller;  and he was  a good man, and a just:"
42,23,51,"(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;)  he was  of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God."
42,23,52,"This  man  went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus."
42,23,53,"And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid."
42,23,54,"And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on."
42,23,55,"And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid."
42,23,56,"And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment."
42,24,1,"Now upon the first  day  of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain  others  with them."
42,24,2,"And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre."
42,24,3,"And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus."
42,24,4,"And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:"
42,24,5,"And as they were afraid, and bowed down  their  faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?"
42,24,6,"He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,"
42,24,7,"Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again."
42,24,8,"And they remembered his words,"
42,24,9,"And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest."
42,24,10,"It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary  the mother  of James, and other  women that were  with them, which told these things unto the apostles."
42,24,11,"And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not."
42,24,12,"Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass."
42,24,13,"And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem  about  threescore furlongs."
42,24,14,"And they talked together of all these things which had happened."
42,24,15,"And it came to pass, that, while they communed  together  and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them."
42,24,16,"But their eyes were holden that they should not know him."
42,24,17,"And he said unto them, What manner of communications  are  these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?"
42,24,18,"And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?"
42,24,19,"And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:"
42,24,20,"And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him."
42,24,21,"But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done."
42,24,22,"Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;"
42,24,23,"And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive."
42,24,24,"And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found  it  even so as the women had said: but him they saw not."
42,24,25,"Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:"
42,24,26,"Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?"
42,24,27,"And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself."
42,24,28,"And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further."
42,24,29,"But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them."
42,24,30,"And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed  it , and brake, and gave to them."
42,24,31,"And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight."
42,24,32,"And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?"
42,24,33,"And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,"
42,24,34,"Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon."
42,24,35,"And they told what things  were done  in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread."
42,24,36,"And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace  be  unto you."
42,24,37,"But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit."
42,24,38,"And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?"
42,24,39,"Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have."
42,24,40,"And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them  his  hands and  his  feet."
42,24,41,"And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?"
42,24,42,"And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb."
42,24,43,"And he took  it , and did eat before them."
42,24,44,"And he said unto them, These  are  the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and  in  the prophets, and  in  the psalms, concerning me."
42,24,45,"Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,"
42,24,46,"And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:"
42,24,47,"And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."
42,24,48,"And ye are witnesses of these things."
42,24,49,"And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high."
42,24,50,"And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them."
42,24,51,"And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven."
42,24,52,"And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:"
42,24,53,"And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen."
43,1,1,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
43,1,2,"The same was in the beginning with God."
43,1,3,"All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made."
43,1,4,"In him was life; and the life was the light of men."
43,1,5,"And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not."
43,1,6,"There was a man sent from God, whose name  was  John."
43,1,7,"The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all  men  through him might believe."
43,1,8,"He was not that Light, but  was sent  to bear witness of that Light."
43,1,9,"That  was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world."
43,1,10,"He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not."
43,1,11,"He came unto his own, and his own received him not."
43,1,12,"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God,  even  to them that believe on his name:"
43,1,13,"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
43,1,14,"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."
43,1,15,"John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me."
43,1,16,"And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace."
43,1,17,"For the law was given by Moses,  but  grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
43,1,18,"No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared  him ."
43,1,19,"And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?"
43,1,20,"And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ."
43,1,21,"And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No."
43,1,22,"Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?"
43,1,23,"He said, I  am  the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias."
43,1,24,"And they which were sent were of the Pharisees."
43,1,25,"And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?"
43,1,26,"John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;"
43,1,27,"He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose."
43,1,28,"These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing."
43,1,29,"The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world."
43,1,30,"This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me."
43,1,31,"And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water."
43,1,32,"And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him."
43,1,33,"And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."
43,1,34,"And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God."
43,1,35,"Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;"
43,1,36,"And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!"
43,1,37,"And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus."
43,1,38,"Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?"
43,1,39,"He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour."
43,1,40,"One of the two which heard John  speak , and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother."
43,1,41,"He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ."
43,1,42,"And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone."
43,1,43,"The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me."
43,1,44,"Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."
43,1,45,"Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
43,1,46,"And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see."
43,1,47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"
43,1,48,"Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee."
43,1,49,"Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel."
43,1,50,"Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these."
43,1,51,"And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."
43,2,1,"And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:"
43,2,2,"And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage."
43,2,3,"And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine."
43,2,4,"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come."
43,2,5,"His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do  it ."
43,2,6,"And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece."
43,2,7,"Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim."
43,2,8,"And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare  it ."
43,2,9,"When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,"
43,2,10,"And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse:  but  thou hast kept the good wine until now."
43,2,11,"This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him."
43,2,12,"After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days."
43,2,13,"And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,"
43,2,14,"And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:"
43,2,15,"And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;"
43,2,16,"And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise."
43,2,17,"And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up."
43,2,18,"Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?"
43,2,19,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
43,2,20,"Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?"
43,2,21,"But he spake of the temple of his body."
43,2,22,"When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said."
43,2,23,"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast  day , many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did."
43,2,24,"But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all  men ,"
43,2,25,"And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man."
43,3,1,"There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:"
43,3,2,"The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him."
43,3,3,"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
43,3,4,"Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?"
43,3,5,"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and  of  the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
43,3,6,"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
43,3,7,"Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again."
43,3,8,"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit."
43,3,9,"Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?"
43,3,10,"Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?"
43,3,11,"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness."
43,3,12,"If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you  of  heavenly things?"
43,3,13,"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,  even  the Son of man which is in heaven."
43,3,14,"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:"
43,3,15,"That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life."
43,3,16,"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
43,3,17,"For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved."
43,3,18,"He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."
43,3,19,"And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."
43,3,20,"For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved."
43,3,21,"But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God."
43,3,22,"After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized."
43,3,23,"And John also was baptizing in AEnon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized."
43,3,24,"For John was not yet cast into prison."
43,3,25,"Then there arose a question between  some  of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying."
43,3,26,"And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all  men  come to him."
43,3,27,"John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven."
43,3,28,"Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him."
43,3,29,"He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled."
43,3,30,"He must increase, but I  must  decrease."
43,3,31,"He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all."
43,3,32,"And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony."
43,3,33,"He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true."
43,3,34,"For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure  unto him ."
43,3,35,"The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand."
43,3,36,"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him."
43,4,1,"When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,"
43,4,2,"(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)"
43,4,3,"He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee."
43,4,4,"And he must needs go through Samaria."
43,4,5,"Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph."
43,4,6,"Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with  his  journey, sat thus on the well:  and  it was about the sixth hour."
43,4,7,"There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink."
43,4,8,"(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)"
43,4,9,"Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans."
43,4,10,"Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water."
43,4,11,"The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?"
43,4,12,"Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?"
43,4,13,"Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:"
43,4,14,"But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life."
43,4,15,"The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw."
43,4,16,"Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither."
43,4,17,"The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:"
43,4,18,"For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly."
43,4,19,"The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet."
43,4,20,"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."
43,4,21,"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father."
43,4,22,"Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews."
43,4,23,"But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him."
43,4,24,"God  is  a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship  him  in spirit and in truth."
43,4,25,"The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things."
43,4,26,"Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am  he ."
43,4,27,"And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?"
43,4,28,"The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,"
43,4,29,"Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?"
43,4,30,"Then they went out of the city, and came unto him."
43,4,31,"In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat."
43,4,32,"But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of."
43,4,33,"Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him  ought  to eat?"
43,4,34,"Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work."
43,4,35,"Say not ye, There are yet four months, and  then  cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest."
43,4,36,"And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together."
43,4,37,"And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth."
43,4,38,"I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours."
43,4,39,"And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did."
43,4,40,"So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days."
43,4,41,"And many more believed because of his own word;"
43,4,42,"And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard  him  ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world."
43,4,43,"Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee."
43,4,44,"For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country."
43,4,45,"Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast."
43,4,46,"So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum."
43,4,47,"When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death."
43,4,48,"Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe."
43,4,49,"The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die."
43,4,50,"Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way."
43,4,51,"And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told  him , saying, Thy son liveth."
43,4,52,"Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."
43,4,53,"So the father knew that  it was  at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house."
43,4,54,"This  is  again the second miracle  that  Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee."
43,5,1,"After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
43,5,2,"Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep  market  a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches."
43,5,3,"In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water."
43,5,4,"For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had."
43,5,5,"And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years."
43,5,6,"When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time  in that case , he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?"
43,5,7,"The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me."
43,5,8,"Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk."
43,5,9,"And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath."
43,5,10,"The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry  thy  bed."
43,5,11,"He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk."
43,5,12,"Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?"
43,5,13,"And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in  that  place."
43,5,14,"Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee."
43,5,15,"The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole."
43,5,16,"And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day."
43,5,17,"But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work."
43,5,18,"Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God."
43,5,19,"Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise."
43,5,20,"For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel."
43,5,21,"For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth  them ; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will."
43,5,22,"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:"
43,5,23,"That all  men  should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him."
43,5,24,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life."
43,5,25,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live."
43,5,26,"For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;"
43,5,27,"And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man."
43,5,28,"Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,"
43,5,29,"And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."
43,5,30,"I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me."
43,5,31,"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true."
43,5,32,"There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true."
43,5,33,"Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth."
43,5,34,"But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved."
43,5,35,"He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light."
43,5,36,"But I have greater witness than  that  of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me."
43,5,37,"And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape."
43,5,38,"And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not."
43,5,39,"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me."
43,5,40,"And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life."
43,5,41,"I receive not honour from men."
43,5,42,"But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you."
43,5,43,"I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive."
43,5,44,"How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that  cometh  from God only?"
43,5,45,"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is  one  that accuseth you,  even  Moses, in whom ye trust."
43,5,46,"For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me."
43,5,47,"But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?"
43,6,1,"After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is  the sea  of Tiberias."
43,6,2,"And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased."
43,6,3,"And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples."
43,6,4,"And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh."
43,6,5,"When Jesus then lifted up  his  eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?"
43,6,6,"And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do."
43,6,7,"Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little."
43,6,8,"One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,"
43,6,9,"There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?"
43,6,10,"And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand."
43,6,11,"And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would."
43,6,12,"When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost."
43,6,13,"Therefore they gathered  them  together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten."
43,6,14,"Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world."
43,6,15,"When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone."
43,6,16,"And when even was  now  come, his disciples went down unto the sea,"
43,6,17,"And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them."
43,6,18,"And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew."
43,6,19,"So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid."
43,6,20,"But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid."
43,6,21,"Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went."
43,6,22,"The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but  that  his disciples were gone away alone;"
43,6,23,"(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)"
43,6,24,"When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus."
43,6,25,"And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?"
43,6,26,"Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled."
43,6,27,"Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed."
43,6,28,"Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?"
43,6,29,"Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent."
43,6,30,"They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?"
43,6,31,"Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat."
43,6,32,"Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven."
43,6,33,"For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world."
43,6,34,"Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread."
43,6,35,"And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst."
43,6,36,"But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not."
43,6,37,"All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out."
43,6,38,"For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me."
43,6,39,"And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day."
43,6,40,"And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day."
43,6,41,"The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven."
43,6,42,"And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?"
43,6,43,"Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves."
43,6,44,"No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day."
43,6,45,"It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me."
43,6,46,"Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father."
43,6,47,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life."
43,6,48,"I am that bread of life."
43,6,49,"Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead."
43,6,50,"This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die."
43,6,51,"I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
43,6,52,"The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us  his  flesh to eat?"
43,6,53,"Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you."
43,6,54,"Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."
43,6,55,"For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed."
43,6,56,"He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him."
43,6,57,"As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me."
43,6,58,"This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever."
43,6,59,"These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum."
43,6,60,"Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard  this , said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?"
43,6,61,"When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?"
43,6,62,"What  and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?"
43,6,63,"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you,  they  are spirit, and  they  are life."
43,6,64,"But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him."
43,6,65,"And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father."
43,6,66,"From that  time  many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him."
43,6,67,"Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?"
43,6,68,"Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life."
43,6,69,"And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God."
43,6,70,"Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
43,6,71,"He spake of Judas Iscariot  the son  of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve."
43,7,1,"After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him."
43,7,2,"Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand."
43,7,3,"His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest."
43,7,4,"For  there is  no man  that  doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world."
43,7,5,"For neither did his brethren believe in him."
43,7,6,"Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready."
43,7,7,"The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil."
43,7,8,"Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come."
43,7,9,"When he had said these words unto them, he abode  still  in Galilee."
43,7,10,"But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret."
43,7,11,"Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?"
43,7,12,"And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people."
43,7,13,"Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews."
43,7,14,"Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught."
43,7,15,"And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?"
43,7,16,"Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me."
43,7,17,"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or  whether  I speak of myself."
43,7,18,"He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him."
43,7,19,"Did not Moses give you the law, and  yet  none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?"
43,7,20,"The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?"
43,7,21,"Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel."
43,7,22,"Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man."
43,7,23,"If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?"
43,7,24,"Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment."
43,7,25,"Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?"
43,7,26,"But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?"
43,7,27,"Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is."
43,7,28,"Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not."
43,7,29,"But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me."
43,7,30,"Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come."
43,7,31,"And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this  man  hath done?"
43,7,32,"The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him."
43,7,33,"Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and  then  I go unto him that sent me."
43,7,34,"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find  me : and where I am,  thither  ye cannot come."
43,7,35,"Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?"
43,7,36,"What  manner of  saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find  me : and where I am,  thither  ye cannot come?"
43,7,37,"In the last day, that great  day  of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink."
43,7,38,"He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."
43,7,39,"(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet  given ; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)"
43,7,40,"Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet."
43,7,41,"Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?"
43,7,42,"Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?"
43,7,43,"So there was a division among the people because of him."
43,7,44,"And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him."
43,7,45,"Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?"
43,7,46,"The officers answered, Never man spake like this man."
43,7,47,"Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?"
43,7,48,"Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?"
43,7,49,"But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed."
43,7,50,"Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)"
43,7,51,"Doth our law judge  any  man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?"
43,7,52,"They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet."
43,7,53,"And every man went unto his own house."
43,8,1,"Jesus went unto the mount of Olives."
43,8,2,"And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them."
43,8,3,"And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,"
43,8,4,"They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act."
43,8,5,"Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?"
43,8,6,"This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with  his  finger wrote on the ground,  as though he heard them not ."
43,8,7,"So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."
43,8,8,"And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground."
43,8,9,"And they which heard  it , being convicted by  their own  conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest,  even  unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst."
43,8,10,"When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?"
43,8,11,"She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."
43,8,12,"Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
43,8,13,"The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true."
43,8,14,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself,  yet  my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go."
43,8,15,"Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man."
43,8,16,"And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me."
43,8,17,"It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true."
43,8,18,"I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me."
43,8,19,"Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also."
43,8,20,"These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come."
43,8,21,"Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come."
43,8,22,"Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come."
43,8,23,"And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world."
43,8,24,"I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am  he , ye shall die in your sins."
43,8,25,"Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even  the same  that I said unto you from the beginning."
43,8,26,"I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him."
43,8,27,"They understood not that he spake to them of the Father."
43,8,28,"Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am  he , and  that  I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things."
43,8,29,"And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him."
43,8,30,"As he spake these words, many believed on him."
43,8,31,"Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word,  then  are ye my disciples indeed;"
43,8,32,"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
43,8,33,"They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?"
43,8,34,"Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin."
43,8,35,"And the servant abideth not in the house for ever:  but  the Son abideth ever."
43,8,36,"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."
43,8,37,"I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you."
43,8,38,"I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father."
43,8,39,"They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham."
43,8,40,"But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham."
43,8,41,"Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father,  even  God."
43,8,42,"Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me."
43,8,43,"Why do ye not understand my speech?  even  because ye cannot hear my word."
43,8,44,"Ye are of  your  father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it."
43,8,45,"And because I tell  you  the truth, ye believe me not."
43,8,46,"Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?"
43,8,47,"He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear  them  not, because ye are not of God."
43,8,48,"Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?"
43,8,49,"Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me."
43,8,50,"And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth."
43,8,51,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death."
43,8,52,"Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death."
43,8,53,"Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?"
43,8,54,"Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:"
43,8,55,"Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying."
43,8,56,"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw  it , and was glad."
43,8,57,"Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?"
43,8,58,"Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am."
43,8,59,"Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by."
43,9,1,"And as  Jesus  passed by, he saw a man which was blind from  his  birth."
43,9,2,"And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?"
43,9,3,"Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him."
43,9,4,"I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work."
43,9,5,"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
43,9,6,"When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,"
43,9,7,"And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing."
43,9,8,"The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?"
43,9,9,"Some said, This is he: others  said , He is like him:  but  he said, I am  he ."
43,9,10,"Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?"
43,9,11,"He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight."
43,9,12,"Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not."
43,9,13,"They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind."
43,9,14,"And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes."
43,9,15,"Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see."
43,9,16,"Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them."
43,9,17,"They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet."
43,9,18,"But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight."
43,9,19,"And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?"
43,9,20,"His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:"
43,9,21,"But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself."
43,9,22,"These  words  spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue."
43,9,23,"Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him."
43,9,24,"Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner."
43,9,25,"He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner  or no , I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see."
43,9,26,"Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?"
43,9,27,"He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear  it  again? will ye also be his disciples?"
43,9,28,"Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples."
43,9,29,"We know that God spake unto Moses:  as for  this  fellow , we know not from whence he is."
43,9,30,"The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and  yet  he hath opened mine eyes."
43,9,31,"Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth."
43,9,32,"Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind."
43,9,33,"If this man were not of God, he could do nothing."
43,9,34,"They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out."
43,9,35,"Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?"
43,9,36,"He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?"
43,9,37,"And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee."
43,9,38,"And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him."
43,9,39,"And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind."
43,9,40,"And  some  of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?"
43,9,41,"Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth."
43,10,1,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber."
43,10,2,"But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep."
43,10,3,"To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out."
43,10,4,"And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice."
43,10,5,"And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers."
43,10,6,"This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them."
43,10,7,"Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep."
43,10,8,"All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them."
43,10,9,"I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture."
43,10,10,"The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have  it  more abundantly."
43,10,11,"I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep."
43,10,12,"But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep."
43,10,13,"The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep."
43,10,14,"I am the good shepherd, and know my  sheep , and am known of mine."
43,10,15,"As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep."
43,10,16,"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold,  and  one shepherd."
43,10,17,"Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again."
43,10,18,"No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father."
43,10,19,"There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings."
43,10,20,"And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?"
43,10,21,"Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?"
43,10,22,"And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter."
43,10,23,"And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch."
43,10,24,"Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly."
43,10,25,"Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me."
43,10,26,"But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you."
43,10,27,"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:"
43,10,28,"And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any  man  pluck them out of my hand."
43,10,29,"My Father, which gave  them  me, is greater than all; and no  man  is able to pluck  them  out of my Father’s hand."
43,10,30,"I and  my  Father are one."
43,10,31,"Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him."
43,10,32,"Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?"
43,10,33,"The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God."
43,10,34,"Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?"
43,10,35,"If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;"
43,10,36,"Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?"
43,10,37,"If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not."
43,10,38,"But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father  is  in me, and I in him."
43,10,39,"Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,"
43,10,40,"And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode."
43,10,41,"And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true."
43,10,42,"And many believed on him there."
43,11,1,"Now a certain  man  was sick,  named  Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha."
43,11,2,"(It was  that  Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)"
43,11,3,"Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick."
43,11,4,"When Jesus heard  that , he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby."
43,11,5,"Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus."
43,11,6,"When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was."
43,11,7,"Then after that saith he to  his  disciples, Let us go into Judaea again."
43,11,8,"His  disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?"
43,11,9,"Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world."
43,11,10,"But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him."
43,11,11,"These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep."
43,11,12,"Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well."
43,11,13,"Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep."
43,11,14,"Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead."
43,11,15,"And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him."
43,11,16,"Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him."
43,11,17,"Then when Jesus came, he found that he had  lain  in the grave four days already."
43,11,18,"Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:"
43,11,19,"And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother."
43,11,20,"Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat  still  in the house."
43,11,21,"Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."
43,11,22,"But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give  it  thee."
43,11,23,"Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again."
43,11,24,"Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
43,11,25,"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:"
43,11,26,"And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?"
43,11,27,"She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world."
43,11,28,"And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee."
43,11,29,"As soon as she heard  that , she arose quickly, and came unto him."
43,11,30,"Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him."
43,11,31,"The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there."
43,11,32,"Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died."
43,11,33,"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,"
43,11,34,"And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see."
43,11,35,"Jesus wept."
43,11,36,"Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!"
43,11,37,"And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"
43,11,38,"Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it."
43,11,39,"Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been  dead  four days."
43,11,40,"Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?"
43,11,41,"Then they took away the stone  from the place  where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up  his  eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me."
43,11,42,"And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said  it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me."
43,11,43,"And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth."
43,11,44,"And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go."
43,11,45,"Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him."
43,11,46,"But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done."
43,11,47,"Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles."
43,11,48,"If we let him thus alone, all  men  will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation."
43,11,49,"And one of them,  named  Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,"
43,11,50,"Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not."
43,11,51,"And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;"
43,11,52,"And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad."
43,11,53,"Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death."
43,11,54,"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples."
43,11,55,"And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves."
43,11,56,"Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?"
43,11,57,"Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew  it , that they might take him."
43,12,1,"Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead."
43,12,2,"There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him."
43,12,3,"Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment."
43,12,4,"Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s  son , which should betray him,"
43,12,5,"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?"
43,12,6,"This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein."
43,12,7,"Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this."
43,12,8,"For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always."
43,12,9,"Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead."
43,12,10,"But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;"
43,12,11,"Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus."
43,12,12,"On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,"
43,12,13,"Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed  is  the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord."
43,12,14,"And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,"
43,12,15,"Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt."
43,12,16,"These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and  that  they had done these things unto him."
43,12,17,"The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record."
43,12,18,"For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle."
43,12,19,"The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him."
43,12,20,"And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:"
43,12,21,"The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus."
43,12,22,"Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus."
43,12,23,"And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified."
43,12,24,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."
43,12,25,"He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal."
43,12,26,"If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will  my  Father honour."
43,12,27,"Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour."
43,12,28,"Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,  saying , I have both glorified  it , and will glorify  it  again."
43,12,29,"The people therefore, that stood by, and heard  it , said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him."
43,12,30,"Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes."
43,12,31,"Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out."
43,12,32,"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all  men  unto me."
43,12,33,"This he said, signifying what death he should die."
43,12,34,"The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?"
43,12,35,"Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth."
43,12,36,"While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them."
43,12,37,"But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:"
43,12,38,"That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
43,12,39,"Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,"
43,12,40,"He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with  their  eyes, nor understand with  their  heart, and be converted, and I should heal them."
43,12,41,"These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him."
43,12,42,"Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess  him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue:"
43,12,43,"For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God."
43,12,44,"Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me."
43,12,45,"And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me."
43,12,46,"I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness."
43,12,47,"And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."
43,12,48,"He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."
43,12,49,"For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak."
43,12,50,"And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak."
43,13,1,"Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end."
43,13,2,"And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s  son , to betray him;"
43,13,3,"Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;"
43,13,4,"He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself."
43,13,5,"After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe  them  with the towel wherewith he was girded."
43,13,6,"Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?"
43,13,7,"Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter."
43,13,8,"Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me."
43,13,9,"Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also  my  hands and  my  head."
43,13,10,"Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash  his  feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all."
43,13,11,"For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean."
43,13,12,"So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?"
43,13,13,"Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for  so  I am."
43,13,14,"If I then,  your  Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet."
43,13,15,"For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you."
43,13,16,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him."
43,13,17,"If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them."
43,13,18,"I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me."
43,13,19,"Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am  he ."
43,13,20,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me."
43,13,21,"When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me."
43,13,22,"Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake."
43,13,23,"Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved."
43,13,24,"Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake."
43,13,25,"He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?"
43,13,26,"Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped  it . And when he had dipped the sop, he gave  it  to Judas Iscariot,  the son  of Simon."
43,13,27,"And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly."
43,13,28,"Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him."
43,13,29,"For some  of them  thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy  those things  that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor."
43,13,30,"He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night."
43,13,31,"Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him."
43,13,32,"If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him."
43,13,33,"Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you."
43,13,34,"A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another."
43,13,35,"By this shall all  men  know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another."
43,13,36,"Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards."
43,13,37,"Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake."
43,13,38,"Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice."
43,14,1,"Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me."
43,14,2,"In my Father’s house are many mansions: if  it were  not  so , I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you."
43,14,3,"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am,  there  ye may be also."
43,14,4,"And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know."
43,14,5,"Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?"
43,14,6,"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."
43,14,7,"If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him."
43,14,8,"Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us."
43,14,9,"Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou  then , Shew us the Father?"
43,14,10,"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works."
43,14,11,"Believe me that I  am  in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake."
43,14,12,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater  works  than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father."
43,14,13,"And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
43,14,14,"If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do  it ."
43,14,15,"If ye love me, keep my commandments."
43,14,16,"And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;"
43,14,17,"Even  the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you."
43,14,18,"I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you."
43,14,19,"Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also."
43,14,20,"At that day ye shall know that I  am  in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you."
43,14,21,"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him."
43,14,22,"Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?"
43,14,23,"Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him."
43,14,24,"He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me."
43,14,25,"These things have I spoken unto you, being  yet  present with you."
43,14,26,"But the Comforter,  which is  the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."
43,14,27,"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."
43,14,28,"Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come  again  unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I."
43,14,29,"And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe."
43,14,30,"Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me."
43,14,31,"But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence."
43,15,1,"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman."
43,15,2,"Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every  branch  that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit."
43,15,3,"Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you."
43,15,4,"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me."
43,15,5,"I am the vine, ye  are  the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing."
43,15,6,"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast  them  into the fire, and they are burned."
43,15,7,"If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you."
43,15,8,"Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples."
43,15,9,"As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love."
43,15,10,"If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love."
43,15,11,"These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and  that  your joy might be full."
43,15,12,"This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you."
43,15,13,"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."
43,15,14,"Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you."
43,15,15,"Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you."
43,15,16,"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and  that  your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you."
43,15,17,"These things I command you, that ye love one another."
43,15,18,"If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before  it hated  you."
43,15,19,"If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you."
43,15,20,"Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also."
43,15,21,"But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me."
43,15,22,"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin."
43,15,23,"He that hateth me hateth my Father also."
43,15,24,"If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father."
43,15,25,"But  this cometh to pass , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause."
43,15,26,"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,  even  the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:"
43,15,27,"And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning."
43,16,1,"These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended."
43,16,2,"They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service."
43,16,3,"And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me."
43,16,4,"But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you."
43,16,5,"But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?"
43,16,6,"But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart."
43,16,7,"Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you."
43,16,8,"And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:"
43,16,9,"Of sin, because they believe not on me;"
43,16,10,"Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;"
43,16,11,"Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged."
43,16,12,"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now."
43,16,13,"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear,  that  shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come."
43,16,14,"He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew  it  unto you."
43,16,15,"All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew  it  unto you."
43,16,16,"A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father."
43,16,17,"Then said  some  of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?"
43,16,18,"They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith."
43,16,19,"Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?"
43,16,20,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy."
43,16,21,"A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world."
43,16,22,"And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you."
43,16,23,"And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give  it  you."
43,16,24,"Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full."
43,16,25,"These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father."
43,16,26,"At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:"
43,16,27,"For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God."
43,16,28,"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father."
43,16,29,"His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb."
43,16,30,"Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God."
43,16,31,"Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?"
43,16,32,"Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me."
43,16,33,"These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."
43,17,1,"These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:"
43,17,2,"As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him."
43,17,3,"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."
43,17,4,"I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do."
43,17,5,"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was."
43,17,6,"I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word."
43,17,7,"Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee."
43,17,8,"For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received  them , and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me."
43,17,9,"I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine."
43,17,10,"And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them."
43,17,11,"And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we  are ."
43,17,12,"While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled."
43,17,13,"And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves."
43,17,14,"I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
43,17,15,"I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil."
43,17,16,"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
43,17,17,"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth."
43,17,18,"As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world."
43,17,19,"And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth."
43,17,20,"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;"
43,17,21,"That they all may be one; as thou, Father,  art  in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me."
43,17,22,"And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:"
43,17,23,"I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me."
43,17,24,"Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world."
43,17,25,"O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me."
43,17,26,"And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare  it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them."
43,18,1,"When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples."
43,18,2,"And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples."
43,18,3,"Judas then, having received a band  of men  and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons."
43,18,4,"Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?"
43,18,5,"They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am  he . And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them."
43,18,6,"As soon then as he had said unto them, I am  he , they went backward, and fell to the ground."
43,18,7,"Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth."
43,18,8,"Jesus answered, I have told you that I am  he : if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:"
43,18,9,"That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none."
43,18,10,"Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus."
43,18,11,"Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"
43,18,12,"Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,"
43,18,13,"And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year."
43,18,14,"Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people."
43,18,15,"And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and  so did  another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest."
43,18,16,"But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter."
43,18,17,"Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also  one  of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not."
43,18,18,"And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself."
43,18,19,"The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine."
43,18,20,"Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing."
43,18,21,"Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said."
43,18,22,"And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?"
43,18,23,"Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?"
43,18,24,"Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest."
43,18,25,"And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also  one  of his disciples? He denied  it , and said, I am not."
43,18,26,"One of the servants of the high priest, being  his  kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?"
43,18,27,"Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew."
43,18,28,"Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover."
43,18,29,"Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?"
43,18,30,"They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee."
43,18,31,"Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:"
43,18,32,"That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die."
43,18,33,"Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?"
43,18,34,"Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?"
43,18,35,"Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?"
43,18,36,"Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence."
43,18,37,"Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice."
43,18,38,"Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault  at all ."
43,18,39,"But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"
43,18,40,"Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber."
43,19,1,"Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged  him ."
43,19,2,"And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put  it  on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,"
43,19,3,"And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands."
43,19,4,"Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him."
43,19,5,"Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And  Pilate  saith unto them, Behold the man!"
43,19,6,"When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify  him , crucify  him . Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify  him : for I find no fault in him."
43,19,7,"The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."
43,19,8,"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;"
43,19,9,"And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer."
43,19,10,"Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?"
43,19,11,"Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power  at all  against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin."
43,19,12,"And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar."
43,19,13,"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha."
43,19,14,"And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!"
43,19,15,"But they cried out, Away with  him , away with  him , crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar."
43,19,16,"Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led  him  away."
43,19,17,"And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called  the place  of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:"
43,19,18,"Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst."
43,19,19,"And Pilate wrote a title, and put  it  on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS."
43,19,20,"This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew,  and  Greek,  and  Latin."
43,19,21,"Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews."
43,19,22,"Pilate answered, What I have written I have written."
43,19,23,"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also  his  coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout."
43,19,24,"They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did."
43,19,25,"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the  wife  of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene."
43,19,26,"When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!"
43,19,27,"Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own  home ."
43,19,28,"After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst."
43,19,29,"Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put  it  upon hyssop, and put  it  to his mouth."
43,19,30,"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost."
43,19,31,"The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and  that  they might be taken away."
43,19,32,"Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him."
43,19,33,"But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:"
43,19,34,"But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water."
43,19,35,"And he that saw  it  bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe."
43,19,36,"For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken."
43,19,37,"And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced."
43,19,38,"And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave  him  leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus."
43,19,39,"And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound  weight ."
43,19,40,"Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury."
43,19,41,"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid."
43,19,42,"There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation  day ; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand."
43,20,1,"The first  day  of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre."
43,20,2,"Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him."
43,20,3,"Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre."
43,20,4,"So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre."
43,20,5,"And he stooping down,  and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in."
43,20,6,"Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,"
43,20,7,"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself."
43,20,8,"Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed."
43,20,9,"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead."
43,20,10,"Then the disciples went away again unto their own home."
43,20,11,"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down,  and looked  into the sepulchre,"
43,20,12,"And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain."
43,20,13,"And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him."
43,20,14,"And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus."
43,20,15,"Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away."
43,20,16,"Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master."
43,20,17,"Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and  to  my God, and your God."
43,20,18,"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and  that  he had spoken these things unto her."
43,20,19,"Then the same day at evening, being the first  day  of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace  be  unto you."
43,20,20,"And when he had so said, he shewed unto them  his  hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord."
43,20,21,"Then said Jesus to them again, Peace  be  unto you: as  my  Father hath sent me, even so send I you."
43,20,22,"And when he had said this, he breathed on  them , and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:"
43,20,23,"Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them;  and  whose soever  sins  ye retain, they are retained."
43,20,24,"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came."
43,20,25,"The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe."
43,20,26,"And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them:  then  came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace  be  unto you."
43,20,27,"Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust  it  into my side: and be not faithless, but believing."
43,20,28,"And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God."
43,20,29,"Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed  are  they that have not seen, and  yet  have believed."
43,20,30,"And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:"
43,20,31,"But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name."
43,21,1,"After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he  himself ."
43,21,2,"There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the  sons  of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples."
43,21,3,"Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing."
43,21,4,"But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus."
43,21,5,"Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No."
43,21,6,"And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes."
43,21,7,"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt  his  fisher’s coat  unto him , (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea."
43,21,8,"And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes."
43,21,9,"As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread."
43,21,10,"Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught."
43,21,11,"Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken."
43,21,12,"Jesus saith unto them, Come  and  dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord."
43,21,13,"Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise."
43,21,14,"This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead."
43,21,15,"So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon,  son  of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs."
43,21,16,"He saith to him again the second time, Simon,  son  of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep."
43,21,17,"He saith unto him the third time, Simon,  son  of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep."
43,21,18,"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry  thee  whither thou wouldest not."
43,21,19,"This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me."
43,21,20,"Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?"
43,21,21,"Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what  shall  this man  do ?"
43,21,22,"Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what  is that  to thee? follow thou me."
43,21,23,"Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what  is that  to thee?"
43,21,24,"This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true."
43,21,25,"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen."
44,1,1,"The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,"
44,1,2,"Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:"
44,1,3,"To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:"
44,1,4,"And, being assembled together with  them , commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which,  saith he , ye have heard of me."
44,1,5,"For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence."
44,1,6,"When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?"
44,1,7,"And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power."
44,1,8,"But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."
44,1,9,"And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight."
44,1,10,"And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;"
44,1,11,"Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven."
44,1,12,"Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey."
44,1,13,"And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James  the son  of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas  the brother  of James."
44,1,14,"These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren."
44,1,15,"And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)"
44,1,16,"Men  and  brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus."
44,1,17,"For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry."
44,1,18,"Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out."
44,1,19,"And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood."
44,1,20,"For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take."
44,1,21,"Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,"
44,1,22,"Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection."
44,1,23,"And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias."
44,1,24,"And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all  men , shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,"
44,1,25,"That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place."
44,1,26,"And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles."
44,2,1,"And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place."
44,2,2,"And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting."
44,2,3,"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them."
44,2,4,"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance."
44,2,5,"And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven."
44,2,6,"Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language."
44,2,7,"And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?"
44,2,8,"And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?"
44,2,9,"Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,"
44,2,10,"Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,"
44,2,11,"Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God."
44,2,12,"And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?"
44,2,13,"Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine."
44,2,14,"But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all  ye  that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:"
44,2,15,"For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is  but  the third hour of the day."
44,2,16,"But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;"
44,2,17,"And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:"
44,2,18,"And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:"
44,2,19,"And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:"
44,2,20,"The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:"
44,2,21,"And it shall come to pass,  that  whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
44,2,22,"Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:"
44,2,23,"Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:"
44,2,24,"Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it."
44,2,25,"For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:"
44,2,26,"Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:"
44,2,27,"Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."
44,2,28,"Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance."
44,2,29,"Men  and  brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day."
44,2,30,"Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;"
44,2,31,"He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption."
44,2,32,"This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses."
44,2,33,"Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear."
44,2,34,"For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,"
44,2,35,"Until I make thy foes thy footstool."
44,2,36,"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ."
44,2,37,"Now when they heard  this , they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men  and  brethren, what shall we do?"
44,2,38,"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
44,2,39,"For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off,  even  as many as the Lord our God shall call."
44,2,40,"And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation."
44,2,41,"Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added  unto them  about three thousand souls."
44,2,42,"And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers."
44,2,43,"And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles."
44,2,44,"And all that believed were together, and had all things common;"
44,2,45,"And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all  men , as every man had need."
44,2,46,"And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,"
44,2,47,"Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved."
44,3,1,"Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer,  being  the ninth  hour ."
44,3,2,"And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;"
44,3,3,"Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms."
44,3,4,"And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us."
44,3,5,"And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them."
44,3,6,"Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk."
44,3,7,"And he took him by the right hand, and lifted  him  up: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength."
44,3,8,"And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God."
44,3,9,"And all the people saw him walking and praising God:"
44,3,10,"And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him."
44,3,11,"And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering."
44,3,12,"And when Peter saw  it , he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?"
44,3,13,"The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let  him  go."
44,3,14,"But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;"
44,3,15,"And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses."
44,3,16,"And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all."
44,3,17,"And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did  it , as  did  also your rulers."
44,3,18,"But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled."
44,3,19,"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;"
44,3,20,"And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:"
44,3,21,"Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began."
44,3,22,"For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you."
44,3,23,"And it shall come to pass,  that  every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people."
44,3,24,"Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days."
44,3,25,"Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed."
44,3,26,"Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities."
44,4,1,"And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,"
44,4,2,"Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead."
44,4,3,"And they laid hands on them, and put  them  in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide."
44,4,4,"Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand."
44,4,5,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,"
44,4,6,"And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem."
44,4,7,"And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?"
44,4,8,"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,"
44,4,9,"If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;"
44,4,10,"Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead,  even  by him doth this man stand here before you whole."
44,4,11,"This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner."
44,4,12,"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."
44,4,13,"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus."
44,4,14,"And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it."
44,4,15,"But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,"
44,4,16,"Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them  is  manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny  it ."
44,4,17,"But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name."
44,4,18,"And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus."
44,4,19,"But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye."
44,4,20,"For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."
44,4,21,"So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all  men  glorified God for that which was done."
44,4,22,"For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed."
44,4,23,"And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them."
44,4,24,"And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou  art  God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:"
44,4,25,"Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?"
44,4,26,"The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ."
44,4,27,"For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,"
44,4,28,"For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done."
44,4,29,"And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,"
44,4,30,"By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus."
44,4,31,"And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness."
44,4,32,"And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any  of them  that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common."
44,4,33,"And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all."
44,4,34,"Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,"
44,4,35,"And laid  them  down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need."
44,4,36,"And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite,  and  of the country of Cyprus,"
44,4,37,"Having land, sold  it , and brought the money, and laid  it  at the apostles’ feet."
44,5,1,"But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,"
44,5,2,"And kept back  part  of the price, his wife also being privy  to it , and brought a certain part, and laid  it  at the apostles’ feet."
44,5,3,"But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back  part  of the price of the land?"
44,5,4,"Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God."
44,5,5,"And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things."
44,5,6,"And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried  him  out, and buried  him ."
44,5,7,"And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in."
44,5,8,"And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much."
44,5,9,"Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband  are  at the door, and shall carry thee out."
44,5,10,"Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying  her  forth, buried  her  by her husband."
44,5,11,"And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things."
44,5,12,"And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch."
44,5,13,"And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them."
44,5,14,"And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)"
44,5,15,"Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid  them  on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them."
44,5,16,"There came also a multitude  out  of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one."
44,5,17,"Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,"
44,5,18,"And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison."
44,5,19,"But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,"
44,5,20,"Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
44,5,21,"And when they heard  that , they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought."
44,5,22,"But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,"
44,5,23,"Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within."
44,5,24,"Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow."
44,5,25,"Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people."
44,5,26,"Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned."
44,5,27,"And when they had brought them, they set  them  before the council: and the high priest asked them,"
44,5,28,"Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us."
44,5,29,"Then Peter and the  other  apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men."
44,5,30,"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree."
44,5,31,"Him hath God exalted with his right hand  to be  a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins."
44,5,32,"And we are his witnesses of these things; and  so is  also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him."
44,5,33,"When they heard  that , they were cut  to the heart , and took counsel to slay them."
44,5,34,"Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;"
44,5,35,"And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men."
44,5,36,"For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought."
44,5,37,"After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all,  even  as many as obeyed him, were dispersed."
44,5,38,"And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:"
44,5,39,"But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God."
44,5,40,"And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten  them , they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go."
44,5,41,"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name."
44,5,42,"And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ."
44,6,1,"And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration."
44,6,2,"Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples  unto them , and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables."
44,6,3,"Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business."
44,6,4,"But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word."
44,6,5,"And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:"
44,6,6,"Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid  their  hands on them."
44,6,7,"And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith."
44,6,8,"And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people."
44,6,9,"Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called  the synagogue  of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen."
44,6,10,"And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake."
44,6,11,"Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and  against  God."
44,6,12,"And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon  him , and caught him, and brought  him  to the council,"
44,6,13,"And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:"
44,6,14,"For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us."
44,6,15,"And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel."
44,7,1,"Then said the high priest, Are these things so?"
44,7,2,"And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,"
44,7,3,"And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee."
44,7,4,"Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell."
44,7,5,"And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not  so much as  to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when  as yet  he had no child."
44,7,6,"And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat  them  evil four hundred years."
44,7,7,"And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place."
44,7,8,"And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so  Abraham  begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac  begat  Jacob; and Jacob  begat  the twelve patriarchs."
44,7,9,"And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,"
44,7,10,"And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house."
44,7,11,"Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance."
44,7,12,"But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first."
44,7,13,"And at the second  time  Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh."
44,7,14,"Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to  him , and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls."
44,7,15,"So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,"
44,7,16,"And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor  the father  of Sychem."
44,7,17,"But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,"
44,7,18,"Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph."
44,7,19,"The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live."
44,7,20,"In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father’s house three months:"
44,7,21,"And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son."
44,7,22,"And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds."
44,7,23,"And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel."
44,7,24,"And seeing one  of them  suffer wrong, he defended  him , and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:"
44,7,25,"For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not."
44,7,26,"And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?"
44,7,27,"But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?"
44,7,28,"Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?"
44,7,29,"Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons."
44,7,30,"And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush."
44,7,31,"When Moses saw  it , he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold  it , the voice of the Lord came unto him,"
44,7,32,"Saying , I  am  the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold."
44,7,33,"Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground."
44,7,34,"I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt."
44,7,35,"This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send  to be  a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush."
44,7,36,"He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years."
44,7,37,"This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear."
44,7,38,"This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and  with  our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:"
44,7,39,"To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust  him  from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,"
44,7,40,"Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for  as for  this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him."
44,7,41,"And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands."
44,7,42,"Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices  by the space of  forty years in the wilderness?"
44,7,43,"Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon."
44,7,44,"Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen."
44,7,45,"Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;"
44,7,46,"Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob."
44,7,47,"But Solomon built him an house."
44,7,48,"Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,"
44,7,49,"Heaven  is  my throne, and earth  is  my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what  is  the place of my rest?"
44,7,50,"Hath not my hand made all these things?"
44,7,51,"Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers  did , so  do  ye."
44,7,52,"Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:"
44,7,53,"Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept  it ."
44,7,54,"When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with  their  teeth."
44,7,55,"But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,"
44,7,56,"And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God."
44,7,57,"Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,"
44,7,58,"And cast  him  out of the city, and stoned  him : and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul."
44,7,59,"And they stoned Stephen, calling upon  God , and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
44,7,60,"And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep."
44,8,1,"And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles."
44,8,2,"And devout men carried Stephen  to his burial , and made great lamentation over him."
44,8,3,"As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed  them  to prison."
44,8,4,"Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word."
44,8,5,"Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them."
44,8,6,"And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did."
44,8,7,"For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed  with them : and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed."
44,8,8,"And there was great joy in that city."
44,8,9,"But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:"
44,8,10,"To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God."
44,8,11,"And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries."
44,8,12,"But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."
44,8,13,"Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done."
44,8,14,"Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:"
44,8,15,"Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:"
44,8,16,"(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)"
44,8,17,"Then laid they  their  hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost."
44,8,18,"And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,"
44,8,19,"Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost."
44,8,20,"But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money."
44,8,21,"Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God."
44,8,22,"Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee."
44,8,23,"For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and  in  the bond of iniquity."
44,8,24,"Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me."
44,8,25,"And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans."
44,8,26,"And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert."
44,8,27,"And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,"
44,8,28,"Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet."
44,8,29,"Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot."
44,8,30,"And Philip ran thither to  him , and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?"
44,8,31,"And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him."
44,8,32,"The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:"
44,8,33,"In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth."
44,8,34,"And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?"
44,8,35,"Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus."
44,8,36,"And as they went on  their  way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See,  here is  water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?"
44,8,37,"And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
44,8,38,"And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him."
44,8,39,"And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing."
44,8,40,"But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea."
44,9,1,"And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,"
44,9,2,"And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem."
44,9,3,"And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:"
44,9,4,"And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
44,9,5,"And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:  it is  hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
44,9,6,"And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord  said  unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do."
44,9,7,"And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man."
44,9,8,"And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought  him  into Damascus."
44,9,9,"And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink."
44,9,10,"And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I  am here , Lord."
44,9,11,"And the Lord  said  unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for  one  called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,"
44,9,12,"And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting  his  hand on him, that he might receive his sight."
44,9,13,"Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:"
44,9,14,"And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name."
44,9,15,"But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:"
44,9,16,"For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake."
44,9,17,"And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord,  even  Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost."
44,9,18,"And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized."
44,9,19,"And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus."
44,9,20,"And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God."
44,9,21,"But all that heard  him  were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?"
44,9,22,"But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ."
44,9,23,"And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:"
44,9,24,"But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him."
44,9,25,"Then the disciples took him by night, and let  him  down by the wall in a basket."
44,9,26,"And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple."
44,9,27,"But Barnabas took him, and brought  him  to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus."
44,9,28,"And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem."
44,9,29,"And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him."
44,9,30,"Which  when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus."
44,9,31,"Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied."
44,9,32,"And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all  quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda."
44,9,33,"And there he found a certain man named AEneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy."
44,9,34,"And Peter said unto him, AEneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately."
44,9,35,"And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord."
44,9,36,"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did."
44,9,37,"And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid  her  in an upper chamber."
44,9,38,"And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring  him  that he would not delay to come to them."
44,9,39,"Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them."
44,9,40,"But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning  him  to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up."
44,9,41,"And he gave her  his  hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive."
44,9,42,"And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord."
44,9,43,"And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner."
44,10,1,"There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian  band ,"
44,10,2,"A  devout  man , and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway."
44,10,3,"He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius."
44,10,4,"And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God."
44,10,5,"And now send men to Joppa, and call for  one  Simon, whose surname is Peter:"
44,10,6,"He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do."
44,10,7,"And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;"
44,10,8,"And when he had declared all  these  things unto them, he sent them to Joppa."
44,10,9,"On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:"
44,10,10,"And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,"
44,10,11,"And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:"
44,10,12,"Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air."
44,10,13,"And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat."
44,10,14,"But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean."
44,10,15,"And the voice  spake  unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed,  that  call not thou common."
44,10,16,"This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven."
44,10,17,"Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,"
44,10,18,"And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there."
44,10,19,"While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee."
44,10,20,"Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them."
44,10,21,"Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what  is  the cause wherefore ye are come?"
44,10,22,"And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee."
44,10,23,"Then called he them in, and lodged  them . And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him."
44,10,24,"And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends."
44,10,25,"And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped  him ."
44,10,26,"But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man."
44,10,27,"And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together."
44,10,28,"And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean."
44,10,29,"Therefore came I  unto you  without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?"
44,10,30,"And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,"
44,10,31,"And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God."
44,10,32,"Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of  one  Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee."
44,10,33,"Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God."
44,10,34,"Then Peter opened  his  mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:"
44,10,35,"But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him."
44,10,36,"The word which  God  sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)"
44,10,37,"That word,  I say , ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;"
44,10,38,"How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him."
44,10,39,"And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:"
44,10,40,"Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;"
44,10,41,"Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God,  even  to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead."
44,10,42,"And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God  to be  the Judge of quick and dead."
44,10,43,"To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins."
44,10,44,"While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word."
44,10,45,"And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost."
44,10,46,"For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,"
44,10,47,"Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?"
44,10,48,"And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days."
44,11,1,"And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God."
44,11,2,"And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,"
44,11,3,"Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them."
44,11,4,"But Peter rehearsed  the matter  from the beginning, and expounded  it  by order unto them, saying,"
44,11,5,"I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:"
44,11,6,"Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air."
44,11,7,"And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat."
44,11,8,"But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth."
44,11,9,"But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed,  that  call not thou common."
44,11,10,"And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven."
44,11,11,"And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me."
44,11,12,"And the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:"
44,11,13,"And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;"
44,11,14,"Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved."
44,11,15,"And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning."
44,11,16,"Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost."
44,11,17,"Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as  he did  unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?"
44,11,18,"When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life."
44,11,19,"Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only."
44,11,20,"And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus."
44,11,21,"And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord."
44,11,22,"Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch."
44,11,23,"Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord."
44,11,24,"For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord."
44,11,25,"Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:"
44,11,26,"And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch."
44,11,27,"And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch."
44,11,28,"And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar."
44,11,29,"Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:"
44,11,30,"Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul."
44,12,1,"Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth  his  hands to vex certain of the church."
44,12,2,"And he killed James the brother of John with the sword."
44,12,3,"And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)"
44,12,4,"And when he had apprehended him, he put  him  in prison, and delivered  him  to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people."
44,12,5,"Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him."
44,12,6,"And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison."
44,12,7,"And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon  him , and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from  his  hands."
44,12,8,"And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me."
44,12,9,"And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision."
44,12,10,"When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him."
44,12,11,"And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and  from  all the expectation of the people of the Jews."
44,12,12,"And when he had considered  the thing , he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying."
44,12,13,"And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda."
44,12,14,"And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate."
44,12,15,"And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel."
44,12,16,"But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened  the door , and saw him, they were astonished."
44,12,17,"But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place."
44,12,18,"Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter."
44,12,19,"And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that  they  should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and  there  abode."
44,12,20,"And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s  country ."
44,12,21,"And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them."
44,12,22,"And the people gave a shout,  saying, It is  the voice of a god, and not of a man."
44,12,23,"And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost."
44,12,24,"But the word of God grew and multiplied."
44,12,25,"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled  their  ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark."
44,13,1,"Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."
44,13,2,"As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them."
44,13,3,"And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid  their  hands on them, they sent  them  away."
44,13,4,"So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus."
44,13,5,"And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to  their  minister."
44,13,6,"And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name  was  Barjesus:"
44,13,7,"Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God."
44,13,8,"But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith."
44,13,9,"Then Saul, (who also  is called  Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,"
44,13,10,"And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief,  thou  child of the devil,  thou  enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?"
44,13,11,"And now, behold, the hand of the Lord  is  upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand."
44,13,12,"Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord."
44,13,13,"Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem."
44,13,14,"But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down."
44,13,15,"And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying,  Ye  men  and  brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on."
44,13,16,"Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with  his  hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience."
44,13,17,"The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it."
44,13,18,"And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness."
44,13,19,"And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot."
44,13,20,"And after that he gave  unto them  judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet."
44,13,21,"And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years."
44,13,22,"And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the  son  of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will."
44,13,23,"Of this man’s seed hath God according to  his  promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:"
44,13,24,"When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel."
44,13,25,"And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not  he . But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of  his  feet I am not worthy to loose."
44,13,26,"Men  and  brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent."
44,13,27,"For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled  them  in condemning  him ."
44,13,28,"And though they found no cause of death  in him , yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain."
44,13,29,"And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took  him  down from the tree, and laid  him  in a sepulchre."
44,13,30,"But God raised him from the dead:"
44,13,31,"And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people."
44,13,32,"And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,"
44,13,33,"God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee."
44,13,34,"And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead,  now  no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David."
44,13,35,"Wherefore he saith also in another  psalm , Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."
44,13,36,"For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:"
44,13,37,"But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption."
44,13,38,"Be it known unto you therefore, men  and  brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:"
44,13,39,"And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses."
44,13,40,"Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;"
44,13,41,"Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you."
44,13,42,"And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath."
44,13,43,"Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God."
44,13,44,"And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God."
44,13,45,"But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming."
44,13,46,"Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles."
44,13,47,"For so hath the Lord commanded us,  saying , I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth."
44,13,48,"And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed."
44,13,49,"And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region."
44,13,50,"But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts."
44,13,51,"But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium."
44,13,52,"And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost."
44,14,1,"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed."
44,14,2,"But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren."
44,14,3,"Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands."
44,14,4,"But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles."
44,14,5,"And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use  them  despitefully, and to stone them,"
44,14,6,"They were ware of  it , and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:"
44,14,7,"And there they preached the gospel."
44,14,8,"And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked:"
44,14,9,"The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,"
44,14,10,"Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked."
44,14,11,"And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men."
44,14,12,"And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker."
44,14,13,"Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people."
44,14,14,"Which  when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard  of , they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,"
44,14,15,"And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:"
44,14,16,"Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways."
44,14,17,"Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
44,14,18,"And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them."
44,14,19,"And there came thither  certain  Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew  him  out of the city, supposing he had been dead."
44,14,20,"Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe."
44,14,21,"And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and  to  Iconium, and Antioch,"
44,14,22,"Confirming the souls of the disciples,  and  exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."
44,14,23,"And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed."
44,14,24,"And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia."
44,14,25,"And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:"
44,14,26,"And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled."
44,14,27,"And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles."
44,14,28,"And there they abode long time with the disciples."
44,15,1,"And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren,  and said , Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved."
44,15,2,"When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question."
44,15,3,"And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren."
44,15,4,"And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and  of  the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them."
44,15,5,"But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command  them  to keep the law of Moses."
44,15,6,"And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter."
44,15,7,"And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men  and  brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe."
44,15,8,"And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as  he did  unto us;"
44,15,9,"And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith."
44,15,10,"Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
44,15,11,"But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they."
44,15,12,"Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them."
44,15,13,"And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men  and  brethren, hearken unto me:"
44,15,14,"Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name."
44,15,15,"And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,"
44,15,16,"After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:"
44,15,17,"That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things."
44,15,18,"Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world."
44,15,19,"Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:"
44,15,20,"But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and  from  fornication, and  from  things strangled, and  from  blood."
44,15,21,"For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day."
44,15,22,"Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas;  namely , Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:"
44,15,23,"And they wrote  letters  by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren  send  greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:"
44,15,24,"Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying,  Ye must  be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no  such  commandment:"
44,15,25,"It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"
44,15,26,"Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,15,27,"We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell  you  the same things by mouth."
44,15,28,"For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;"
44,15,29,"That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well."
44,15,30,"So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:"
44,15,31,"Which  when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation."
44,15,32,"And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed  them ."
44,15,33,"And after they had tarried  there  a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles."
44,15,34,"Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still."
44,15,35,"Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also."
44,15,36,"And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord,  and see  how they do."
44,15,37,"And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark."
44,15,38,"But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work."
44,15,39,"And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;"
44,15,40,"And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God."
44,15,41,"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches."
44,16,1,"Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father  was  a Greek:"
44,16,2,"Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium."
44,16,3,"Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek."
44,16,4,"And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem."
44,16,5,"And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily."
44,16,6,"Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,"
44,16,7,"After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not."
44,16,8,"And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas."
44,16,9,"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us."
44,16,10,"And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them."
44,16,11,"Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next  day  to Neapolis;"
44,16,12,"And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia,  and  a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days."
44,16,13,"And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted  thither ."
44,16,14,"And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard  us : whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul."
44,16,15,"And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought  us , saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide  there . And she constrained us."
44,16,16,"And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:"
44,16,17,"The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation."
44,16,18,"And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour."
44,16,19,"And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew  them  into the marketplace unto the rulers,"
44,16,20,"And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,"
44,16,21,"And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans."
44,16,22,"And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat  them ."
44,16,23,"And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast  them  into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:"
44,16,24,"Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks."
44,16,25,"And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them."
44,16,26,"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed."
44,16,27,"And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled."
44,16,28,"But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here."
44,16,29,"Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,"
44,16,30,"And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44,16,31,"And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house."
44,16,32,"And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house."
44,16,33,"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed  their  stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway."
44,16,34,"And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house."
44,16,35,"And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go."
44,16,36,"And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace."
44,16,37,"But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast  us  into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out."
44,16,38,"And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans."
44,16,39,"And they came and besought them, and brought  them  out, and desired  them  to depart out of the city."
44,16,40,"And they went out of the prison, and entered into  the house of  Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed."
44,17,1,"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:"
44,17,2,"And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,"
44,17,3,"Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ."
44,17,4,"And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few."
44,17,5,"But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people."
44,17,6,"And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;"
44,17,7,"Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king,  one  Jesus."
44,17,8,"And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things."
44,17,9,"And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go."
44,17,10,"And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming  thither  went into the synagogue of the Jews."
44,17,11,"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."
44,17,12,"Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few."
44,17,13,"But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people."
44,17,14,"And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still."
44,17,15,"And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed."
44,17,16,"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry."
44,17,17,"Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him."
44,17,18,"Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection."
44,17,19,"And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest,  is ?"
44,17,20,"For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean."
44,17,21,"(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)"
44,17,22,"Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said,  Ye  men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious."
44,17,23,"For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."
44,17,24,"God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;"
44,17,25,"Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;"
44,17,26,"And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;"
44,17,27,"That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:"
44,17,28,"For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring."
44,17,29,"Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device."
44,17,30,"And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:"
44,17,31,"Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by  that  man whom he hath ordained;  whereof  he hath given assurance unto all  men , in that he hath raised him from the dead."
44,17,32,"And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this  matter ."
44,17,33,"So Paul departed from among them."
44,17,34,"Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which  was  Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them."
44,18,1,"After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;"
44,18,2,"And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them."
44,18,3,"And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers."
44,18,4,"And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks."
44,18,5,"And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews  that  Jesus  was  Christ."
44,18,6,"And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook  his  raiment, and said unto them, Your blood  be  upon your own heads; I  am  clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles."
44,18,7,"And he departed thence, and entered into a certain  man’s  house, named Justus,  one  that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue."
44,18,8,"And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized."
44,18,9,"Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:"
44,18,10,"For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city."
44,18,11,"And he continued  there  a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."
44,18,12,"And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,"
44,18,13,"Saying, This  fellow  persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law."
44,18,14,"And when Paul was now about to open  his  mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O  ye  Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:"
44,18,15,"But if it be a question of words and names, and  of  your law, look ye  to it ; for I will be no judge of such  matters ."
44,18,16,"And he drave them from the judgment seat."
44,18,17,"Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat  him  before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things."
44,18,18,"And Paul  after this  tarried  there  yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn  his  head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow."
44,18,19,"And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews."
44,18,20,"When they desired  him  to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;"
44,18,21,"But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus."
44,18,22,"And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch."
44,18,23,"And after he had spent some time  there , he departed, and went over  all  the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples."
44,18,24,"And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man,  and  mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus."
44,18,25,"This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John."
44,18,26,"And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto  them , and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly."
44,18,27,"And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:"
44,18,28,"For he mightily convinced the Jews,  and that  publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ."
44,19,1,"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,"
44,19,2,"He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost."
44,19,3,"And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism."
44,19,4,"Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus."
44,19,5,"When they heard  this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,19,6,"And when Paul had laid  his  hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied."
44,19,7,"And all the men were about twelve."
44,19,8,"And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God."
44,19,9,"But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus."
44,19,10,"And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks."
44,19,11,"And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:"
44,19,12,"So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them."
44,19,13,"Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth."
44,19,14,"And there were seven sons of  one  Sceva, a Jew,  and  chief of the priests, which did so."
44,19,15,"And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?"
44,19,16,"And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
44,19,17,"And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified."
44,19,18,"And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds."
44,19,19,"Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all  men : and they counted the price of them, and found  it  fifty thousand  pieces  of silver."
44,19,20,"So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed."
44,19,21,"After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
44,19,22,"So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season."
44,19,23,"And the same time there arose no small stir about that way."
44,19,24,"For a certain  man  named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;"
44,19,25,"Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth."
44,19,26,"Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:"
44,19,27,"So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth."
44,19,28,"And when they heard  these sayings , they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great  is  Diana of the Ephesians."
44,19,29,"And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre."
44,19,30,"And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not."
44,19,31,"And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring  him  that he would not adventure himself into the theatre."
44,19,32,"Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together."
44,19,33,"And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people."
44,19,34,"But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great  is  Diana of the Ephesians."
44,19,35,"And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said,  Ye  men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the  image  which fell down from Jupiter?"
44,19,36,"Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly."
44,19,37,"For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess."
44,19,38,"Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another."
44,19,39,"But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly."
44,19,40,"For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse."
44,19,41,"And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly."
44,20,1,"And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto  him  the disciples, and embraced  them , and departed for to go into Macedonia."
44,20,2,"And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,"
44,20,3,"And  there  abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia."
44,20,4,"And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus."
44,20,5,"These going before tarried for us at Troas."
44,20,6,"And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days."
44,20,7,"And upon the first  day  of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight."
44,20,8,"And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together."
44,20,9,"And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead."
44,20,10,"And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing  him  said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him."
44,20,11,"When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed."
44,20,12,"And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted."
44,20,13,"And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot."
44,20,14,"And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene."
44,20,15,"And we sailed thence, and came the next  day  over against Chios; and the next  day  we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next  day  we came to Miletus."
44,20,16,"For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost."
44,20,17,"And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church."
44,20,18,"And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,"
44,20,19,"Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:"
44,20,20,"And  how I kept back nothing that was profitable  unto you , but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,"
44,20,21,"Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,20,22,"And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:"
44,20,23,"Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me."
44,20,24,"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God."
44,20,25,"And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more."
44,20,26,"Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I  am  pure from the blood of all  men ."
44,20,27,"For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God."
44,20,28,"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood."
44,20,29,"For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock."
44,20,30,"Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them."
44,20,31,"Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears."
44,20,32,"And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified."
44,20,33,"I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel."
44,20,34,"Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me."
44,20,35,"I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive."
44,20,36,"And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all."
44,20,37,"And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,"
44,20,38,"Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship."
44,21,1,"And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the  day  following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:"
44,21,2,"And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth."
44,21,3,"Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden."
44,21,4,"And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,5,"And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till  we were  out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed."
44,21,6,"And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again."
44,21,7,"And when we had finished  our  course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day."
44,21,8,"And the next  day  we that were of Paul’s company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was  one  of the seven; and abode with him."
44,21,9,"And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy."
44,21,10,"And as we tarried  there  many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus."
44,21,11,"And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver  him  into the hands of the Gentiles."
44,21,12,"And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,13,"Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,21,14,"And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done."
44,21,15,"And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem."
44,21,16,"There went with us also  certain  of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge."
44,21,17,"And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly."
44,21,18,"And the  day  following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present."
44,21,19,"And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry."
44,21,20,"And when they heard  it , they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:"
44,21,21,"And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise  their  children, neither to walk after the customs."
44,21,22,"What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come."
44,21,23,"Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;"
44,21,24,"Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave  their  heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but  that  thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law."
44,21,25,"As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written  and  concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from  things  offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication."
44,21,26,"Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them."
44,21,27,"And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,"
44,21,28,"Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all  men  every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place."
44,21,29,"(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)"
44,21,30,"And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut."
44,21,31,"And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar."
44,21,32,"Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul."
44,21,33,"Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded  him  to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done."
44,21,34,"And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle."
44,21,35,"And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people."
44,21,36,"For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him."
44,21,37,"And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?"
44,21,38,"Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?"
44,21,39,"But Paul said, I am a man  which am  a Jew of Tarsus,  a city  in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people."
44,21,40,"And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto  them  in the Hebrew tongue, saying,"
44,22,1,"Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence  which I make  now unto you."
44,22,2,"(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)"
44,22,3,"I am verily a man  which am  a Jew, born in Tarsus,  a city  in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel,  and  taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day."
44,22,4,"And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women."
44,22,5,"As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished."
44,22,6,"And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me."
44,22,7,"And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
44,22,8,"And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest."
44,22,9,"And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me."
44,22,10,"And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do."
44,22,11,"And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus."
44,22,12,"And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt  there ,"
44,22,13,"Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him."
44,22,14,"And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth."
44,22,15,"For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard."
44,22,16,"And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord."
44,22,17,"And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;"
44,22,18,"And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me."
44,22,19,"And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:"
44,22,20,"And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him."
44,22,21,"And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles."
44,22,22,"And they gave him audience unto this word, and  then  lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a  fellow  from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live."
44,22,23,"And as they cried out, and cast off  their  clothes, and threw dust into the air,"
44,22,24,"The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him."
44,22,25,"And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?"
44,22,26,"When the centurion heard  that , he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman."
44,22,27,"Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea."
44,22,28,"And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was  free  born."
44,22,29,"Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him."
44,22,30,"On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from  his  bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them."
44,23,1,"And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men  and  brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day."
44,23,2,"And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth."
44,23,3,"Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee,  thou  whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?"
44,23,4,"And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?"
44,23,5,"Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people."
44,23,6,"But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men  and  brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question."
44,23,7,"And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided."
44,23,8,"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both."
44,23,9,"And there arose a great cry: and the scribes  that were  of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God."
44,23,10,"And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring  him  into the castle."
44,23,11,"And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome."
44,23,12,"And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul."
44,23,13,"And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy."
44,23,14,"And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul."
44,23,15,"Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him."
44,23,16,"And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul."
44,23,17,"Then Paul called one of the centurions unto  him , and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him."
44,23,18,"So he took him, and brought  him  to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto  him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee."
44,23,19,"Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went  with him  aside privately, and asked  him , What is that thou hast to tell me?"
44,23,20,"And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly."
44,23,21,"But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee."
44,23,22,"So the chief captain  then  let the young man depart, and charged  him, See thou  tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me."
44,23,23,"And he called unto  him  two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;"
44,23,24,"And provide  them  beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring  him  safe unto Felix the governor."
44,23,25,"And he wrote a letter after this manner:"
44,23,26,"Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix  sendeth  greeting."
44,23,27,"This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman."
44,23,28,"And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:"
44,23,29,"Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds."
44,23,30,"And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what  they had  against him. Farewell."
44,23,31,"Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought  him  by night to Antipatris."
44,23,32,"On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:"
44,23,33,"Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him."
44,23,34,"And when the governor had read  the letter , he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that  he was  of Cilicia;"
44,23,35,"I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall."
44,24,1,"And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and  with  a certain orator  named  Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul."
44,24,2,"And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse  him , saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,"
44,24,3,"We accept  it  always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness."
44,24,4,"Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words."
44,24,5,"For we have found this man  a  pestilent  fellow , and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:"
44,24,6,"Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law."
44,24,7,"But the chief captain Lysias came  upon us , and with great violence took  him  away out of our hands,"
44,24,8,"Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him."
44,24,9,"And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so."
44,24,10,"Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:"
44,24,11,"Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship."
44,24,12,"And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:"
44,24,13,"Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me."
44,24,14,"But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:"
44,24,15,"And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."
44,24,16,"And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and  toward  men."
44,24,17,"Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings."
44,24,18,"Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult."
44,24,19,"Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me."
44,24,20,"Or else let these same  here  say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,"
44,24,21,"Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day."
44,24,22,"And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of  that  way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter."
44,24,23,"And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let  him  have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him."
44,24,24,"And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ."
44,24,25,"And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee."
44,24,26,"He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him."
44,24,27,"But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound."
44,25,1,"Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem."
44,25,2,"Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,"
44,25,3,"And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him."
44,25,4,"But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly  thither ."
44,25,5,"Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with  me , and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him."
44,25,6,"And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought."
44,25,7,"And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove."
44,25,8,"While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all."
44,25,9,"But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?"
44,25,10,"Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest."
44,25,11,"For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar."
44,25,12,"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go."
44,25,13,"And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus."
44,25,14,"And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:"
44,25,15,"About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed  me , desiring  to have  judgment against him."
44,25,16,"To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him."
44,25,17,"Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth."
44,25,18,"Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:"
44,25,19,"But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive."
44,25,20,"And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked  him  whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters."
44,25,21,"But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar."
44,25,22,"Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him."
44,25,23,"And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth."
44,25,24,"And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and  also  here, crying that he ought not to live any longer."
44,25,25,"But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him."
44,25,26,"Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write."
44,25,27,"For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes  laid  against him."
44,26,1,"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:"
44,26,2,"I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:"
44,26,3,"Especially  because I know  thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently."
44,26,4,"My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;"
44,26,5,"Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee."
44,26,6,"And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:"
44,26,7,"Unto which  promise  our twelve tribes, instantly serving  God  day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews."
44,26,8,"Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?"
44,26,9,"I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
44,26,10,"Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against  them ."
44,26,11,"And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled  them  to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted  them  even unto strange cities."
44,26,12,"Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,"
44,26,13,"At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me."
44,26,14,"And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?  it is  hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
44,26,15,"And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest."
44,26,16,"But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;"
44,26,17,"Delivering thee from the people, and  from  the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,"
44,26,18,"To open their eyes,  and  to turn  them  from darkness to light, and  from  the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me."
44,26,19,"Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:"
44,26,20,"But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and  then  to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance."
44,26,21,"For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill  me ."
44,26,22,"Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:"
44,26,23,"That Christ should suffer,  and  that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles."
44,26,24,"And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad."
44,26,25,"But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness."
44,26,26,"For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner."
44,26,27,"King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest."
44,26,28,"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."
44,26,29,"And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds."
44,26,30,"And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:"
44,26,31,"And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
44,26,32,"Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar."
44,27,1,"And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto  one  named Julius, a centurion of Augustus’ band."
44,27,2,"And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia;  one  Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us."
44,27,3,"And the next  day  we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave  him  liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself."
44,27,4,"And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary."
44,27,5,"And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra,  a city  of Lycia."
44,27,6,"And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein."
44,27,7,"And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;"
44,27,8,"And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city  of  Lasea."
44,27,9,"Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished  them ,"
44,27,10,"And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives."
44,27,11,"Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul."
44,27,12,"And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice,  and there  to winter;  which is  an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west."
44,27,13,"And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained  their  purpose, loosing  thence , they sailed close by Crete."
44,27,14,"But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon."
44,27,15,"And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let  her  drive."
44,27,16,"And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:"
44,27,17,"Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven."
44,27,18,"And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next  day  they lightened the ship;"
44,27,19,"And the third  day  we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship."
44,27,20,"And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on  us , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away."
44,27,21,"But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss."
44,27,22,"And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of  any man’s  life among you, but of the ship."
44,27,23,"For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,"
44,27,24,"Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee."
44,27,25,"Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me."
44,27,26,"Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island."
44,27,27,"But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;"
44,27,28,"And sounded, and found  it  twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found  it  fifteen fathoms."
44,27,29,"Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day."
44,27,30,"And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,"
44,27,31,"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved."
44,27,32,"Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off."
44,27,33,"And while the day was coming on, Paul besought  them  all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing."
44,27,34,"Wherefore I pray you to take  some  meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you."
44,27,35,"And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken  it , he began to eat."
44,27,36,"Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took  some  meat."
44,27,37,"And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls."
44,27,38,"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea."
44,27,39,"And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship."
44,27,40,"And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed  themselves  unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore."
44,27,41,"And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves."
44,27,42,"And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape."
44,27,43,"But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from  their  purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast  themselves  first  into the sea , and get to land:"
44,27,44,"And the rest, some on boards, and some on  broken pieces  of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land."
44,28,1,"And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita."
44,28,2,"And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold."
44,28,3,"And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid  them  on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand."
44,28,4,"And when the barbarians saw the  venomous  beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live."
44,28,5,"And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm."
44,28,6,"Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god."
44,28,7,"In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously."
44,28,8,"And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him."
44,28,9,"So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:"
44,28,10,"Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded  us  with such things as were necessary."
44,28,11,"And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux."
44,28,12,"And landing at Syracuse, we tarried  there  three days."
44,28,13,"And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:"
44,28,14,"Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome."
44,28,15,"And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage."
44,28,16,"And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him."
44,28,17,"And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men  and  brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
44,28,18,"Who, when they had examined me, would have let  me  go, because there was no cause of death in me."
44,28,19,"But when the Jews spake against  it , I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of."
44,28,20,"For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see  you , and to speak with  you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."
44,28,21,"And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee."
44,28,22,"But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against."
44,28,23,"And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into  his  lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and  out of  the prophets, from morning till evening."
44,28,24,"And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not."
44,28,25,"And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,"
44,28,26,"Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:"
44,28,27,"For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with  their  eyes, and hear with  their  ears, and understand with  their  heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."
44,28,28,"Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and  that  they will hear it."
44,28,29,"And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves."
44,28,30,"And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,"
44,28,31,"Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him."
45,1,1,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called  to be  an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,"
45,1,2,"(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)"
45,1,3,"Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;"
45,1,4,"And declared  to be  the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:"
45,1,5,"By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:"
45,1,6,"Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:"
45,1,7,"To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called  to be  saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
45,1,8,"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world."
45,1,9,"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;"
45,1,10,"Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you."
45,1,11,"For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;"
45,1,12,"That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me."
45,1,13,"Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles."
45,1,14,"I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise."
45,1,15,"So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also."
45,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."
45,1,17,"For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith."
45,1,18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;"
45,1,19,"Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed  it  unto them."
45,1,20,"For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,  even  his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:"
45,1,21,"Because that, when they knew God, they glorified  him  not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."
45,1,22,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,"
45,1,23,"And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things."
45,1,24,"Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:"
45,1,25,"Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen."
45,1,26,"For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:"
45,1,27,"And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet."
45,1,28,"And even as they did not like to retain God in  their  knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;"
45,1,29,"Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,"
45,1,30,"Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
45,1,31,"Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:"
45,1,32,"Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."
45,2,1,"Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things."
45,2,2,"But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things."
45,2,3,"And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?"
45,2,4,"Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?"
45,2,5,"But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;"
45,2,6,"Who will render to every man according to his deeds:"
45,2,7,"To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:"
45,2,8,"But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,"
45,2,9,"Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;"
45,2,10,"But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:"
45,2,11,"For there is no respect of persons with God."
45,2,12,"For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;"
45,2,13,"(For not the hearers of the law  are  just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified."
45,2,14,"For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:"
45,2,15,"Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and  their  thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)"
45,2,16,"In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel."
45,2,17,"Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,"
45,2,18,"And knowest  his  will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;"
45,2,19,"And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,"
45,2,20,"An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law."
45,2,21,"Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?"
45,2,22,"Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?"
45,2,23,"Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?"
45,2,24,"For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written."
45,2,25,"For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision."
45,2,26,"Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?"
45,2,27,"And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?"
45,2,28,"For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither  is that  circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:"
45,2,29,"But he  is  a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision  is that  of the heart, in the spirit,  and  not in the letter; whose praise  is  not of men, but of God."
45,3,1,"What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit  is there  of circumcision?"
45,3,2,"Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God."
45,3,3,"For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?"
45,3,4,"God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged."
45,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say?  Is  God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)"
45,3,6,"God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?"
45,3,7,"For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?"
45,3,8,"And not  rather , (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just."
45,3,9,"What then? are we better  than they ? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;"
45,3,10,"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"
45,3,11,"There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God."
45,3,12,"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one."
45,3,13,"Their throat  is  an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps  is  under their lips:"
45,3,14,"Whose mouth  is  full of cursing and bitterness:"
45,3,15,"Their feet  are  swift to shed blood:"
45,3,16,"Destruction and misery  are  in their ways:"
45,3,17,"And the way of peace have they not known:"
45,3,18,"There is no fear of God before their eyes."
45,3,19,"Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God."
45,3,20,"Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law  is  the knowledge of sin."
45,3,21,"But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;"
45,3,22,"Even the righteousness of God  which is  by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:"
45,3,23,"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"
45,3,24,"Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:"
45,3,25,"Whom God hath set forth  to be  a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;"
45,3,26,"To declare,  I say , at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus."
45,3,27,"Where  is  boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith."
45,3,28,"Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law."
45,3,29,"Is he  the God of the Jews only?  is he  not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:"
45,3,30,"Seeing  it is  one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith."
45,3,31,"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."
45,4,1,"What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?"
45,4,2,"For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath  whereof  to glory; but not before God."
45,4,3,"For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness."
45,4,4,"Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt."
45,4,5,"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."
45,4,6,"Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,"
45,4,7,"Saying , Blessed  are  they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered."
45,4,8,"Blessed  is  the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin."
45,4,9,"Cometh  this blessedness then upon the circumcision  only , or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness."
45,4,10,"How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision."
45,4,11,"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which  he had yet  being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:"
45,4,12,"And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which  he had  being  yet  uncircumcised."
45,4,13,"For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world,  was  not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."
45,4,14,"For if they which are of the law  be  heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:"
45,4,15,"Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is,  there is  no transgression."
45,4,16,"Therefore  it is  of faith, that  it might be  by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,"
45,4,17,"(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed,  even  God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were."
45,4,18,"Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be."
45,4,19,"And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara’s womb:"
45,4,20,"He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;"
45,4,21,"And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform."
45,4,22,"And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness."
45,4,23,"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;"
45,4,24,"But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;"
45,4,25,"Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification."
45,5,1,"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:"
45,5,2,"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
45,5,3,"And not only  so , but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;"
45,5,4,"And patience, experience; and experience, hope:"
45,5,5,"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."
45,5,6,"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly."
45,5,7,"For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die."
45,5,8,"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
45,5,9,"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."
45,5,10,"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life."
45,5,11,"And not only  so , but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement."
45,5,12,"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:"
45,5,13,"(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law."
45,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come."
45,5,15,"But not as the offence, so also  is  the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace,  which is  by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many."
45,5,16,"And not as  it was  by one that sinned,  so is  the gift: for the judgment  was  by one to condemnation, but the free gift  is  of many offences unto justification."
45,5,17,"For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)"
45,5,18,"Therefore as by the offence of one  judgment came  upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one  the free gift came  upon all men unto justification of life."
45,5,19,"For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."
45,5,20,"Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:"
45,5,21,"That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
45,6,2,"God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"
45,6,3,"Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?"
45,6,4,"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
45,6,5,"For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also  in the likeness  of  his  resurrection:"
45,6,6,"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with  him , that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin."
45,6,7,"For he that is dead is freed from sin."
45,6,8,"Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:"
45,6,9,"Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him."
45,6,10,"For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God."
45,6,11,"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,12,"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof."
45,6,13,"Neither yield ye your members  as  instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members  as  instruments of righteousness unto God."
45,6,14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace."
45,6,15,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."
45,6,16,"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?"
45,6,17,"But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you."
45,6,18,"Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness."
45,6,19,"I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness."
45,6,20,"For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness."
45,6,21,"What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things  is  death."
45,6,22,"But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life."
45,6,23,"For the wages of sin  is  death; but the gift of God  is  eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,7,1,"Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?"
45,7,2,"For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to  her  husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of  her  husband."
45,7,3,"So then if, while  her  husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man."
45,7,4,"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another,  even  to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God."
45,7,5,"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death."
45,7,6,"But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not  in  the oldness of the letter."
45,7,7,"What shall we say then?  Is  the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet."
45,7,8,"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin  was  dead."
45,7,9,"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."
45,7,10,"And the commandment, which  was ordained  to life, I found  to be  unto death."
45,7,11,"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew  me ."
45,7,12,"Wherefore the law  is  holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."
45,7,13,"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful."
45,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."
45,7,15,"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I."
45,7,16,"If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that  it is  good."
45,7,17,"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
45,7,18,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but  how  to perform that which is good I find not."
45,7,19,"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do."
45,7,20,"Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me."
45,7,21,"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me."
45,7,22,"For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:"
45,7,23,"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
45,7,24,"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
45,7,25,"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin."
45,8,1,"There is  therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
45,8,2,"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death."
45,8,3,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:"
45,8,4,"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
45,8,5,"For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit."
45,8,6,"For to be carnally minded  is  death; but to be spiritually minded  is  life and peace."
45,8,7,"Because the carnal mind  is  enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
45,8,8,"So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God."
45,8,9,"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
45,8,10,"And if Christ  be  in you, the body  is  dead because of sin; but the Spirit  is  life because of righteousness."
45,8,11,"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you."
45,8,12,"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh."
45,8,13,"For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live."
45,8,14,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
45,8,15,"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father."
45,8,16,"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:"
45,8,17,"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with  him , that we may be also glorified together."
45,8,18,"For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time  are  not worthy  to be compared  with the glory which shall be revealed in us."
45,8,19,"For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God."
45,8,20,"For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected  the same  in hope,"
45,8,21,"Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God."
45,8,22,"For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now."
45,8,23,"And not only  they , but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption,  to wit , the redemption of our body."
45,8,24,"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?"
45,8,25,"But if we hope for that we see not,  then  do we with patience wait for  it ."
45,8,26,"Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
45,8,27,"And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what  is  the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to  the will of  God."
45,8,28,"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to  his  purpose."
45,8,29,"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate  to be  conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren."
45,8,30,"Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
45,8,31,"What shall we then say to these things? If God  be  for us, who  can be  against us?"
45,8,32,"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
45,8,33,"Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect?  It is  God that justifieth."
45,8,34,"Who  is  he that condemneth?  It is  Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us."
45,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?  shall  tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
45,8,36,"As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
45,8,37,"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."
45,8,38,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,"
45,8,39,"Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,9,1,"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,"
45,9,2,"That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart."
45,9,3,"For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:"
45,9,4,"Who are Israelites; to whom  pertaineth  the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service  of God , and the promises;"
45,9,5,"Whose  are  the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ  came , who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen."
45,9,6,"Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they  are  not all Israel, which are of Israel:"
45,9,7,"Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham,  are they  all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called."
45,9,8,"That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these  are  not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed."
45,9,9,"For this  is  the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son."
45,9,10,"And not only  this ; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,  even  by our father Isaac;"
45,9,11,"(For  the children  being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)"
45,9,12,"It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger."
45,9,13,"As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated."
45,9,14,"What shall we say then?  Is there  unrighteousness with God? God forbid."
45,9,15,"For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
45,9,16,"So then  it is  not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy."
45,9,17,"For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth."
45,9,18,"Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will  have mercy , and whom he will he hardeneth."
45,9,19,"Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?"
45,9,20,"Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed  it , Why hast thou made me thus?"
45,9,21,"Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"
45,9,22,"What  if God, willing to shew  his  wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:"
45,9,23,"And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,"
45,9,24,"Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?"
45,9,25,"As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved."
45,9,26,"And it shall come to pass,  that  in the place where it was said unto them, Ye  are  not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God."
45,9,27,"Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:"
45,9,28,"For he will finish the work, and cut  it  short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth."
45,9,29,"And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha."
45,9,30,"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith."
45,9,31,"But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness."
45,9,32,"Wherefore? Because  they sought it  not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;"
45,9,33,"As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
45,10,1,"Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved."
45,10,2,"For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge."
45,10,3,"For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."
45,10,4,"For Christ  is  the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."
45,10,5,"For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them."
45,10,6,"But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down  from above :)"
45,10,7,"Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)"
45,10,8,"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee,  even  in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;"
45,10,9,"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."
45,10,10,"For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
45,10,11,"For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
45,10,12,"For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him."
45,10,13,"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
45,10,14,"How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?"
45,10,15,"And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!"
45,10,16,"But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?"
45,10,17,"So then faith  cometh  by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."
45,10,18,"But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world."
45,10,19,"But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by  them that are  no people,  and  by a foolish nation I will anger you."
45,10,20,"But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me."
45,10,21,"But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people."
45,11,1,"I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham,  of  the tribe of Benjamin."
45,11,2,"God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,"
45,11,3,"Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."
45,11,4,"But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to  the image of  Baal."
45,11,5,"Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace."
45,11,6,"And if by grace, then  is it  no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if  it be  of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work."
45,11,7,"What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded"
45,11,8,"(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day."
45,11,9,"And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:"
45,11,10,"Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway."
45,11,11,"I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but  rather  through their fall salvation  is come  unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy."
45,11,12,"Now if the fall of them  be  the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?"
45,11,13,"For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:"
45,11,14,"If by any means I may provoke to emulation  them which are  my flesh, and might save some of them."
45,11,15,"For if the casting away of them  be  the reconciling of the world, what  shall  the receiving  of them be , but life from the dead?"
45,11,16,"For if the firstfruit  be  holy, the lump  is  also  holy : and if the root  be  holy, so  are  the branches."
45,11,17,"And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;"
45,11,18,"Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee."
45,11,19,"Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in."
45,11,20,"Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:"
45,11,21,"For if God spared not the natural branches,  take heed  lest he also spare not thee."
45,11,22,"Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in  his  goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off."
45,11,23,"And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again."
45,11,24,"For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural  branches , be graffed into their own olive tree?"
45,11,25,"For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in."
45,11,26,"And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:"
45,11,27,"For this  is  my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins."
45,11,28,"As concerning the gospel,  they are  enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election,  they are  beloved for the fathers’ sakes."
45,11,29,"For the gifts and calling of God  are  without repentance."
45,11,30,"For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:"
45,11,31,"Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy."
45,11,32,"For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all."
45,11,33,"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable  are  his judgments, and his ways past finding out!"
45,11,34,"For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counseller?"
45,11,35,"Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?"
45,11,36,"For of him, and through him, and to him,  are  all things: to whom  be  glory for ever. Amen."
45,12,1,"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,  which is  your reasonable service."
45,12,2,"And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what  is  that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."
45,12,3,"For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think  of himself  more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith."
45,12,4,"For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:"
45,12,5,"So we,  being  many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another."
45,12,6,"Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy,  let us prophesy  according to the proportion of faith;"
45,12,7,"Or ministry,  let us wait  on  our  ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;"
45,12,8,"Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth,  let him do it  with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness."
45,12,9,"Let  love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good."
45,12,10,"Be  kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;"
45,12,11,"Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;"
45,12,12,"Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;"
45,12,13,"Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality."
45,12,14,"Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not."
45,12,15,"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."
45,12,16,"Be  of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits."
45,12,17,"Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men."
45,12,18,"If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men."
45,12,19,"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but  rather  give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance  is  mine; I will repay, saith the Lord."
45,12,20,"Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head."
45,12,21,"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."
45,13,1,"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."
45,13,2,"Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation."
45,13,3,"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:"
45,13,4,"For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to  execute  wrath upon him that doeth evil."
45,13,5,"Wherefore  ye  must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake."
45,13,6,"For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing."
45,13,7,"Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute  is due ; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour."
45,13,8,"Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law."
45,13,9,"For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if  there be  any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
45,13,10,"Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love  is  the fulfilling of the law."
45,13,11,"And that, knowing the time, that now  it is  high time to awake out of sleep: for now  is  our salvation nearer than when we believed."
45,13,12,"The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."
45,13,13,"Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying."
45,13,14,"But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to  fulfil  the lusts  thereof ."
45,14,1,"Him that is weak in the faith receive ye,  but  not to doubtful disputations."
45,14,2,"For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs."
45,14,3,"Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him."
45,14,4,"Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand."
45,14,5,"One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day  alike . Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind."
45,14,6,"He that regardeth the day, regardeth  it  unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard  it . He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks."
45,14,7,"For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself."
45,14,8,"For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s."
45,14,9,"For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living."
45,14,10,"But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ."
45,14,11,"For it is written,  As  I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God."
45,14,12,"So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God."
45,14,13,"Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in  his  brother’s way."
45,14,14,"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that  there is  nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him  it is  unclean."
45,14,15,"But if thy brother be grieved with  thy  meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died."
45,14,16,"Let not then your good be evil spoken of:"
45,14,17,"For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."
45,14,18,"For he that in these things serveth Christ  is  acceptable to God, and approved of men."
45,14,19,"Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another."
45,14,20,"For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed  are  pure; but  it is  evil for that man who eateth with offence."
45,14,21,"It is  good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor  any thing  whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak."
45,14,22,"Hast thou faith? have  it  to thyself before God. Happy  is  he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth."
45,14,23,"And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because  he eateth  not of faith: for whatsoever  is  not of faith is sin."
45,15,1,"We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves."
45,15,2,"Let every one of us please  his  neighbour for  his  good to edification."
45,15,3,"For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me."
45,15,4,"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope."
45,15,5,"Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:"
45,15,6,"That ye may with one mind  and  one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
45,15,7,"Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God."
45,15,8,"Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises  made  unto the fathers:"
45,15,9,"And that the Gentiles might glorify God for  his  mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name."
45,15,10,"And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people."
45,15,11,"And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people."
45,15,12,"And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust."
45,15,13,"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost."
45,15,14,"And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another."
45,15,15,"Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,"
45,15,16,"That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost."
45,15,17,"I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God."
45,15,18,"For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,"
45,15,19,"Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ."
45,15,20,"Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:"
45,15,21,"But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand."
45,15,22,"For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you."
45,15,23,"But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;"
45,15,24,"Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your  company ."
45,15,25,"But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints."
45,15,26,"For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem."
45,15,27,"It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things."
45,15,28,"When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain."
45,15,29,"And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ."
45,15,30,"Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in  your  prayers to God for me;"
45,15,31,"That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which  I have  for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;"
45,15,32,"That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed."
45,15,33,"Now the God of peace  be  with you all. Amen."
45,16,1,"I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:"
45,16,2,"That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also."
45,16,3,"Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:"
45,16,4,"Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles."
45,16,5,"Likewise  greet  the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ."
45,16,6,"Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us."
45,16,7,"Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me."
45,16,8,"Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord."
45,16,9,"Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved."
45,16,10,"Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus’  household ."
45,16,11,"Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the  household  of Narcissus, which are in the Lord."
45,16,12,"Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord."
45,16,13,"Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine."
45,16,14,"Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them."
45,16,15,"Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them."
45,16,16,"Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you."
45,16,17,"Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them."
45,16,18,"For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple."
45,16,19,"For your obedience is come abroad unto all  men . I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil."
45,16,20,"And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ  be  with you. Amen."
45,16,21,"Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you."
45,16,22,"I Tertius, who wrote  this  epistle, salute you in the Lord."
45,16,23,"Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother."
45,16,24,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ  be  with you all. Amen."
45,16,25,"Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,"
45,16,26,"But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:"
45,16,27,"To God only wise,  be  glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.   Written to the Romans from Corinthus,  and sent  by Phebe servant of the church at Cenchrea."
46,1,1,"Paul, called  to be  an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes  our  brother,"
46,1,2,"Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called  to be  saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:"
46,1,3,"Grace  be  unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and  from  the Lord Jesus Christ."
46,1,4,"I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;"
46,1,5,"That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and  in  all knowledge;"
46,1,6,"Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:"
46,1,7,"So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
46,1,8,"Who shall also confirm you unto the end,  that ye may be  blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
46,1,9,"God  is  faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord."
46,1,10,"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and  that  there be no divisions among you; but  that  ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
46,1,11,"For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them  which are of the house  of Chloe, that there are contentions among you."
46,1,12,"Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ."
46,1,13,"Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"
46,1,14,"I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;"
46,1,15,"Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name."
46,1,16,"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other."
46,1,17,"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect."
46,1,18,"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God."
46,1,19,"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
46,1,20,"Where  is  the wise? where  is  the scribe? where  is  the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?"
46,1,21,"For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
46,1,22,"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:"
46,1,23,"But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;"
46,1,24,"But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
46,1,25,"Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
46,1,26,"For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble,  are called :"
46,1,27,"But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;"
46,1,28,"And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen,  yea , and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:"
46,1,29,"That no flesh should glory in his presence."
46,1,30,"But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:"
46,1,31,"That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
46,2,1,"And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God."
46,2,2,"For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
46,2,3,"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."
46,2,4,"And my speech and my preaching  was  not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:"
46,2,5,"That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
46,2,6,"Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:"
46,2,7,"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,  even  the hidden  wisdom , which God ordained before the world unto our glory:"
46,2,8,"Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known  it , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
46,2,9,"But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."
46,2,10,"But God hath revealed  them  unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
46,2,11,"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God."
46,2,12,"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God."
46,2,13,"Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
46,2,14,"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know  them , because they are spiritually discerned."
46,2,15,"But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man."
46,2,16,"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."
46,3,1,"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal,  even  as unto babes in Christ."
46,3,2,"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able  to bear it , neither yet now are ye able."
46,3,3,"For ye are yet carnal: for whereas  there is  among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?"
46,3,4,"For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I  am  of Apollos; are ye not carnal?"
46,3,5,"Who then is Paul, and who  is  Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?"
46,3,6,"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase."
46,3,7,"So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase."
46,3,8,"Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour."
46,3,9,"For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry,  ye are  God’s building."
46,3,10,"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon."
46,3,11,"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
46,3,12,"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;"
46,3,13,"Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is."
46,3,14,"If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward."
46,3,15,"If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire."
46,3,16,"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and  that  the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"
46,3,17,"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which  temple  ye are."
46,3,18,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
46,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness."
46,3,20,"And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
46,3,21,"Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;"
46,3,22,"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;"
46,3,23,"And ye are Christ’s; and Christ  is  God’s."
46,4,1,"Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God."
46,4,2,"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."
46,4,3,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self."
46,4,4,"For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord."
46,4,5,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God."
46,4,6,"And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and  to  Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think  of men  above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another."
46,4,7,"For who maketh thee to differ  from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive  it , why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received  it ?"
46,4,8,"Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you."
46,4,9,"For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men."
46,4,10,"We  are  fools for Christ’s sake, but ye  are  wise in Christ; we  are  weak, but ye  are  strong; ye  are  honourable, but we  are  despised."
46,4,11,"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;"
46,4,12,"And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:"
46,4,13,"Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world,  and are  the offscouring of all things unto this day."
46,4,14,"I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn  you ."
46,4,15,"For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet  have ye  not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."
46,4,16,"Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me."
46,4,17,"For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church."
46,4,18,"Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you."
46,4,19,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power."
46,4,20,"For the kingdom of God  is  not in word, but in power."
46,4,21,"What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and  in  the spirit of meekness?"
46,5,1,"It is reported commonly  that there is  fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife."
46,5,2,"And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you."
46,5,3,"For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present,  concerning  him that hath so done this deed,"
46,5,4,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
46,5,5,"To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
46,5,6,"Your glorying  is  not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?"
46,5,7,"Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:"
46,5,8,"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened  bread  of sincerity and truth."
46,5,9,"I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:"
46,5,10,"Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world."
46,5,11,"But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat."
46,5,12,"For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?"
46,5,13,"But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person."
46,6,1,"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?"
46,6,2,"Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
46,6,3,"Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?"
46,6,4,"If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church."
46,6,5,"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?"
46,6,6,"But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers."
46,6,7,"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather  suffer yourselves to  be defrauded?"
46,6,8,"Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that  your  brethren."
46,6,9,"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,"
46,6,10,"Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."
46,6,11,"And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."
46,6,12,"All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."
46,6,13,"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body  is  not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body."
46,6,14,"And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power."
46,6,15,"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make  them  the members of an harlot? God forbid."
46,6,16,"What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh."
46,6,17,"But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."
46,6,18,"Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body."
46,6,19,"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost  which is  in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?"
46,6,20,"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s."
46,7,1,"Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me:  It is  good for a man not to touch a woman."
46,7,2,"Nevertheless,  to avoid  fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."
46,7,3,"Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband."
46,7,4,"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife."
46,7,5,"Defraud ye not one the other, except  it be  with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency."
46,7,6,"But I speak this by permission,  and  not of commandment."
46,7,7,"For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that."
46,7,8,"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I."
46,7,9,"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."
46,7,10,"And unto the married I command,  yet  not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from  her  husband:"
46,7,11,"But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to  her  husband: and let not the husband put away  his  wife."
46,7,12,"But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away."
46,7,13,"And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him."
46,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy."
46,7,15,"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such  cases : but God hath called us to peace."
46,7,16,"For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save  thy  husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save  thy  wife?"
46,7,17,"But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches."
46,7,18,"Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised."
46,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."
46,7,20,"Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called."
46,7,21,"Art thou called  being  a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use  it  rather."
46,7,22,"For he that is called in the Lord,  being  a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called,  being  free, is Christ’s servant."
46,7,23,"Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men."
46,7,24,"Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God."
46,7,25,"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful."
46,7,26,"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress,  I say , that  it is  good for a man so to be."
46,7,27,"Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife."
46,7,28,"But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you."
46,7,29,"But this I say, brethren, the time  is  short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;"
46,7,30,"And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;"
46,7,31,"And they that use this world, as not abusing  it : for the fashion of this world passeth away."
46,7,32,"But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:"
46,7,33,"But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please  his  wife."
46,7,34,"There is difference  also  between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please  her  husband."
46,7,35,"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction."
46,7,36,"But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of  her  age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry."
46,7,37,"Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well."
46,7,38,"So then he that giveth  her  in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth  her  not in marriage doeth better."
46,7,39,"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord."
46,7,40,"But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God."
46,8,1,"Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth."
46,8,2,"And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know."
46,8,3,"But if any man love God, the same is known of him."
46,8,4,"As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol  is  nothing in the world, and that  there is  none other God but one."
46,8,5,"For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)"
46,8,6,"But to us  there is but  one God, the Father, of whom  are  all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom  are  all things, and we by him."
46,8,7,"Howbeit  there is  not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat  it  as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled."
46,8,8,"But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse."
46,8,9,"But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak."
46,8,10,"For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;"
46,8,11,"And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
46,8,12,"But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ."
46,8,13,"Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend."
46,9,1,"Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?"
46,9,2,"If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord."
46,9,3,"Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,"
46,9,4,"Have we not power to eat and to drink?"
46,9,5,"Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and  as  the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?"
46,9,6,"Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?"
46,9,7,"Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"
46,9,8,"Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?"
46,9,9,"For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?"
46,9,10,"Or saith he  it  altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt,  this  is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope."
46,9,11,"If we have sown unto you spiritual things,  is it  a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?"
46,9,12,"If others be partakers of  this  power over you,  are  not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ."
46,9,13,"Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live  of the things  of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?"
46,9,14,"Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel."
46,9,15,"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for  it were  better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void."
46,9,16,"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!"
46,9,17,"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation  of the gospel  is committed unto me."
46,9,18,"What is my reward then?  Verily  that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel."
46,9,19,"For though I be free from all  men , yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more."
46,9,20,"And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;"
46,9,21,"To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law."
46,9,22,"To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all  men , that I might by all means save some."
46,9,23,"And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with  you ."
46,9,24,"Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain."
46,9,25,"And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they  do it  to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible."
46,9,26,"I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:"
46,9,27,"But I keep under my body, and bring  it  into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."
46,10,1,"Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"
46,10,2,"And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;"
46,10,3,"And did all eat the same spiritual meat;"
46,10,4,"And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ."
46,10,5,"But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness."
46,10,6,"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted."
46,10,7,"Neither be ye idolaters, as  were  some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
46,10,8,"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand."
46,10,9,"Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents."
46,10,10,"Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer."
46,10,11,"Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come."
46,10,12,"Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall."
46,10,13,"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God  is  faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear  it ."
46,10,14,"Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry."
46,10,15,"I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say."
46,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
46,10,17,"For we  being  many are one bread,  and  one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread."
46,10,18,"Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?"
46,10,19,"What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?"
46,10,20,"But  I say , that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils."
46,10,21,"Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils."
46,10,22,"Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?"
46,10,23,"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not."
46,10,24,"Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s  wealth ."
46,10,25,"Whatsoever is sold in the shambles,  that  eat, asking no question for conscience sake:"
46,10,26,"For the earth  is  the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof."
46,10,27,"If any of them that believe not bid you  to a feast , and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake."
46,10,28,"But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth  is  the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof:"
46,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another  man’s  conscience?"
46,10,30,"For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
46,10,31,"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."
46,10,32,"Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:"
46,10,33,"Even as I please all  men  in all  things , not seeking mine own profit, but the  profit  of many, that they may be saved."
46,11,1,"Be ye followers of me, even as I also  am  of Christ."
46,11,2,"Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered  them  to you."
46,11,3,"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman  is  the man; and the head of Christ  is  God."
46,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having  his  head covered, dishonoureth his head."
46,11,5,"But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with  her  head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven."
46,11,6,"For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered."
46,11,7,"For a man indeed ought not to cover  his  head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man."
46,11,8,"For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man."
46,11,9,"Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man."
46,11,10,"For this cause ought the woman to have power on  her  head because of the angels."
46,11,11,"Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord."
46,11,12,"For as the woman  is  of the man, even so  is  the man also by the woman; but all things of God."
46,11,13,"Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?"
46,11,14,"Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?"
46,11,15,"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for  her  hair is given her for a covering."
46,11,16,"But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God."
46,11,17,"Now in this that I declare  unto you  I praise  you  not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse."
46,11,18,"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it."
46,11,19,"For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you."
46,11,20,"When ye come together therefore into one place,  this  is not to eat the Lord’s supper."
46,11,21,"For in eating every one taketh before  other  his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken."
46,11,22,"What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise  you  not."
46,11,23,"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the  same  night in which he was betrayed took bread:"
46,11,24,"And when he had given thanks, he brake  it , and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me."
46,11,25,"After the same manner also  he took  the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink  it , in remembrance of me."
46,11,26,"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come."
46,11,27,"Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink  this  cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."
46,11,28,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of  that  bread, and drink of  that  cup."
46,11,29,"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body."
46,11,30,"For this cause many  are  weak and sickly among you, and many sleep."
46,11,31,"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
46,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world."
46,11,33,"Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another."
46,11,34,"And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come."
46,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual  gifts , brethren, I would not have you ignorant."
46,12,2,"Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led."
46,12,3,"Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and  that  no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."
46,12,4,"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."
46,12,5,"And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord."
46,12,6,"And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all."
46,12,7,"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal."
46,12,8,"For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;"
46,12,9,"To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;"
46,12,10,"To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another  divers  kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:"
46,12,11,"But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will."
46,12,12,"For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also  is  Christ."
46,12,13,"For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether  we be  Jews or Gentiles, whether  we be  bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."
46,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
46,12,15,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
46,12,16,"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
46,12,17,"If the whole body  were  an eye, where  were  the hearing? If the whole  were  hearing, where  were  the smelling?"
46,12,18,"But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him."
46,12,19,"And if they were all one member, where  were  the body?"
46,12,20,"But now  are they  many members, yet but one body."
46,12,21,"And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
46,12,22,"Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:"
46,12,23,"And those  members  of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely  parts  have more abundant comeliness."
46,12,24,"For our comely  parts  have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that  part  which lacked:"
46,12,25,"That there should be no schism in the body; but  that  the members should have the same care one for another."
46,12,26,"And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it."
46,12,27,"Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
46,12,28,"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues."
46,12,29,"Are  all apostles?  are  all prophets?  are  all teachers?  are  all workers of miracles?"
46,12,30,"Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?"
46,12,31,"But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way."
46,13,1,"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become  as  sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."
46,13,2,"And though I have  the gift of  prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing."
46,13,3,"And though I bestow all my goods to feed  the poor , and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing."
46,13,4,"Charity suffereth long,  and  is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,"
46,13,5,"Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;"
46,13,6,"Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;"
46,13,7,"Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."
46,13,8,"Charity never faileth: but whether  there be  prophecies, they shall fail; whether  there be  tongues, they shall cease; whether  there be  knowledge, it shall vanish away."
46,13,9,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part."
46,13,10,"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."
46,13,11,"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."
46,13,12,"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."
46,13,13,"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these  is  charity."
46,14,1,"Follow after charity, and desire spiritual  gifts , but rather that ye may prophesy."
46,14,2,"For he that speaketh in an  unknown  tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth  him ; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries."
46,14,3,"But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men  to  edification, and exhortation, and comfort."
46,14,4,"He that speaketh in an  unknown  tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church."
46,14,5,"I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater  is  he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying."
46,14,6,"Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?"
46,14,7,"And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?"
46,14,8,"For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?"
46,14,9,"So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air."
46,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them  is  without signification."
46,14,11,"Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh  shall be  a barbarian unto me."
46,14,12,"Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual  gifts , seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church."
46,14,13,"Wherefore let him that speaketh in an  unknown  tongue pray that he may interpret."
46,14,14,"For if I pray in an  unknown  tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful."
46,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."
46,14,16,"Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?"
46,14,17,"For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified."
46,14,18,"I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:"
46,14,19,"Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that  by my voice  I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an  unknown  tongue."
46,14,20,"Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men."
46,14,21,"In the law it is written, With  men of  other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord."
46,14,22,"Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying  serveth  not for them that believe not, but for them which believe."
46,14,23,"If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in  those that are  unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?"
46,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or  one  unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:"
46,14,25,"And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on  his  face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth."
46,14,26,"How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying."
46,14,27,"If any man speak in an  unknown  tongue,  let it be  by two, or at the most  by  three, and  that  by course; and let one interpret."
46,14,28,"But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God."
46,14,29,"Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge."
46,14,30,"If  any thing  be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace."
46,14,31,"For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted."
46,14,32,"And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets."
46,14,33,"For God is not  the author  of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints."
46,14,34,"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but  they are commanded  to be under obedience, as also saith the law."
46,14,35,"And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."
46,14,36,"What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?"
46,14,37,"If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord."
46,14,38,"But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant."
46,14,39,"Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues."
46,14,40,"Let all things be done decently and in order."
46,15,1,"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;"
46,15,2,"By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain."
46,15,3,"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;"
46,15,4,"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:"
46,15,5,"And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:"
46,15,6,"After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep."
46,15,7,"After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles."
46,15,8,"And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time."
46,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
46,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which  was bestowed  upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
46,15,11,"Therefore whether  it were  I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed."
46,15,12,"Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
46,15,13,"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:"
46,15,14,"And if Christ be not risen, then  is  our preaching vain, and your faith  is  also vain."
46,15,15,"Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not."
46,15,16,"For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:"
46,15,17,"And if Christ be not raised, your faith  is  vain; ye are yet in your sins."
46,15,18,"Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished."
46,15,19,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable."
46,15,20,"But now is Christ risen from the dead,  and  become the firstfruits of them that slept."
46,15,21,"For since by man  came  death, by man  came  also the resurrection of the dead."
46,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
46,15,23,"But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming."
46,15,24,"Then  cometh  the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power."
46,15,25,"For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet."
46,15,26,"The last enemy  that  shall be destroyed  is  death."
46,15,27,"For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under  him, it is  manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him."
46,15,28,"And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."
46,15,29,"Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?"
46,15,30,"And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?"
46,15,31,"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
46,15,32,"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die."
46,15,33,"Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners."
46,15,34,"Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak  this  to your shame."
46,15,35,"But some  man  will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?"
46,15,36,"Thou  fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:"
46,15,37,"And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other  grain :"
46,15,38,"But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body."
46,15,39,"All flesh  is  not the same flesh: but  there is  one  kind of  flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes,  and  another of birds."
46,15,40,"There are  also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial  is  one, and the  glory  of the terrestrial  is  another."
46,15,41,"There is  one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for  one  star differeth from  another  star in glory."
46,15,42,"So also  is  the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:"
46,15,43,"It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:"
46,15,44,"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."
46,15,45,"And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam  was made  a quickening spirit."
46,15,46,"Howbeit that  was  not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual."
46,15,47,"The first man  is  of the earth, earthy: the second man  is  the Lord from heaven."
46,15,48,"As  is  the earthy, such  are  they also that are earthy: and as  is  the heavenly, such  are  they also that are heavenly."
46,15,49,"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."
46,15,50,"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption."
46,15,51,"Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,"
46,15,52,"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
46,15,53,"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal  must  put on immortality."
46,15,54,"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
46,15,55,"O death, where  is  thy sting? O grave, where  is  thy victory?"
46,15,56,"The sting of death  is  sin; and the strength of sin  is  the law."
46,15,57,"But thanks  be  to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
46,15,58,"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."
46,16,1,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye."
46,16,2,"Upon the first  day  of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as  God  hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come."
46,16,3,"And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by  your  letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem."
46,16,4,"And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me."
46,16,5,"Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia."
46,16,6,"And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go."
46,16,7,"For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit."
46,16,8,"But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost."
46,16,9,"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and  there are  many adversaries."
46,16,10,"Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also  do ."
46,16,11,"Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren."
46,16,12,"As touching  our  brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time."
46,16,13,"Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong."
46,16,14,"Let all your things be done with charity."
46,16,15,"I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and  that  they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)"
46,16,16,"That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with  us , and laboureth."
46,16,17,"I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied."
46,16,18,"For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such."
46,16,19,"The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."
46,16,20,"All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss."
46,16,21,"The salutation of  me  Paul with mine own hand."
46,16,22,"If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha."
46,16,23,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ  be  with you."
46,16,24,"My love  be  with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.   The first  epistle  to the Corinthians was written from Philippi by Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, and Timotheus."
47,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy  our  brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:"
47,1,2,"Grace  be  to you and peace from God our Father, and  from  the Lord Jesus Christ."
47,1,3,"Blessed  be  God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;"
47,1,4,"Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God."
47,1,5,"For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ."
47,1,6,"And whether we be afflicted,  it is  for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted,  it is  for your consolation and salvation."
47,1,7,"And our hope of you  is  stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so  shall ye be  also of the consolation."
47,1,8,"For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:"
47,1,9,"But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:"
47,1,10,"Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver  us ;"
47,1,11,"Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift  bestowed  upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf."
47,1,12,"For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward."
47,1,13,"For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;"
47,1,14,"As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also  are  ours in the day of the Lord Jesus."
47,1,15,"And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;"
47,1,16,"And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea."
47,1,17,"When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?"
47,1,18,"But  as  God  is  true, our word toward you was not yea and nay."
47,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us,  even  by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea."
47,1,20,"For all the promises of God in him  are  yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us."
47,1,21,"Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us,  is  God;"
47,1,22,"Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
47,1,23,"Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth."
47,1,24,"Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand."
47,2,1,"But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness."
47,2,2,"For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?"
47,2,3,"And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is  the joy  of you all."
47,2,4,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you."
47,2,5,"But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all."
47,2,6,"Sufficient to such a man  is  this punishment, which  was inflicted  of many."
47,2,7,"So that contrariwise ye  ought  rather to forgive  him , and comfort  him , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow."
47,2,8,"Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm  your  love toward him."
47,2,9,"For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things."
47,2,10,"To whom ye forgive any thing, I  forgive  also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave  it , for your sakes  forgave I it  in the person of Christ;"
47,2,11,"Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices."
47,2,12,"Furthermore, when I came to Troas to  preach  Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,"
47,2,13,"I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia."
47,2,14,"Now thanks  be  unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place."
47,2,15,"For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:"
47,2,16,"To the one  we are  the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who  is  sufficient for these things?"
47,2,17,"For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ."
47,3,1,"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some  others , epistles of commendation to you, or  letters  of commendation from you?"
47,3,2,"Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:"
47,3,3,"Forasmuch as ye are  manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart."
47,3,4,"And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:"
47,3,5,"Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency  is  of God;"
47,3,6,"Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life."
47,3,7,"But if the ministration of death, written  and  engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which  glory  was to be done away:"
47,3,8,"How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?"
47,3,9,"For if the ministration of condemnation  be  glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory."
47,3,10,"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth."
47,3,11,"For if that which is done away  was  glorious, much more that which remaineth  is  glorious."
47,3,12,"Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:"
47,3,13,"And not as Moses,  which  put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:"
47,3,14,"But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which  vail  is done away in Christ."
47,3,15,"But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart."
47,3,16,"Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away."
47,3,17,"Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord  is , there  is  liberty."
47,3,18,"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory,  even  as by the Spirit of the Lord."
47,4,1,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;"
47,4,2,"But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God."
47,4,3,"But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:"
47,4,4,"In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."
47,4,5,"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake."
47,4,6,"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to  give  the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
47,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."
47,4,8,"We are  troubled on every side, yet not distressed;  we are  perplexed, but not in despair;"
47,4,9,"Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;"
47,4,10,"Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body."
47,4,11,"For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh."
47,4,12,"So then death worketh in us, but life in you."
47,4,13,"We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;"
47,4,14,"Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present  us  with you."
47,4,15,"For all things  are  for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God."
47,4,16,"For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward  man  is renewed day by day."
47,4,17,"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding  and  eternal weight of glory;"
47,4,18,"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen  are  temporal; but the things which are not seen  are  eternal."
47,5,1,"For we know that if our earthly house of  this  tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
47,5,2,"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:"
47,5,3,"If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked."
47,5,4,"For we that are in  this  tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."
47,5,5,"Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing  is  God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit."
47,5,6,"Therefore  we are  always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:"
47,5,7,"(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)"
47,5,8,"We are confident,  I say , and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord."
47,5,9,"Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him."
47,5,10,"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things  done  in  his  body, according to that he hath done, whether  it be  good or bad."
47,5,11,"Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences."
47,5,12,"For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to  answer  them which glory in appearance, and not in heart."
47,5,13,"For whether we be beside ourselves,  it is  to God: or whether we be sober,  it is  for your cause."
47,5,14,"For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:"
47,5,15,"And  that  he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again."
47,5,16,"Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we  him  no more."
47,5,17,"Therefore if any man  be  in Christ,  he is  a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
47,5,18,"And all things  are  of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;"
47,5,19,"To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation."
47,5,20,"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech  you  by us: we pray  you  in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God."
47,5,21,"For he hath made him  to be  sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
47,6,1,"We then,  as  workers together  with him , beseech  you  also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain."
47,6,2,"(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now  is  the accepted time; behold, now  is  the day of salvation.)"
47,6,3,"Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:"
47,6,4,"But in all  things  approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,"
47,6,5,"In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;"
47,6,6,"By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,"
47,6,7,"By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,"
47,6,8,"By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and  yet  true;"
47,6,9,"As unknown, and  yet  well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;"
47,6,10,"As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and  yet  possessing all things."
47,6,11,"O  ye  Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged."
47,6,12,"Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels."
47,6,13,"Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto  my  children,) be ye also enlarged."
47,6,14,"Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?"
47,6,15,"And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?"
47,6,16,"And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in  them ; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
47,6,17,"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean  thing ; and I will receive you,"
47,6,18,"And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."
47,7,1,"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
47,7,2,"Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man."
47,7,3,"I speak not  this  to condemn  you : for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with  you ."
47,7,4,"Great  is  my boldness of speech toward you, great  is  my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation."
47,7,5,"For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without  were  fightings, within  were  fears."
47,7,6,"Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;"
47,7,7,"And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more."
47,7,8,"For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though  it were  but for a season."
47,7,9,"Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing."
47,7,10,"For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death."
47,7,11,"For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea,  what  clearing of yourselves, yea,  what  indignation, yea,  what  fear, yea,  what  vehement desire, yea,  what  zeal, yea,  what  revenge! In all  things  ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter."
47,7,12,"Wherefore, though I wrote unto you,  I did it  not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you."
47,7,13,"Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all."
47,7,14,"For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which  I made  before Titus, is found a truth."
47,7,15,"And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him."
47,7,16,"I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all  things ."
47,8,1,"Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;"
47,8,2,"How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality."
47,8,3,"For to  their  power, I bear record, yea, and beyond  their  power  they were  willing of themselves;"
47,8,4,"Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and  take upon us  the fellowship of the ministering to the saints."
47,8,5,"And  this they did , not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God."
47,8,6,"Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also."
47,8,7,"Therefore, as ye abound in every  thing, in  faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and  in  all diligence, and  in  your love to us,  see  that ye abound in this grace also."
47,8,8,"I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love."
47,8,9,"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich."
47,8,10,"And herein I give  my  advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago."
47,8,11,"Now therefore perform the doing  of it ; that as  there was  a readiness to will, so  there may be  a performance also out of that which ye have."
47,8,12,"For if there be first a willing mind,  it is  accepted according to that a man hath,  and  not according to that he hath not."
47,8,13,"For  I mean  not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:"
47,8,14,"But by an equality,  that  now at this time your abundance  may be a supply  for their want, that their abundance also may be  a supply  for your want: that there may be equality:"
47,8,15,"As it is written, He that  had gathered  much had nothing over; and he that  had gathered  little had no lack."
47,8,16,"But thanks  be  to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you."
47,8,17,"For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you."
47,8,18,"And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise  is  in the gospel throughout all the churches;"
47,8,19,"And not  that  only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and  declaration of  your ready mind:"
47,8,20,"Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:"
47,8,21,"Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
47,8,22,"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which  I have  in you."
47,8,23,"Whether  any do inquire  of Titus,  he is  my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren  be inquired of, they are  the messengers of the churches,  and  the glory of Christ."
47,8,24,"Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf."
47,9,1,"For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:"
47,9,2,"For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many."
47,9,3,"Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:"
47,9,4,"Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting."
47,9,5,"Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as  a matter of  bounty, and not as  of  covetousness."
47,9,6,"But this  I say , He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully."
47,9,7,"Every man according as he purposeth in his heart,  so let him give ; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."
47,9,8,"And God  is  able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all  things , may abound to every good work:"
47,9,9,"(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever."
47,9,10,"Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for  your  food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)"
47,9,11,"Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God."
47,9,12,"For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;"
47,9,13,"Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for  your  liberal distribution unto them, and unto all  men ;"
47,9,14,"And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you."
47,9,15,"Thanks  be  unto God for his unspeakable gift."
47,10,1,"Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence  am  base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:"
47,10,2,"But I beseech  you , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh."
47,10,3,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:"
47,10,4,"(For the weapons of our warfare  are  not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)"
47,10,5,"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;"
47,10,6,"And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled."
47,10,7,"Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he  is  Christ’s, even so  are  we Christ’s."
47,10,8,"For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:"
47,10,9,"That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters."
47,10,10,"For  his  letters, say they,  are  weighty and powerful; but  his  bodily presence  is  weak, and  his  speech contemptible."
47,10,11,"Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such  will we be  also in deed when we are present."
47,10,12,"For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."
47,10,13,"But we will not boast of things without  our  measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you."
47,10,14,"For we stretch not ourselves beyond  our measure , as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in  preaching  the gospel of Christ:"
47,10,15,"Not boasting of things without  our  measure,  that is , of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,"
47,10,16,"To preach the gospel in the  regions  beyond you,  and  not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand."
47,10,17,"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
47,10,18,"For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth."
47,11,1,"Would to God ye could bear with me a little in  my  folly: and indeed bear with me."
47,11,2,"For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present  you as  a chaste virgin to Christ."
47,11,3,"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."
47,11,4,"For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or  if  ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with  him ."
47,11,5,"For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles."
47,11,6,"But though  I be  rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things."
47,11,7,"Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?"
47,11,8,"I robbed other churches, taking wages  of them , to do you service."
47,11,9,"And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all  things  I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and  so  will I keep  myself ."
47,11,10,"As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia."
47,11,11,"Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth."
47,11,12,"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we."
47,11,13,"For such  are  false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ."
47,11,14,"And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light."
47,11,15,"Therefore  it is  no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works."
47,11,16,"I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little."
47,11,17,"That which I speak, I speak  it  not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting."
47,11,18,"Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also."
47,11,19,"For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye  yourselves  are wise."
47,11,20,"For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour  you , if a man take  of you , if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face."
47,11,21,"I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also."
47,11,22,"Are they Hebrews? so  am  I. Are they Israelites? so  am  I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so  am  I."
47,11,23,"Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I  am  more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft."
47,11,24,"Of the Jews five times received I forty  stripes  save one."
47,11,25,"Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;"
47,11,26,"In  journeyings often,  in  perils of waters,  in  perils of robbers,  in  perils by  mine own  countrymen,  in  perils by the heathen,  in  perils in the city,  in  perils in the wilderness,  in  perils in the sea,  in  perils among false brethren;"
47,11,27,"In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness."
47,11,28,"Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches."
47,11,29,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?"
47,11,30,"If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities."
47,11,31,"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not."
47,11,32,"In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:"
47,11,33,"And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands."
47,12,1,"It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord."
47,12,2,"I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven."
47,12,3,"And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)"
47,12,4,"How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."
47,12,5,"Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities."
47,12,6,"For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but  now  I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me  to be , or  that  he heareth of me."
47,12,7,"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure."
47,12,8,"For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me."
47,12,9,"And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."
47,12,10,"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong."
47,12,11,"I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing."
47,12,12,"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds."
47,12,13,"For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except  it be  that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong."
47,12,14,"Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
47,12,15,"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved."
47,12,16,"But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile."
47,12,17,"Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?"
47,12,18,"I desired Titus, and with  him  I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit?  walked we  not in the same steps?"
47,12,19,"Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but  we do  all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying."
47,12,20,"For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and  that  I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest  there be  debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:"
47,12,21,"And  lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and  that  I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed."
47,13,1,"This  is  the third  time  I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."
47,13,2,"I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:"
47,13,3,"Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you."
47,13,4,"For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you."
47,13,5,"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?"
47,13,6,"But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates."
47,13,7,"Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates."
47,13,8,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
47,13,9,"For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish,  even  your perfection."
47,13,10,"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction."
47,13,11,"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you."
47,13,12,"Greet one another with an holy kiss."
47,13,13,"All the saints salute you."
47,13,14,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost,  be  with you all. Amen.   The second  epistle  to the Corinthians was written from Philippi,  a city  of Macedonia, by Titus and Lucas."
48,1,1,"Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)"
48,1,2,"And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:"
48,1,3,"Grace  be  to you and peace from God the Father, and  from  our Lord Jesus Christ,"
48,1,4,"Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:"
48,1,5,"To whom  be  glory for ever and ever. Amen."
48,1,6,"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:"
48,1,7,"Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ."
48,1,8,"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."
48,1,9,"As we said before, so say I now again, If any  man  preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed."
48,1,10,"For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ."
48,1,11,"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man."
48,1,12,"For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught  it , but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."
48,1,13,"For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:"
48,1,14,"And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers."
48,1,15,"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called  me  by his grace,"
48,1,16,"To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:"
48,1,17,"Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus."
48,1,18,"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days."
48,1,19,"But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother."
48,1,20,"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not."
48,1,21,"Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;"
48,1,22,"And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:"
48,1,23,"But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed."
48,1,24,"And they glorified God in me."
48,2,1,"Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with  me  also."
48,2,2,"And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain."
48,2,3,"But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:"
48,2,4,"And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:"
48,2,5,"To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you."
48,2,6,"But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who seemed  to be somewhat  in conference added nothing to me:"
48,2,7,"But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as  the gospel  of the circumcision  was  unto Peter;"
48,2,8,"(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)"
48,2,9,"And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we  should go  unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision."
48,2,10,"Only  they would  that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do."
48,2,11,"But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed."
48,2,12,"For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision."
48,2,13,"And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation."
48,2,14,"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before  them  all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"
48,2,15,"We  who are  Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,"
48,2,16,"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."
48,2,17,"But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners,  is  therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid."
48,2,18,"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor."
48,2,19,"For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God."
48,2,20,"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."
48,2,21,"I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness  come  by the law, then Christ is dead in vain."
48,3,1,"O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?"
48,3,2,"This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
48,3,3,"Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?"
48,3,4,"Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if  it be  yet in vain."
48,3,5,"He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you,  doeth he it  by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
48,3,6,"Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."
48,3,7,"Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham."
48,3,8,"And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham,  saying , In thee shall all nations be blessed."
48,3,9,"So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham."
48,3,10,"For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed  is  every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them."
48,3,11,"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God,  it is  evident: for, The just shall live by faith."
48,3,12,"And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them."
48,3,13,"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed  is  every one that hangeth on a tree:"
48,3,14,"That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
48,3,15,"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though  it be  but a man’s covenant, yet  if it be  confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto."
48,3,16,"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."
48,3,17,"And this I say,  that  the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect."
48,3,18,"For if the inheritance  be  of the law,  it is  no more of promise: but God gave  it  to Abraham by promise."
48,3,19,"Wherefore then  serveth  the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made;  and it was  ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator."
48,3,20,"Now a mediator is not  a mediator  of one, but God is one."
48,3,21,"Is  the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law."
48,3,22,"But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."
48,3,23,"But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed."
48,3,24,"Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster  to bring us  unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith."
48,3,25,"But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."
48,3,26,"For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus."
48,3,27,"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ."
48,3,28,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus."
48,3,29,"And if ye  be  Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise."
48,4,1,"Now I say,  That  the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;"
48,4,2,"But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father."
48,4,3,"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:"
48,4,4,"But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,"
48,4,5,"To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."
48,4,6,"And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father."
48,4,7,"Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
48,4,8,"Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods."
48,4,9,"But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?"
48,4,10,"Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years."
48,4,11,"I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain."
48,4,12,"Brethren, I beseech you, be as I  am ; for I  am  as ye  are : ye have not injured me at all."
48,4,13,"Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first."
48,4,14,"And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God,  even  as Christ Jesus."
48,4,15,"Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if  it had been  possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me."
48,4,16,"Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?"
48,4,17,"They zealously affect you,  but  not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them."
48,4,18,"But  it is  good to be zealously affected always in  a  good  thing , and not only when I am present with you."
48,4,19,"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,"
48,4,20,"I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you."
48,4,21,"Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?"
48,4,22,"For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman."
48,4,23,"But he  who was  of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman  was  by promise."
48,4,24,"Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar."
48,4,25,"For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children."
48,4,26,"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all."
48,4,27,"For it is written, Rejoice,  thou  barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband."
48,4,28,"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise."
48,4,29,"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him  that was born  after the Spirit, even so  it is  now."
48,4,30,"Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman."
48,4,31,"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."
48,5,1,"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
48,5,2,"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."
48,5,3,"For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
48,5,4,"Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace."
48,5,5,"For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith."
48,5,6,"For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love."
48,5,7,"Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?"
48,5,8,"This persuasion  cometh  not of him that calleth you."
48,5,9,"A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump."
48,5,10,"I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be."
48,5,11,"And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased."
48,5,12,"I would they were even cut off which trouble you."
48,5,13,"For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only  use  not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another."
48,5,14,"For all the law is fulfilled in one word,  even  in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
48,5,15,"But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another."
48,5,16,"This  I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh."
48,5,17,"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would."
48,5,18,"But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law."
48,5,19,"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are  these ; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,"
48,5,20,"Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,"
48,5,21,"Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told  you  in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
48,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,"
48,5,23,"Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law."
48,5,24,"And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts."
48,5,25,"If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."
48,5,26,"Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another."
48,6,1,"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted."
48,6,2,"Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ."
48,6,3,"For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself."
48,6,4,"But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another."
48,6,5,"For every man shall bear his own burden."
48,6,6,"Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things."
48,6,7,"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."
48,6,8,"For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting."
48,6,9,"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."
48,6,10,"As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all  men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith."
48,6,11,"Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand."
48,6,12,"As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ."
48,6,13,"For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh."
48,6,14,"But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."
48,6,15,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature."
48,6,16,"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace  be  on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God."
48,6,17,"From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."
48,6,18,"Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ  be  with your spirit. Amen.   Unto the Galatians written from Rome."
49,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:"
49,1,2,"Grace  be  to you, and peace, from God our Father, and  from  the Lord Jesus Christ."
49,1,3,"Blessed  be  the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly  places  in Christ:"
49,1,4,"According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:"
49,1,5,"Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,"
49,1,6,"To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved."
49,1,7,"In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;"
49,1,8,"Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;"
49,1,9,"Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:"
49,1,10,"That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth;  even  in him:"
49,1,11,"In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:"
49,1,12,"That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ."
49,1,13,"In whom ye also  trusted , after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,"
49,1,14,"Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory."
49,1,15,"Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,"
49,1,16,"Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;"
49,1,17,"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:"
49,1,18,"The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,"
49,1,19,"And what  is  the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,"
49,1,20,"Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set  him  at his own right hand in the heavenly  places ,"
49,1,21,"Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:"
49,1,22,"And hath put all  things  under his feet, and gave him  to be  the head over all  things  to the church,"
49,1,23,"Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all."
49,2,1,"And you  hath he quickened , who were dead in trespasses and sins;"
49,2,2,"Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:"
49,2,3,"Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others."
49,2,4,"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,"
49,2,5,"Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)"
49,2,6,"And hath raised  us  up together, and made  us  sit together in heavenly  places  in Christ Jesus:"
49,2,7,"That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in  his  kindness toward us through Christ Jesus."
49,2,8,"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves:  it is  the gift of God:"
49,2,9,"Not of works, lest any man should boast."
49,2,10,"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."
49,2,11,"Wherefore remember, that ye  being  in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;"
49,2,12,"That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:"
49,2,13,"But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ."
49,2,14,"For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition  between us ;"
49,2,15,"Having abolished in his flesh the enmity,  even  the law of commandments  contained  in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man,  so  making peace;"
49,2,16,"And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:"
49,2,17,"And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh."
49,2,18,"For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father."
49,2,19,"Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;"
49,2,20,"And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner  stone ;"
49,2,21,"In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:"
49,2,22,"In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit."
49,3,1,"For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,"
49,3,2,"If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:"
49,3,3,"How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,"
49,3,4,"Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)"
49,3,5,"Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;"
49,3,6,"That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:"
49,3,7,"Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power."
49,3,8,"Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;"
49,3,9,"And to make all  men  see what  is  the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:"
49,3,10,"To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly  places  might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,"
49,3,11,"According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:"
49,3,12,"In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him."
49,3,13,"Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory."
49,3,14,"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
49,3,15,"Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,"
49,3,16,"That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;"
49,3,17,"That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,"
49,3,18,"May be able to comprehend with all saints what  is  the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;"
49,3,19,"And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God."
49,3,20,"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,"
49,3,21,"Unto him  be  glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."
49,4,1,"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,"
49,4,2,"With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;"
49,4,3,"Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
49,4,4,"There is  one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;"
49,4,5,"One Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
49,4,6,"One God and Father of all, who  is  above all, and through all, and in you all."
49,4,7,"But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ."
49,4,8,"Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men."
49,4,9,"(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"
49,4,10,"He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)"
49,4,11,"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;"
49,4,12,"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:"
49,4,13,"Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:"
49,4,14,"That we  henceforth  be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men,  and  cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;"
49,4,15,"But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head,  even  Christ:"
49,4,16,"From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
49,4,17,"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,"
49,4,18,"Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:"
49,4,19,"Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness."
49,4,20,"But ye have not so learned Christ;"
49,4,21,"If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:"
49,4,22,"That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;"
49,4,23,"And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;"
49,4,24,"And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."
49,4,25,"Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another."
49,4,26,"Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:"
49,4,27,"Neither give place to the devil."
49,4,28,"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with  his  hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth."
49,4,29,"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers."
49,4,30,"And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption."
49,4,31,"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:"
49,4,32,"And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you."
49,5,1,"Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;"
49,5,2,"And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour."
49,5,3,"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;"
49,5,4,"Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks."
49,5,5,"For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
49,5,6,"Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience."
49,5,7,"Be not ye therefore partakers with them."
49,5,8,"For ye were sometimes darkness, but now  are ye  light in the Lord: walk as children of light:"
49,5,9,"(For the fruit of the Spirit  is  in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)"
49,5,10,"Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord."
49,5,11,"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove  them ."
49,5,12,"For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret."
49,5,13,"But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light."
49,5,14,"Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light."
49,5,15,"See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,"
49,5,16,"Redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
49,5,17,"Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord  is ."
49,5,18,"And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;"
49,5,19,"Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;"
49,5,20,"Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
49,5,21,"Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God."
49,5,22,"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord."
49,5,23,"For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body."
49,5,24,"Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so  let  the wives  be  to their own husbands in every thing."
49,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;"
49,5,26,"That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,"
49,5,27,"That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."
49,5,28,"So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself."
49,5,29,"For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:"
49,5,30,"For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."
49,5,31,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh."
49,5,32,"This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church."
49,5,33,"Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife  see  that she reverence  her  husband."
49,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right."
49,6,2,"Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)"
49,6,3,"That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth."
49,6,4,"And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."
49,6,5,"Servants, be obedient to them that are  your  masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;"
49,6,6,"Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;"
49,6,7,"With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:"
49,6,8,"Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether  he be  bond or free."
49,6,9,"And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him."
49,6,10,"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might."
49,6,11,"Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
49,6,12,"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high  places ."
49,6,13,"Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
49,6,14,"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;"
49,6,15,"And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;"
49,6,16,"Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."
49,6,17,"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:"
49,6,18,"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;"
49,6,19,"And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,"
49,6,20,"For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
49,6,21,"But that ye also may know my affairs,  and  how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:"
49,6,22,"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and  that  he might comfort your hearts."
49,6,23,"Peace  be  to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
49,6,24,"Grace  be  with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.   Written from Rome unto the Ephesians by Tychicus."
50,1,1,"Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:"
50,1,2,"Grace  be  unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and  from  the Lord Jesus Christ."
50,1,3,"I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,"
50,1,4,"Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,"
50,1,5,"For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;"
50,1,6,"Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform  it  until the day of Jesus Christ:"
50,1,7,"Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace."
50,1,8,"For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ."
50,1,9,"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and  in  all judgment;"
50,1,10,"That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;"
50,1,11,"Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God."
50,1,12,"But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things  which happened  unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;"
50,1,13,"So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other  places ;"
50,1,14,"And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear."
50,1,15,"Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:"
50,1,16,"The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:"
50,1,17,"But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel."
50,1,18,"What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice."
50,1,19,"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"
50,1,20,"According to my earnest expectation and  my  hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but  that  with all boldness, as always,  so  now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether  it be  by life, or by death."
50,1,21,"For to me to live  is  Christ, and to die  is  gain."
50,1,22,"But if I live in the flesh, this  is  the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not."
50,1,23,"For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:"
50,1,24,"Nevertheless to abide in the flesh  is  more needful for you."
50,1,25,"And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;"
50,1,26,"That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again."
50,1,27,"Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;"
50,1,28,"And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God."
50,1,29,"For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;"
50,1,30,"Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear  to be  in me."
50,2,1,"If  there be  therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,"
50,2,2,"Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love,  being  of one accord, of one mind."
50,2,3,"Let  nothing  be done  through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves."
50,2,4,"Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others."
50,2,5,"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:"
50,2,6,"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:"
50,2,7,"But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:"
50,2,8,"And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."
50,2,9,"Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:"
50,2,10,"That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of  things  in heaven, and  things  in earth, and  things  under the earth;"
50,2,11,"And  that  every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ  is  Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
50,2,12,"Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
50,2,13,"For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of  his  good pleasure."
50,2,14,"Do all things without murmurings and disputings:"
50,2,15,"That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;"
50,2,16,"Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain."
50,2,17,"Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all."
50,2,18,"For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me."
50,2,19,"But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state."
50,2,20,"For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state."
50,2,21,"For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s."
50,2,22,"But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel."
50,2,23,"Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me."
50,2,24,"But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly."
50,2,25,"Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants."
50,2,26,"For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick."
50,2,27,"For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow."
50,2,28,"I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful."
50,2,29,"Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:"
50,2,30,"Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me."
50,3,1,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed  is  not grievous, but for you  it is  safe."
50,3,2,"Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision."
50,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh."
50,3,4,"Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:"
50,3,5,"Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel,  of  the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;"
50,3,6,"Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless."
50,3,7,"But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ."
50,3,8,"Yea doubtless, and I count all things  but  loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them  but  dung, that I may win Christ,"
50,3,9,"And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:"
50,3,10,"That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;"
50,3,11,"If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead."
50,3,12,"Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus."
50,3,13,"Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but  this  one thing  I do , forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,"
50,3,14,"I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
50,3,15,"Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you."
50,3,16,"Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing."
50,3,17,"Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample."
50,3,18,"(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping,  that they are  the enemies of the cross of Christ:"
50,3,19,"Whose end  is  destruction, whose God  is their  belly, and  whose  glory  is  in their shame, who mind earthly things.)"
50,3,20,"For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:"
50,3,21,"Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself."
50,4,1,"Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord,  my  dearly beloved."
50,4,2,"I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord."
50,4,3,"And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and  with  other my fellowlabourers, whose names  are  in the book of life."
50,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord alway:  and  again I say, Rejoice."
50,4,5,"Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord  is  at hand."
50,4,6,"Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God."
50,4,7,"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
50,4,8,"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things  are  honest, whatsoever things  are  just, whatsoever things  are  pure, whatsoever things  are  lovely, whatsoever things  are  of good report; if  there be  any virtue, and if  there be  any praise, think on these things."
50,4,9,"Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you."
50,4,10,"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity."
50,4,11,"Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am,  therewith  to be content."
50,4,12,"I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need."
50,4,13,"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."
50,4,14,"Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction."
50,4,15,"Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only."
50,4,16,"For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity."
50,4,17,"Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account."
50,4,18,"But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things  which were sent  from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God."
50,4,19,"But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus."
50,4,20,"Now unto God and our Father  be  glory for ever and ever. Amen."
50,4,21,"Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you."
50,4,22,"All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household."
50,4,23,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ  be  with you all. Amen.   It was written to the Philippians from Rome by Epaphroditus."
51,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus  our  brother,"
51,1,2,"To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace  be  unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
51,1,3,"We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
51,1,4,"Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love  which ye have  to all the saints,"
51,1,5,"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;"
51,1,6,"Which is come unto you, as  it is  in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as  it doth  also in you, since the day ye heard  of it , and knew the grace of God in truth:"
51,1,7,"As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;"
51,1,8,"Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit."
51,1,9,"For this cause we also, since the day we heard  it , do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;"
51,1,10,"That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;"
51,1,11,"Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;"
51,1,12,"Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:"
51,1,13,"Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated  us  into the kingdom of his dear Son:"
51,1,14,"In whom we have redemption through his blood,  even  the forgiveness of sins:"
51,1,15,"Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:"
51,1,16,"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether  they be  thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:"
51,1,17,"And he is before all things, and by him all things consist."
51,1,18,"And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all  things  he might have the preeminence."
51,1,19,"For it pleased  the Father  that in him should all fulness dwell;"
51,1,20,"And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him,  I say , whether  they be  things in earth, or things in heaven."
51,1,21,"And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in  your  mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled"
51,1,22,"In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:"
51,1,23,"If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and  be  not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard,  and  which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;"
51,1,24,"Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church:"
51,1,25,"Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;"
51,1,26,"Even  the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:"
51,1,27,"To whom God would make known what  is  the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:"
51,1,28,"Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:"
51,1,29,"Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily."
51,2,1,"For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and  for  them at Laodicea, and  for  as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;"
51,2,2,"That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;"
51,2,3,"In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
51,2,4,"And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words."
51,2,5,"For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ."
51,2,6,"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord,  so  walk ye in him:"
51,2,7,"Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving."
51,2,8,"Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ."
51,2,9,"For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily."
51,2,10,"And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:"
51,2,11,"In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:"
51,2,12,"Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with  him  through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead."
51,2,13,"And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;"
51,2,14,"Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;"
51,2,15,"And  having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it."
51,2,16,"Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath  days :"
51,2,17,"Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body  is  of Christ."
51,2,18,"Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,"
51,2,19,"And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God."
51,2,20,"Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,"
51,2,21,"(Touch not; taste not; handle not;"
51,2,22,"Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?"
51,2,23,"Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh."
51,3,1,"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God."
51,3,2,"Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."
51,3,3,"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."
51,3,4,"When Christ,  who is  our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory."
51,3,5,"Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:"
51,3,6,"For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:"
51,3,7,"In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them."
51,3,8,"But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."
51,3,9,"Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;"
51,3,10,"And have put on the new  man , which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:"
51,3,11,"Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond  nor  free: but Christ  is  all, and in all."
51,3,12,"Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;"
51,3,13,"Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also  do  ye."
51,3,14,"And above all these things  put on  charity, which is the bond of perfectness."
51,3,15,"And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful."
51,3,16,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord."
51,3,17,"And whatsoever ye do in word or deed,  do  all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him."
51,3,18,"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord."
51,3,19,"Husbands, love  your  wives, and be not bitter against them."
51,3,20,"Children, obey  your  parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord."
51,3,21,"Fathers, provoke not your children  to anger , lest they be discouraged."
51,3,22,"Servants, obey in all things  your  masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:"
51,3,23,"And whatsoever ye do, do  it  heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;"
51,3,24,"Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ."
51,3,25,"But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons."
51,4,1,"Masters, give unto  your  servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven."
51,4,2,"Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;"
51,4,3,"Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:"
51,4,4,"That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak."
51,4,5,"Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time."
51,4,6,"Let your speech  be  alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man."
51,4,7,"All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you,  who is  a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:"
51,4,8,"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;"
51,4,9,"With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is  one  of you. They shall make known unto you all things which  are done  here."
51,4,10,"Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)"
51,4,11,"And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only  are my  fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me."
51,4,12,"Epaphras, who is  one  of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God."
51,4,13,"For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them  that are  in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis."
51,4,14,"Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you."
51,4,15,"Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house."
51,4,16,"And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the  epistle  from Laodicea."
51,4,17,"And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it."
51,4,18,"The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace  be  with you. Amen.   Written from Rome to the Colossians by Tychicus and Onesimus."
52,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians  which is  in God the Father and  in  the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace  be  unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
52,1,2,"We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;"
52,1,3,"Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;"
52,1,4,"Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God."
52,1,5,"For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake."
52,1,6,"And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:"
52,1,7,"So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia."
52,1,8,"For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing."
52,1,9,"For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;"
52,1,10,"And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,  even  Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come."
52,2,1,"For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:"
52,2,2,"But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention."
52,2,3,"For our exhortation  was  not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:"
52,2,4,"But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts."
52,2,5,"For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God  is  witness:"
52,2,6,"Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor  yet  of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ."
52,2,7,"But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:"
52,2,8,"So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us."
52,2,9,"For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God."
52,2,10,"Ye  are  witnesses, and God  also , how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:"
52,2,11,"As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father  doth  his children,"
52,2,12,"That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory."
52,2,13,"For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received  it  not  as  the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe."
52,2,14,"For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they  have  of the Jews:"
52,2,15,"Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:"
52,2,16,"Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost."
52,2,17,"But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire."
52,2,18,"Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us."
52,2,19,"For what  is  our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?  Are  not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?"
52,2,20,"For ye are our glory and joy."
52,3,1,"Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;"
52,3,2,"And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:"
52,3,3,"That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto."
52,3,4,"For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know."
52,3,5,"For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain."
52,3,6,"But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also  to see  you:"
52,3,7,"Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:"
52,3,8,"For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord."
52,3,9,"For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;"
52,3,10,"Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
52,3,11,"Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you."
52,3,12,"And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all  men , even as we  do  toward you:"
52,3,13,"To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."
52,4,1,"Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort  you  by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God,  so  ye would abound more and more."
52,4,2,"For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus."
52,4,3,"For this is the will of God,  even  your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:"
52,4,4,"That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;"
52,4,5,"Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:"
52,4,6,"That no  man  go beyond and defraud his brother in  any  matter: because that the Lord  is  the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified."
52,4,7,"For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness."
52,4,8,"He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit."
52,4,9,"But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another."
52,4,10,"And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;"
52,4,11,"And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;"
52,4,12,"That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and  that  ye may have lack of nothing."
52,4,13,"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope."
52,4,14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him."
52,4,15,"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive  and  remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep."
52,4,16,"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:"
52,4,17,"Then we which are alive  and  remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."
52,4,18,"Wherefore comfort one another with these words."
52,5,1,"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you."
52,5,2,"For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night."
52,5,3,"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape."
52,5,4,"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."
52,5,5,"Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."
52,5,6,"Therefore let us not sleep, as  do  others; but let us watch and be sober."
52,5,7,"For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night."
52,5,8,"But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation."
52,5,9,"For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,"
52,5,10,"Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him."
52,5,11,"Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do."
52,5,12,"And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;"
52,5,13,"And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake.  And  be at peace among yourselves."
52,5,14,"Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all  men ."
52,5,15,"See that none render evil for evil unto any  man ; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all  men ."
52,5,16,"Rejoice evermore."
52,5,17,"Pray without ceasing."
52,5,18,"In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."
52,5,19,"Quench not the Spirit."
52,5,20,"Despise not prophesyings."
52,5,21,"Prove all things; hold fast that which is good."
52,5,22,"Abstain from all appearance of evil."
52,5,23,"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and  I pray God  your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
52,5,24,"Faithful  is  he that calleth you, who also will do  it ."
52,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us."
52,5,26,"Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss."
52,5,27,"I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren."
52,5,28,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ  be  with you. Amen.   The first  epistle  unto the Thessalonians was written from Athens."
53,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
53,1,2,"Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,1,3,"We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;"
53,1,4,"So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:"
53,1,5,"Which is  a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:"
53,1,6,"Seeing  it is  a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;"
53,1,7,"And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,"
53,1,8,"In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
53,1,9,"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"
53,1,10,"When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day."
53,1,11,"Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of  this  calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of  his  goodness, and the work of faith with power:"
53,1,12,"That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,1,"Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and  by  our gathering together unto him,"
53,2,2,"That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand."
53,2,3,"Let no man deceive you by any means: for  that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;"
53,2,4,"Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God."
53,2,5,"Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"
53,2,6,"And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time."
53,2,7,"For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth  will let , until he be taken out of the way."
53,2,8,"And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:"
53,2,9,"Even him , whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,"
53,2,10,"And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
53,2,11,"And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:"
53,2,12,"That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
53,2,13,"But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:"
53,2,14,"Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,15,"Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle."
53,2,16,"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given  us  everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,"
53,2,17,"Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work."
53,3,1,"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have  free  course, and be glorified, even as  it is  with you:"
53,3,2,"And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all  men  have not faith."
53,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep  you  from evil."
53,3,4,"And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you."
53,3,5,"And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ."
53,3,6,"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us."
53,3,7,"For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;"
53,3,8,"Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:"
53,3,9,"Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us."
53,3,10,"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
53,3,11,"For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies."
53,3,12,"Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread."
53,3,13,"But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing."
53,3,14,"And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed."
53,3,15,"Yet count  him  not as an enemy, but admonish  him  as a brother."
53,3,16,"Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord  be  with you all."
53,3,17,"The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write."
53,3,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ  be  with you all. Amen.   The second  epistle  to the Thessalonians was written from Athens."
54,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ,  which is  our hope;"
54,1,2,"Unto Timothy,  my  own son in the faith: Grace, mercy,  and  peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord."
54,1,3,"As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,"
54,1,4,"Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith:  so do ."
54,1,5,"Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and  of  a good conscience, and  of  faith unfeigned:"
54,1,6,"From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;"
54,1,7,"Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm."
54,1,8,"But we know that the law  is  good, if a man use it lawfully;"
54,1,9,"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
54,1,10,"For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;"
54,1,11,"According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust."
54,1,12,"And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;"
54,1,13,"Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did  it  ignorantly in unbelief."
54,1,14,"And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
54,1,15,"This  is  a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."
54,1,16,"Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting."
54,1,17,"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,  be  honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen."
54,1,18,"This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;"
54,1,19,"Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:"
54,1,20,"Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."
54,2,1,"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,  and  giving of thanks, be made for all men;"
54,2,2,"For kings, and  for  all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."
54,2,3,"For this  is  good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;"
54,2,4,"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."
54,2,5,"For  there is  one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;"
54,2,6,"Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time."
54,2,7,"Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ,  and  lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity."
54,2,8,"I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting."
54,2,9,"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;"
54,2,10,"But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works."
54,2,11,"Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection."
54,2,12,"But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."
54,2,13,"For Adam was first formed, then Eve."
54,2,14,"And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression."
54,2,15,"Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety."
54,3,1,"This  is  a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work."
54,3,2,"A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;"
54,3,3,"Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;"
54,3,4,"One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;"
54,3,5,"(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)"
54,3,6,"Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil."
54,3,7,"Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil."
54,3,8,"Likewise  must  the deacons  be  grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;"
54,3,9,"Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience."
54,3,10,"And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being  found  blameless."
54,3,11,"Even so  must their  wives  be  grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things."
54,3,12,"Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
54,3,13,"For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus."
54,3,14,"These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:"
54,3,15,"But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
54,3,16,"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."
54,4,1,"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;"
54,4,2,"Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;"
54,4,3,"Forbidding to marry,  and commanding  to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth."
54,4,4,"For every creature of God  is  good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:"
54,4,5,"For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer."
54,4,6,"If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained."
54,4,7,"But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself  rather  unto godliness."
54,4,8,"For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."
54,4,9,"This  is  a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation."
54,4,10,"For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe."
54,4,11,"These things command and teach."
54,4,12,"Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."
54,4,13,"Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."
54,4,14,"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery."
54,4,15,"Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all."
54,4,16,"Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee."
54,5,1,"Rebuke not an elder, but intreat  him  as a father;  and  the younger men as brethren;"
54,5,2,"The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity."
54,5,3,"Honour widows that are widows indeed."
54,5,4,"But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God."
54,5,5,"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day."
54,5,6,"But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth."
54,5,7,"And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless."
54,5,8,"But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel."
54,5,9,"Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,"
54,5,10,"Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work."
54,5,11,"But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;"
54,5,12,"Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith."
54,5,13,"And withal they learn  to be  idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not."
54,5,14,"I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully."
54,5,15,"For some are already turned aside after Satan."
54,5,16,"If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed."
54,5,17,"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine."
54,5,18,"For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer  is  worthy of his reward."
54,5,19,"Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses."
54,5,20,"Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear."
54,5,21,"I charge  thee  before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality."
54,5,22,"Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure."
54,5,23,"Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities."
54,5,24,"Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some  men  they follow after."
54,5,25,"Likewise also the good works  of some  are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid."
54,6,1,"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and  his  doctrine be not blasphemed."
54,6,2,"And they that have believing masters, let them not despise  them , because they are brethren; but rather do  them  service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort."
54,6,3,"If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words,  even  the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;"
54,6,4,"He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,"
54,6,5,"Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself."
54,6,6,"But godliness with contentment is great gain."
54,6,7,"For we brought nothing into  this  world,  and it is  certain we can carry nothing out."
54,6,8,"And having food and raiment let us be therewith content."
54,6,9,"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and  into  many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition."
54,6,10,"For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
54,6,11,"But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness."
54,6,12,"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses."
54,6,13,"I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and  before  Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;"
54,6,14,"That thou keep  this  commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
54,6,15,"Which in his times he shall shew,  who is  the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;"
54,6,16,"Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom  be  honour and power everlasting. Amen."
54,6,17,"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;"
54,6,18,"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;"
54,6,19,"Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."
54,6,20,"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane  and  vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:"
54,6,21,"Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace  be  with thee. Amen.   The first to Timothy was written from Laodicea, which is the chiefest city of Phrygia Pacatiana."
55,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,"
55,1,2,"To Timothy,  my  dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy,  and  peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
55,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve from  my  forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;"
55,1,4,"Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;"
55,1,5,"When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also."
55,1,6,"Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands."
55,1,7,"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."
55,1,8,"Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;"
55,1,9,"Who hath saved us, and called  us  with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,"
55,1,10,"But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:"
55,1,11,"Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."
55,1,12,"For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day."
55,1,13,"Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
55,1,14,"That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us."
55,1,15,"This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes."
55,1,16,"The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:"
55,1,17,"But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found  me ."
55,1,18,"The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well."
55,2,1,"Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
55,2,2,"And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."
55,2,3,"Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ."
55,2,4,"No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of  this  life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier."
55,2,5,"And if a man also strive for masteries,  yet  is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully."
55,2,6,"The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits."
55,2,7,"Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things."
55,2,8,"Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:"
55,2,9,"Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer,  even  unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound."
55,2,10,"Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
55,2,11,"It is  a faithful saying: For if we be dead with  him , we shall also live with  him :"
55,2,12,"If we suffer, we shall also reign with  him : if we deny  him , he also will deny us:"
55,2,13,"If we believe not,  yet  he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself."
55,2,14,"Of these things put  them  in remembrance, charging  them  before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit,  but  to the subverting of the hearers."
55,2,15,"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
55,2,16,"But shun profane  and  vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness."
55,2,17,"And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;"
55,2,18,"Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some."
55,2,19,"Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity."
55,2,20,"But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour."
55,2,21,"If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use,  and  prepared unto every good work."
55,2,22,"Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
55,2,23,"But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes."
55,2,24,"And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all  men , apt to teach, patient,"
55,2,25,"In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;"
55,2,26,"And  that  they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will."
55,3,1,"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."
55,3,2,"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,"
55,3,3,"Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,"
55,3,4,"Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;"
55,3,5,"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away."
55,3,6,"For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,"
55,3,7,"Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
55,3,8,"Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith."
55,3,9,"But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all  men , as theirs also was."
55,3,10,"But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,"
55,3,11,"Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of  them  all the Lord delivered me."
55,3,12,"Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
55,3,13,"But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived."
55,3,14,"But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned  them ;"
55,3,15,"And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."
55,3,16,"All scripture  is  given by inspiration of God, and  is  profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:"
55,3,17,"That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works."
55,4,1,"I charge  thee  therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;"
55,4,2,"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine."
55,4,3,"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;"
55,4,4,"And they shall turn away  their  ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables."
55,4,5,"But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry."
55,4,6,"For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand."
55,4,7,"I have fought a good fight, I have finished  my  course, I have kept the faith:"
55,4,8,"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing."
55,4,9,"Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:"
55,4,10,"For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia."
55,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry."
55,4,12,"And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus."
55,4,13,"The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring  with thee , and the books,  but  especially the parchments."
55,4,14,"Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:"
55,4,15,"Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words."
55,4,16,"At my first answer no man stood with me, but all  men  forsook me:  I pray God  that it may not be laid to their charge."
55,4,17,"Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and  that  all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion."
55,4,18,"And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve  me  unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom  be  glory for ever and ever. Amen."

55,4,20,"Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick."
55,4,21,"Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren."
55,4,22,"The Lord Jesus Christ  be  with thy spirit. Grace  be  with you. Amen.   The second  epistle  unto Timotheus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians, was written from Rome, when Paul was brought before Nero the second time."
56,1,1,"Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;"
56,1,2,"In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;"
56,1,3,"But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;"
56,1,4,"To Titus,  mine  own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy,  and  peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour."
56,1,5,"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:"
56,1,6,"If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly."
56,1,7,"For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;"
56,1,8,"But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;"
56,1,9,"Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers."
56,1,10,"For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:"
56,1,11,"Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake."
56,1,12,"One of themselves,  even  a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians  are  alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies."
56,1,13,"This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;"
56,1,14,"Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth."
56,1,15,"Unto the pure all things  are  pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving  is  nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled."
56,1,16,"They profess that they know God; but in works they deny  him , being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate."
56,2,1,"But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:"
56,2,2,"That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience."
56,2,3,"The aged women likewise, that  they be  in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;"
56,2,4,"That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,"
56,2,5,"To be  discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed."
56,2,6,"Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded."
56,2,7,"In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine  shewing  uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,"
56,2,8,"Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you."
56,2,9,"Exhort  servants to be obedient unto their own masters,  and  to please  them  well in all  things ; not answering again;"
56,2,10,"Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things."
56,2,11,"For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,"
56,2,12,"Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;"
56,2,13,"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;"
56,2,14,"Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."
56,2,15,"These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee."
56,3,1,"Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,"
56,3,2,"To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers,  but  gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men."
56,3,3,"For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful,  and  hating one another."
56,3,4,"But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,"
56,3,5,"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;"
56,3,6,"Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;"
56,3,7,"That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
56,3,8,"This is  a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men."
56,3,9,"But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain."
56,3,10,"A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;"
56,3,11,"Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself."
56,3,12,"When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter."
56,3,13,"Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them."
56,3,14,"And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful."
56,3,15,"All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace  be  with you all. Amen.   It was written to Titus, ordained the first bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia."
57,1,1,"Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy  our  brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,"
57,1,2,"And to  our  beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:"
57,1,3,"Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
57,1,4,"I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,"
57,1,5,"Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;"
57,1,6,"That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus."
57,1,7,"For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother."
57,1,8,"Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,"
57,1,9,"Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech  thee , being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ."
57,1,10,"I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:"
57,1,11,"Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:"
57,1,12,"Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:"
57,1,13,"Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:"
57,1,14,"But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly."
57,1,15,"For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;"
57,1,16,"Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?"
57,1,17,"If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself."
57,1,18,"If he hath wronged thee, or oweth  thee  ought, put that on mine account;"
57,1,19,"I Paul have written  it  with mine own hand, I will repay  it : albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides."
57,1,20,"Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord."
57,1,21,"Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say."
57,1,22,"But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you."
57,1,23,"There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;"
57,1,24,"Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers."
57,1,25,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ  be  with your spirit. Amen.   Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant."
58,1,1,"God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,"
58,1,2,"Hath in these last days spoken unto us by  his  Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;"
58,1,3,"Who being the brightness of  his  glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;"
58,1,4,"Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they."
58,1,5,"For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"
58,1,6,"And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him."
58,1,7,"And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire."
58,1,8,"But unto the Son  he saith , Thy throne, O God,  is  for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness  is  the sceptre of thy kingdom."
58,1,9,"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God,  even  thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."
58,1,10,"And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:"
58,1,11,"They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;"
58,1,12,"And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail."
58,1,13,"But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?"
58,1,14,"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?"
58,2,1,"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let  them  slip."
58,2,2,"For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;"
58,2,3,"How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard  him ;"
58,2,4,"God also bearing  them  witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?"
58,2,5,"For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak."
58,2,6,"But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?"
58,2,7,"Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:"
58,2,8,"Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing  that is  not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him."
58,2,9,"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man."
58,2,10,"For it became him, for whom  are  all things, and by whom  are  all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
58,2,11,"For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified  are  all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,"
58,2,12,"Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee."
58,2,13,"And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me."
58,2,14,"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;"
58,2,15,"And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."
58,2,16,"For verily he took not on  him the nature of  angels; but he took on  him  the seed of Abraham."
58,2,17,"Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto  his  brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things  pertaining  to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people."
58,2,18,"For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted."
58,3,1,"Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;"
58,3,2,"Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses  was faithful  in all his house."
58,3,3,"For this  man  was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house."
58,3,4,"For every house is builded by some  man ; but he that built all things  is  God."
58,3,5,"And Moses verily  was  faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;"
58,3,6,"But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end."
58,3,7,"Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,"
58,3,8,"Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:"
58,3,9,"When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years."
58,3,10,"Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in  their  heart; and they have not known my ways."
58,3,11,"So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)"
58,3,12,"Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God."
58,3,13,"But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."
58,3,14,"For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;"
58,3,15,"While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation."
58,3,16,"For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses."
58,3,17,"But with whom was he grieved forty years?  was it  not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?"
58,3,18,"And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?"
58,3,19,"So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief."
58,4,1,"Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left  us  of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it."
58,4,2,"For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard  it ."
58,4,3,"For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world."
58,4,4,"For he spake in a certain place of the seventh  day  on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works."
58,4,5,"And in this  place  again, If they shall enter into my rest."
58,4,6,"Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:"
58,4,7,"Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
58,4,8,"For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day."
58,4,9,"There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God."
58,4,10,"For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God  did  from his."
58,4,11,"Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief."
58,4,12,"For the word of God  is  quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and  is  a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
58,4,13,"Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things  are  naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
58,4,14,"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast  our  profession."
58,4,15,"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as  we are, yet  without sin."
58,4,16,"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."
58,5,1,"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things  pertaining  to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:"
58,5,2,"Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity."
58,5,3,"And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins."
58,5,4,"And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as  was  Aaron."
58,5,5,"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee."
58,5,6,"As he saith also in another  place , Thou  art  a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
58,5,7,"Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;"
58,5,8,"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;"
58,5,9,"And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;"
58,5,10,"Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec."
58,5,11,"Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing."
58,5,12,"For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which  be  the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat."
58,5,13,"For every one that useth milk  is  unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe."
58,5,14,"But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age,  even  those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
58,6,1,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,"
58,6,2,"Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."
58,6,3,"And this will we do, if God permit."
58,6,4,"For  it is  impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,"
58,6,5,"And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,"
58,6,6,"If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put  him  to an open shame."
58,6,7,"For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:"
58,6,8,"But that which beareth thorns and briers  is  rejected, and  is  nigh unto cursing; whose end  is  to be burned."
58,6,9,"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak."
58,6,10,"For God  is  not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister."
58,6,11,"And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:"
58,6,12,"That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
58,6,13,"For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,"
58,6,14,"Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee."
58,6,15,"And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."
58,6,16,"For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation  is  to them an end of all strife."
58,6,17,"Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed  it  by an oath:"
58,6,18,"That by two immutable things, in which  it was  impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:"
58,6,19,"Which  hope  we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;"
58,6,20,"Whither the forerunner is for us entered,  even  Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
58,7,1,"For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;"
58,7,2,"To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;"
58,7,3,"Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually."
58,7,4,"Now consider how great this man  was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils."
58,7,5,"And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:"
58,7,6,"But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises."
58,7,7,"And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better."
58,7,8,"And here men that die receive tithes; but there he  receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth."
58,7,9,"And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham."
58,7,10,"For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him."
58,7,11,"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need  was there  that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?"
58,7,12,"For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law."
58,7,13,"For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar."
58,7,14,"For  it is  evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood."
58,7,15,"And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,"
58,7,16,"Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life."
58,7,17,"For he testifieth, Thou  art  a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec."
58,7,18,"For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof."
58,7,19,"For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope  did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God."
58,7,20,"And inasmuch as not without an oath  he was made priest :"
58,7,21,"(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou  art  a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)"
58,7,22,"By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament."
58,7,23,"And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:"
58,7,24,"But this  man , because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood."
58,7,25,"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."
58,7,26,"For such an high priest became us,  who is  holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;"
58,7,27,"Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself."
58,7,28,"For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law,  maketh  the Son, who is consecrated for evermore."
58,8,1,"Now of the things which we have spoken  this is  the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;"
58,8,2,"A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."
58,8,3,"For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore  it is  of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer."
58,8,4,"For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:"
58,8,5,"Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he,  that  thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount."
58,8,6,"But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises."
58,8,7,"For if that first  covenant  had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second."
58,8,8,"For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:"
58,8,9,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord."
58,8,10,"For this  is  the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:"
58,8,11,"And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest."
58,8,12,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."
58,8,13,"In that he saith, A new  covenant , he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old  is  ready to vanish away."
58,9,1,"Then verily the first  covenant  had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary."
58,9,2,"For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein  was  the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary."
58,9,3,"And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;"
58,9,4,"Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein  was  the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;"
58,9,5,"And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly."
58,9,6,"Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service  of God ."
58,9,7,"But into the second  went  the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and  for  the errors of the people:"
58,9,8,"The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:"
58,9,9,"Which  was  a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;"
58,9,10,"Which stood  only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed  on them  until the time of reformation."
58,9,11,"But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;"
58,9,12,"Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption  for us ."
58,9,13,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:"
58,9,14,"How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
58,9,15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions  that were  under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."
58,9,16,"For where a testament  is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator."
58,9,17,"For a testament  is  of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth."
58,9,18,"Whereupon neither the first  testament  was dedicated without blood."
58,9,19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,"
58,9,20,"Saying, This  is  the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you."
58,9,21,"Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry."
58,9,22,"And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission."
58,9,23,"It was  therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
58,9,24,"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,  which are  the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:"
58,9,25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;"
58,9,26,"For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself."
58,9,27,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"
58,9,28,"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation."
58,10,1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come,  and  not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect."
58,10,2,"For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins."
58,10,3,"But in those  sacrifices there is  a remembrance again  made  of sins every year."
58,10,4,"For  it is  not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins."
58,10,5,"Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:"
58,10,6,"In burnt offerings and  sacrifices  for sin thou hast had no pleasure."
58,10,7,"Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God."
58,10,8,"Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and  offering  for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure  therein ; which are offered by the law;"
58,10,9,"Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second."
58,10,10,"By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once  for all ."
58,10,11,"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:"
58,10,12,"But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;"
58,10,13,"From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool."
58,10,14,"For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified."
58,10,15,"Whereof  the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,"
58,10,16,"This  is  the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;"
58,10,17,"And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more."
58,10,18,"Now where remission of these  is, there is  no more offering for sin."
58,10,19,"Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,"
58,10,20,"By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;"
58,10,21,"And  having  an high priest over the house of God;"
58,10,22,"Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water."
58,10,23,"Let us hold fast the profession of  our  faith without wavering; (for he  is  faithful that promised;)"
58,10,24,"And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:"
58,10,25,"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some  is ; but exhorting  one another : and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching."
58,10,26,"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,"
58,10,27,"But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."
58,10,28,"He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:"
58,10,29,"Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?"
58,10,30,"For we know him that hath said, Vengeance  belongeth  unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people."
58,10,31,"It is  a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
58,10,32,"But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;"
58,10,33,"Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used."
58,10,34,"For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance."
58,10,35,"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward."
58,10,36,"For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise."
58,10,37,"For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry."
58,10,38,"Now the just shall live by faith: but if  any man  draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."
58,10,39,"But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul."
58,11,1,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
58,11,2,"For by it the elders obtained a good report."
58,11,3,"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."
58,11,4,"By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh."
58,11,5,"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God."
58,11,6,"But without faith  it is  impossible to please  him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and  that  he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
58,11,7,"By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."
58,11,8,"By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went."
58,11,9,"By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as  in  a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:"
58,11,10,"For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker  is  God."
58,11,11,"Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised."
58,11,12,"Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead,  so many  as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable."
58,11,13,"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of  them , and embraced  them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."
58,11,14,"For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country."
58,11,15,"And truly, if they had been mindful of that  country  from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned."
58,11,16,"But now they desire a better  country , that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city."
58,11,17,"By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten  son ,"
58,11,18,"Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:"
58,11,19,"Accounting that God  was  able to raise  him  up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure."
58,11,20,"By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come."
58,11,21,"By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped,  leaning  upon the top of his staff."
58,11,22,"By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones."
58,11,23,"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw  he was  a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment."
58,11,24,"By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;"
58,11,25,"Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;"
58,11,26,"Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward."
58,11,27,"By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible."
58,11,28,"Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them."
58,11,29,"By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry  land : which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned."
58,11,30,"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days."
58,11,31,"By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace."
58,11,32,"And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and  of  Barak, and  of  Samson, and  of  Jephthae;  of  David also, and Samuel, and  of  the prophets:"
58,11,33,"Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,"
58,11,34,"Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens."
58,11,35,"Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:"
58,11,36,"And others had trial of  cruel  mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:"
58,11,37,"They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;"
58,11,38,"(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and  in  mountains, and  in  dens and caves of the earth."
58,11,39,"And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:"
58,11,40,"God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."
58,12,1,"Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset  us , and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,"
58,12,2,"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of  our  faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."
58,12,3,"For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds."
58,12,4,"Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin."
58,12,5,"And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:"
58,12,6,"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."
58,12,7,"If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?"
58,12,8,"But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons."
58,12,9,"Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected  us , and we gave  them  reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?"
58,12,10,"For they verily for a few days chastened  us  after their own pleasure; but he for  our  profit, that  we  might be partakers of his holiness."
58,12,11,"Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."
58,12,12,"Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;"
58,12,13,"And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed."
58,12,14,"Follow peace with all  men , and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:"
58,12,15,"Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble  you , and thereby many be defiled;"
58,12,16,"Lest there  be  any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright."
58,12,17,"For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears."
58,12,18,"For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,"
58,12,19,"And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which  voice  they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:"
58,12,20,"(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:"
58,12,21,"And so terrible was the sight,  that  Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)"
58,12,22,"But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,"
58,12,23,"To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,"
58,12,24,"And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than  that of  Abel."
58,12,25,"See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more  shall not  we  escape , if we turn away from him that  speaketh  from heaven:"
58,12,26,"Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven."
58,12,27,"And this  word , Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain."
58,12,28,"Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:"
58,12,29,"For our God  is  a consuming fire."
58,13,1,"Let brotherly love continue."
58,13,2,"Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares."
58,13,3,"Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them;  and  them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body."
58,13,4,"Marriage  is  honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."
58,13,5,"Let your  conversation  be  without covetousness;  and be  content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."
58,13,6,"So that we may boldly say, The Lord  is  my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me."
58,13,7,"Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of  their  conversation."
58,13,8,"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever."
58,13,9,"Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For  it is  a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein."
58,13,10,"We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle."
58,13,11,"For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp."
58,13,12,"Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate."
58,13,13,"Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach."
58,13,14,"For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come."
58,13,15,"By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of  our  lips giving thanks to his name."
58,13,16,"But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."
58,13,17,"Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that  is  unprofitable for you."
58,13,18,"Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly."
58,13,19,"But I beseech  you  the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner."
58,13,20,"Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,"
58,13,21,"Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom  be  glory for ever and ever. Amen."
58,13,22,"And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words."
58,13,23,"Know ye that  our  brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you."
58,13,24,"Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you."
58,13,25,"Grace  be  with you all. Amen.   Written to the Hebrews from Italy by Timothy."
59,1,1,"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting."
59,1,2,"My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;"
59,1,3,"Knowing  this , that the trying of your faith worketh patience."
59,1,4,"But let patience have  her  perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing."
59,1,5,"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all  men  liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."
59,1,6,"But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed."
59,1,7,"For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord."
59,1,8,"A double minded man  is  unstable in all his ways."
59,1,9,"Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:"
59,1,10,"But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away."
59,1,11,"For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways."
59,1,12,"Blessed  is  the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him."
59,1,13,"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:"
59,1,14,"But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed."
59,1,15,"Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death."
59,1,16,"Do not err, my beloved brethren."
59,1,17,"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."
59,1,18,"Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures."
59,1,19,"Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:"
59,1,20,"For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God."
59,1,21,"Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls."
59,1,22,"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."
59,1,23,"For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:"
59,1,24,"For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was."
59,1,25,"But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth  therein , he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."
59,1,26,"If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion  is  vain."
59,1,27,"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,  and  to keep himself unspotted from the world."
59,2,1,"My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,  the Lord  of glory, with respect of persons."
59,2,2,"For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;"
59,2,3,"And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:"
59,2,4,"Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?"
59,2,5,"Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?"
59,2,6,"But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?"
59,2,7,"Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?"
59,2,8,"If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:"
59,2,9,"But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors."
59,2,10,"For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one  point , he is guilty of all."
59,2,11,"For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law."
59,2,12,"So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."
59,2,13,"For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment."
59,2,14,"What  doth it  profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?"
59,2,15,"If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,"
59,2,16,"And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be  ye  warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what  doth it  profit?"
59,2,17,"Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone."
59,2,18,"Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works."
59,2,19,"Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble."
59,2,20,"But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"
59,2,21,"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?"
59,2,22,"Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?"
59,2,23,"And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God."
59,2,24,"Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."
59,2,25,"Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent  them  out another way?"
59,2,26,"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
59,3,1,"My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation."
59,3,2,"For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same  is  a perfect man,  and  able also to bridle the whole body."
59,3,3,"Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body."
59,3,4,"Behold also the ships, which though  they be  so great, and  are  driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth."
59,3,5,"Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!"
59,3,6,"And the tongue  is  a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell."
59,3,7,"For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:"
59,3,8,"But the tongue can no man tame;  it is  an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."
59,3,9,"Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God."
59,3,10,"Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be."
59,3,11,"Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet  water  and bitter?"
59,3,12,"Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so  can  no fountain both yield salt water and fresh."
59,3,13,"Who  is  a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom."
59,3,14,"But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth."
59,3,15,"This wisdom descendeth not from above, but  is  earthly, sensual, devilish."
59,3,16,"For where envying and strife  is , there  is  confusion and every evil work."
59,3,17,"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle,  and  easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy."
59,3,18,"And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace."
59,4,1,"From whence  come  wars and fightings among you?  come they  not hence,  even  of your lusts that war in your members?"
59,4,2,"Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not."
59,4,3,"Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume  it  upon your lusts."
59,4,4,"Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God."
59,4,5,"Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?"
59,4,6,"But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble."
59,4,7,"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
59,4,8,"Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse  your  hands,  ye  sinners; and purify  your  hearts,  ye  double minded."
59,4,9,"Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and  your  joy to heaviness."
59,4,10,"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up."
59,4,11,"Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of  his  brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge."
59,4,12,"There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?"
59,4,13,"Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:"
59,4,14,"Whereas ye know not what  shall be  on the morrow. For what  is  your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away."
59,4,15,"For that ye  ought  to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that."
59,4,16,"But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil."
59,4,17,"Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth  it  not, to him it is sin."
59,5,1,"Go to now,  ye  rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon  you ."
59,5,2,"Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten."
59,5,3,"Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days."
59,5,4,"Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth."
59,5,5,"Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter."
59,5,6,"Ye have condemned  and  killed the just;  and  he doth not resist you."
59,5,7,"Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain."
59,5,8,"Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh."
59,5,9,"Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door."
59,5,10,"Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience."
59,5,11,"Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy."
59,5,12,"But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and  your  nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation."
59,5,13,"Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms."
59,5,14,"Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:"
59,5,15,"And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."
59,5,16,"Confess  your  faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much."
59,5,17,"Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months."
59,5,18,"And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit."
59,5,19,"Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;"
59,5,20,"Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins."
60,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
60,1,2,"Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied."
60,1,3,"Blessed  be  the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"
60,1,4,"To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,"
60,1,5,"Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."
60,1,6,"Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:"
60,1,7,"That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:"
60,1,8,"Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see  him  not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:"
60,1,9,"Receiving the end of your faith,  even  the salvation of  your  souls."
60,1,10,"Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace  that should come  unto you:"
60,1,11,"Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow."
60,1,12,"Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into."
60,1,13,"Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;"
60,1,14,"As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:"
60,1,15,"But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;"
60,1,16,"Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy."
60,1,17,"And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning  here  in fear:"
60,1,18,"Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things,  as  silver and gold, from your vain conversation  received  by tradition from your fathers;"
60,1,19,"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:"
60,1,20,"Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,"
60,1,21,"Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God."
60,1,22,"Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren,  see that ye  love one another with a pure heart fervently:"
60,1,23,"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever."
60,1,24,"For all flesh  is  as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:"
60,1,25,"But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you."
60,2,1,"Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,"
60,2,2,"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:"
60,2,3,"If so be ye have tasted that the Lord  is  gracious."
60,2,4,"To whom coming,  as unto  a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God,  and  precious,"
60,2,5,"Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."
60,2,6,"Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded."
60,2,7,"Unto you therefore which believe  he is  precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,"
60,2,8,"And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence,  even to them  which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed."
60,2,9,"But ye  are  a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:"
60,2,10,"Which in time past  were  not a people, but  are  now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy."
60,2,11,"Dearly beloved, I beseech  you  as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;"
60,2,12,"Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by  your  good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation."
60,2,13,"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;"
60,2,14,"Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well."
60,2,15,"For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:"
60,2,16,"As free, and not using  your  liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God."
60,2,17,"Honour all  men . Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king."
60,2,18,"Servants,  be  subject to  your  masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward."
60,2,19,"For this  is  thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully."
60,2,20,"For what glory  is it , if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer  for it , ye take it patiently, this  is  acceptable with God."
60,2,21,"For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:"
60,2,22,"Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:"
60,2,23,"Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed  himself  to him that judgeth righteously:"
60,2,24,"Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed."
60,2,25,"For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls."
60,3,1,"Likewise, ye wives,  be  in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;"
60,3,2,"While they behold your chaste conversation  coupled  with fear."
60,3,3,"Whose adorning let it not be that outward  adorning  of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;"
60,3,4,"But  let it be  the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible,  even the ornament  of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price."
60,3,5,"For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:"
60,3,6,"Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement."
60,3,7,"Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with  them  according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered."
60,3,8,"Finally,  be ye  all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren,  be  pitiful,  be  courteous:"
60,3,9,"Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing."
60,3,10,"For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:"
60,3,11,"Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it."
60,3,12,"For the eyes of the Lord  are  over the righteous, and his ears  are open  unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord  is  against them that do evil."
60,3,13,"And who  is  he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?"
60,3,14,"But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy  are ye : and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;"
60,3,15,"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and  be  ready always to  give  an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:"
60,3,16,"Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ."
60,3,17,"For  it is  better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing."
60,3,18,"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:"
60,3,19,"By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;"
60,3,20,"Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water."
60,3,21,"The like figure whereunto  even  baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:"
60,3,22,"Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him."
60,4,1,"Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;"
60,4,2,"That he no longer should live the rest of  his  time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God."
60,4,3,"For the time past of  our  life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:"
60,4,4,"Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with  them  to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of  you :"
60,4,5,"Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead."
60,4,6,"For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."
60,4,7,"But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer."
60,4,8,"And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins."
60,4,9,"Use hospitality one to another without grudging."
60,4,10,"As every man hath received the gift,  even so  minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."
60,4,11,"If any man speak,  let him speak  as the oracles of God; if any man minister,  let him do it  as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."
60,4,12,"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:"
60,4,13,"But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy."
60,4,14,"If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy  are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified."
60,4,15,"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or  as  a thief, or  as  an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters."
60,4,16,"Yet if  any man suffer  as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf."
60,4,17,"For the time  is come  that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if  it  first  begin  at us, what shall the end  be  of them that obey not the gospel of God?"
60,4,18,"And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"
60,4,19,"Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls  to him  in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator."
60,5,1,"The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:"
60,5,2,"Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight  thereof , not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;"
60,5,3,"Neither as being lords over  God’s  heritage, but being ensamples to the flock."
60,5,4,"And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away."
60,5,5,"Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all  of you  be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble."
60,5,6,"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:"
60,5,7,"Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you."
60,5,8,"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:"
60,5,9,"Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world."
60,5,10,"But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle  you ."
60,5,11,"To him  be  glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."
60,5,12,"By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand."
60,5,13,"The  church that is  at Babylon, elected together with  you , saluteth you; and  so doth  Marcus my son."
60,5,14,"Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace  be  with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen."
61,1,1,"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:"
61,1,2,"Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,"
61,1,3,"According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that  pertain  unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:"
61,1,4,"Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
61,1,5,"And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;"
61,1,6,"And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;"
61,1,7,"And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity."
61,1,8,"For if these things be in you, and abound, they make  you that ye shall  neither  be  barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
61,1,9,"But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins."
61,1,10,"Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:"
61,1,11,"For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
61,1,12,"Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know  them , and be established in the present truth."
61,1,13,"Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting  you  in remembrance;"
61,1,14,"Knowing that shortly I must put off  this  my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me."
61,1,15,"Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance."
61,1,16,"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
61,1,17,"For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
61,1,18,"And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount."
61,1,19,"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:"
61,1,20,"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation."
61,1,21,"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake  as they were  moved by the Holy Ghost."
61,2,1,"But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction."
61,2,2,"And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of."
61,2,3,"And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not."
61,2,4,"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast  them  down to hell, and delivered  them  into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;"
61,2,5,"And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth  person , a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;"
61,2,6,"And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned  them  with an overthrow, making  them  an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;"
61,2,7,"And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:"
61,2,8,"(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed  his  righteous soul from day to day with  their  unlawful deeds;)"
61,2,9,"The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:"
61,2,10,"But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous  are they , selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities."
61,2,11,"Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord."
61,2,12,"But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;"
61,2,13,"And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness,  as  they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots  they are  and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;"
61,2,14,"Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:"
61,2,15,"Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam  the son  of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;"
61,2,16,"But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s voice forbad the madness of the prophet."
61,2,17,"These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever."
61,2,18,"For when they speak great swelling  words  of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh,  through much  wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error."
61,2,19,"While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage."
61,2,20,"For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning."
61,2,21,"For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known  it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them."
61,2,22,"But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog  is  turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."
61,3,1,"This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in  both  which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:"
61,3,2,"That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:"
61,3,3,"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,"
61,3,4,"And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as  they were  from the beginning of the creation."
61,3,5,"For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:"
61,3,6,"Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:"
61,3,7,"But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."
61,3,8,"But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day  is  with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
61,3,9,"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
61,3,10,"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up."
61,3,11,"Seeing  then  that  all these things shall be dissolved, what manner  of persons  ought ye to be in  all  holy conversation and godliness,"
61,3,12,"Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?"
61,3,13,"Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."
61,3,14,"Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless."
61,3,15,"And account  that  the longsuffering of our Lord  is  salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;"
61,3,16,"As also in all  his  epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as  they do  also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction."
61,3,17,"Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know  these things  before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness."
61,3,18,"But grow in grace, and  in  the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him  be  glory both now and for ever. Amen."
62,1,1,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;"
62,1,2,"(For the life was manifested, and we have seen  it , and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)"
62,1,3,"That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship  is  with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."
62,1,4,"And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."
62,1,5,"This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
62,1,6,"If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:"
62,1,7,"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin."
62,1,8,"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
62,1,9,"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us  our  sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
62,1,10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."
62,2,1,"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:"
62,2,2,"And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for  the sins of  the whole world."
62,2,3,"And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments."
62,2,4,"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
62,2,5,"But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him."
62,2,6,"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked."
62,2,7,"Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning."
62,2,8,"Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth."
62,2,9,"He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now."
62,2,10,"He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him."
62,2,11,"But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes."
62,2,12,"I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake."
62,2,13,"I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him  that is  from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father."
62,2,14,"I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him  that is  from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one."
62,2,15,"Love not the world, neither the things  that are  in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
62,2,16,"For all that  is  in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world."
62,2,17,"And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."
62,2,18,"Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time."
62,2,19,"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would  no doubt  have continued with us: but  they went out , that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."
62,2,20,"But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things."
62,2,21,"I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth."
62,2,22,"Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son."
62,2,23,"Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father:  (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also ."
62,2,24,"Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father."
62,2,25,"And this is the promise that he hath promised us,  even  eternal life."
62,2,26,"These  things  have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you."
62,2,27,"But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him."
62,2,28,"And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming."
62,2,29,"If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him."
62,3,1,"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not."
62,3,2,"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."
62,3,3,"And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."
62,3,4,"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law."
62,3,5,"And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin."
62,3,6,"Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him."
62,3,7,"Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous."
62,3,8,"He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil."
62,3,9,"Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God."
62,3,10,"In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother."
62,3,11,"For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another."
62,3,12,"Not as Cain,  who  was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous."
62,3,13,"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you."
62,3,14,"We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not  his  brother abideth in death."
62,3,15,"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him."
62,3,16,"Hereby perceive we the love  of God , because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down  our  lives for the brethren."
62,3,17,"But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels  of compassion  from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?"
62,3,18,"My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth."
62,3,19,"And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him."
62,3,20,"For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things."
62,3,21,"Beloved, if our heart condemn us not,  then  have we confidence toward God."
62,3,22,"And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight."
62,3,23,"And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment."
62,3,24,"And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us."
62,4,1,"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world."
62,4,2,"Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:"
62,4,3,"And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that  spirit  of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world."
62,4,4,"Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."
62,4,5,"They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them."
62,4,6,"We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error."
62,4,7,"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God."
62,4,8,"He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love."
62,4,9,"In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him."
62,4,10,"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son  to be  the propitiation for our sins."
62,4,11,"Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."
62,4,12,"No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us."
62,4,13,"Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit."
62,4,14,"And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son  to be  the Saviour of the world."
62,4,15,"Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God."
62,4,16,"And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him."
62,4,17,"Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world."
62,4,18,"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love."
62,4,19,"We love him, because he first loved us."
62,4,20,"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?"
62,4,21,"And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also."
62,5,1,"Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him."
62,5,2,"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments."
62,5,3,"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."
62,5,4,"For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world,  even  our faith."
62,5,5,"Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"
62,5,6,"This is he that came by water and blood,  even  Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth."
62,5,7,"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one."
62,5,8,"And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one."
62,5,9,"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son."
62,5,10,"He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son."
62,5,11,"And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son."
62,5,12,"He that hath the Son hath life;  and  he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."
62,5,13,"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God."
62,5,14,"And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:"
62,5,15,"And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him."
62,5,16,"If any man see his brother sin a sin  which is  not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it."
62,5,17,"All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death."
62,5,18,"We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not."
62,5,19,"And  we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness."
62,5,20,"And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true,  even  in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life."
62,5,21,"Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen."
63,1,1,"The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;"
63,1,2,"For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever."
63,1,3,"Grace be with you, mercy,  and  peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
63,1,4,"I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father."
63,1,5,"And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another."
63,1,6,"And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it."
63,1,7,"For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist."
63,1,8,"Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward."
63,1,9,"Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son."
63,1,10,"If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into  your  house, neither bid him God speed:"
63,1,11,"For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds."
63,1,12,"Having many things to write unto you, I would not  write  with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full."
63,1,13,"The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen."
64,1,1,"The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth."
64,1,2,"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth."
64,1,3,"For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth."
64,1,4,"I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth."
64,1,5,"Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;"
64,1,6,"Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:"
64,1,7,"Because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles."
64,1,8,"We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth."
64,1,9,"I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not."
64,1,10,"Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth  them  out of the church."
64,1,11,"Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God."
64,1,12,"Demetrius hath good report of all  men , and of the truth itself: yea, and we  also  bear record; and ye know that our record is true."
64,1,13,"I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:"
64,1,14,"But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace  be  to thee.  Our  friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name."
65,1,1,"Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ,  and  called:"
65,1,2,"Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied."
65,1,3,"Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort  you  that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints."
65,1,4,"For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ."
65,1,5,"I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not."
65,1,6,"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."
65,1,7,"Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."
65,1,8,"Likewise also these  filthy  dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities."
65,1,9,"Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee."
65,1,10,"But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves."
65,1,11,"Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core."
65,1,12,"These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds  they are  without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;"
65,1,13,"Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever."
65,1,14,"And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,"
65,1,15,"To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard  speeches  which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
65,1,16,"These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling  words , having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage."
65,1,17,"But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
65,1,18,"How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts."
65,1,19,"These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit."
65,1,20,"But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,"
65,1,21,"Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life."
65,1,22,"And of some have compassion, making a difference:"
65,1,23,"And others save with fear, pulling  them  out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh."
65,1,24,"Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present  you  faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,"
65,1,25,"To the only wise God our Saviour,  be  glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen."
66,1,1,"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified  it  by his angel unto his servant John:"
66,1,2,"Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw."
66,1,3,"Blessed  is  he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time  is  at hand."
66,1,4,"John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace  be  unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;"
66,1,5,"And from Jesus Christ,  who is  the faithful witness,  and  the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,"
66,1,6,"And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him  be  glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen."
66,1,7,"Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they  also  which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen."
66,1,8,"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty."
66,1,9,"I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ."
66,1,10,"I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,"
66,1,11,"Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send  it  unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea."
66,1,12,"And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;"
66,1,13,"And in the midst of the seven candlesticks  one  like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle."
66,1,14,"His head and  his  hairs  were  white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes  were  as a flame of fire;"
66,1,15,"And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters."
66,1,16,"And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance  was  as the sun shineth in his strength."
66,1,17,"And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:"
66,1,18,"I am  he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death."
66,1,19,"Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;"
66,1,20,"The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches."
66,2,1,"Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;"
66,2,2,"I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:"
66,2,3,"And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted."
66,2,4,"Nevertheless I have  somewhat  against thee, because thou hast left thy first love."
66,2,5,"Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent."
66,2,6,"But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
66,2,7,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God."
66,2,8,"And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;"
66,2,9,"I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and  I know  the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but  are  the synagogue of Satan."
66,2,10,"Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast  some  of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."
66,2,11,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death."
66,2,12,"And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;"
66,2,13,"I know thy works, and where thou dwellest,  even  where Satan’s seat  is : and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas  was  my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth."
66,2,14,"But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication."
66,2,15,"So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate."
66,2,16,"Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth."
66,2,17,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth  it ."
66,2,18,"And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet  are  like fine brass;"
66,2,19,"I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last  to be  more than the first."
66,2,20,"Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols."
66,2,21,"And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not."
66,2,22,"Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds."
66,2,23,"And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works."
66,2,24,"But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden."
66,2,25,"But that which ye have  already  hold fast till I come."
66,2,26,"And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:"
66,2,27,"And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father."
66,2,28,"And I will give him the morning star."
66,2,29,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."
66,3,1,"And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead."
66,3,2,"Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God."
66,3,3,"Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee."
66,3,4,"Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy."
66,3,5,"He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels."
66,3,6,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."
66,3,7,"And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;"
66,3,8,"I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name."
66,3,9,"Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee."
66,3,10,"Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."
66,3,11,"Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown."
66,3,12,"Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God,  which is  new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and  I will write upon him  my new name."
66,3,13,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."
66,3,14,"And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;"
66,3,15,"I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot."
66,3,16,"So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth."
66,3,17,"Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:"
66,3,18,"I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and  that  the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see."
66,3,19,"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent."
66,3,20,"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me."
66,3,21,"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne."
66,3,22,"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."
66,4,1,"After this I looked, and, behold, a door  was  opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard  was  as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter."
66,4,2,"And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and  one  sat on the throne."
66,4,3,"And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and  there was  a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald."
66,4,4,"And round about the throne  were  four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold."
66,4,5,"And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and  there were  seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God."
66,4,6,"And before the throne  there was  a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne,  were  four beasts full of eyes before and behind."
66,4,7,"And the first beast  was  like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast  was  like a flying eagle."
66,4,8,"And the four beasts had each of them six wings about  him ; and  they were  full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come."
66,4,9,"And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,"
66,4,10,"The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,"
66,4,11,"Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created."
66,5,1,"And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals."
66,5,2,"And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?"
66,5,3,"And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon."
66,5,4,"And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon."
66,5,5,"And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof."
66,5,6,"And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth."
66,5,7,"And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne."
66,5,8,"And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four  and  twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints."
66,5,9,"And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;"
66,5,10,"And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth."
66,5,11,"And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;"
66,5,12,"Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing."
66,5,13,"And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power,  be  unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever."
66,5,14,"And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four  and  twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever."
66,6,1,"And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see."
66,6,2,"And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer."
66,6,3,"And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see."
66,6,4,"And there went out another horse  that was  red: and  power  was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword."
66,6,5,"And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand."
66,6,6,"And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and  see  thou hurt not the oil and the wine."
66,6,7,"And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see."
66,6,8,"And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."
66,6,9,"And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:"
66,6,10,"And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"
66,6,11,"And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they  were , should be fulfilled."
66,6,12,"And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;"
66,6,13,"And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind."
66,6,14,"And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
66,6,15,"And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;"
66,6,16,"And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:"
66,6,17,"For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?"
66,7,1,"And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree."
66,7,2,"And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,"
66,7,3,"Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads."
66,7,4,"And I heard the number of them which were sealed:  and there were  sealed an hundred  and  forty  and  four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel."
66,7,5,"Of the tribe of Juda  were  sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben  were  sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad  were  sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,6,"Of the tribe of Aser  were  sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nepthalim  were  sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses  were  sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,7,"Of the tribe of Simeon  were  sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi  were  sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar  were  sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,8,"Of the tribe of Zabulon  were  sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph  were  sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin  were  sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,9,"After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;"
66,7,10,"And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb."
66,7,11,"And all the angels stood round about the throne, and  about  the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,"
66,7,12,"Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might,  be  unto our God for ever and ever. Amen."
66,7,13,"And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?"
66,7,14,"And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
66,7,15,"Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them."
66,7,16,"They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat."
66,7,17,"For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."
66,8,1,"And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour."
66,8,2,"And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets."
66,8,3,"And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer  it  with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne."
66,8,4,"And the smoke of the incense,  which came  with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand."
66,8,5,"And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast  it  into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake."
66,8,6,"And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound."
66,8,7,"The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up."
66,8,8,"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;"
66,8,9,"And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed."
66,8,10,"And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;"
66,8,11,"And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter."
66,8,12,"And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise."
66,8,13,"And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!"
66,9,1,"And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit."
66,9,2,"And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit."
66,9,3,"And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power."
66,9,4,"And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads."
66,9,5,"And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment  was  as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man."
66,9,6,"And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them."
66,9,7,"And the shapes of the locusts  were  like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads  were  as it were crowns like gold, and their faces  were  as the faces of men."
66,9,8,"And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as  the teeth  of lions."
66,9,9,"And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings  was  as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle."
66,9,10,"And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power  was  to hurt men five months."
66,9,11,"And they had a king over them,  which is  the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue  is  Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath  his  name Apollyon."
66,9,12,"One woe is past;  and , behold, there come two woes more hereafter."
66,9,13,"And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,"
66,9,14,"Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates."
66,9,15,"And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men."
66,9,16,"And the number of the army of the horsemen  were  two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them."
66,9,17,"And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses  were  as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone."
66,9,18,"By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths."
66,9,19,"For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails  were  like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt."
66,9,20,"And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:"
66,9,21,"Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts."
66,10,1,"And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow  was  upon his head, and his face  was  as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:"
66,10,2,"And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and  his  left  foot  on the earth,"
66,10,3,"And cried with a loud voice, as  when  a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices."
66,10,4,"And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not."
66,10,5,"And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,"
66,10,6,"And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:"
66,10,7,"But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets."
66,10,8,"And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go  and  take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth."
66,10,9,"And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take  it , and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey."
66,10,10,"And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter."
66,10,11,"And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings."
66,11,1,"And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein."
66,11,2,"But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty  and  two months."
66,11,3,"And I will give  power  unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred  and  threescore days, clothed in sackcloth."
66,11,4,"These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth."
66,11,5,"And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed."
66,11,6,"These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will."
66,11,7,"And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them."
66,11,8,"And their dead bodies  shall lie  in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified."
66,11,9,"And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves."
66,11,10,"And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth."
66,11,11,"And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them."
66,11,12,"And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them."
66,11,13,"And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven."
66,11,14,"The second woe is past;  and , behold, the third woe cometh quickly."
66,11,15,"And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become  the kingdoms  of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever."
66,11,16,"And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,"
66,11,17,"Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned."
66,11,18,"And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth."
66,11,19,"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail."
66,12,1,"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:"
66,12,2,"And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered."
66,12,3,"And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads."
66,12,4,"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born."
66,12,5,"And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and  to  his throne."
66,12,6,"And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred  and  threescore days."
66,12,7,"And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,"
66,12,8,"And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven."
66,12,9,"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."
66,12,10,"And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night."
66,12,11,"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death."
66,12,12,"Therefore rejoice,  ye  heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time."
66,12,13,"And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man  child ."
66,12,14,"And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent."
66,12,15,"And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood."
66,12,16,"And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth."
66,12,17,"And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."
66,13,1,"And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy."
66,13,2,"And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as  the feet  of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority."
66,13,3,"And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast."
66,13,4,"And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who  is  like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?"
66,13,5,"And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty  and  two months."
66,13,6,"And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven."
66,13,7,"And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations."
66,13,8,"And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
66,13,9,"If any man have an ear, let him hear."
66,13,10,"He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints."
66,13,11,"And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon."
66,13,12,"And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed."
66,13,13,"And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,"
66,13,14,"And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by  the means of  those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live."
66,13,15,"And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."
66,13,16,"And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:"
66,13,17,"And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
66,13,18,"Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number  is  Six hundred threescore  and  six."
66,14,1,"And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty  and  four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads."
66,14,2,"And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:"
66,14,3,"And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred  and  forty  and  four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth."
66,14,4,"These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men,  being  the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb."
66,14,5,"And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God."
66,14,6,"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,"
66,14,7,"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."
66,14,8,"And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."
66,14,9,"And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive  his  mark in his forehead, or in his hand,"
66,14,10,"The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:"
66,14,11,"And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name."
66,14,12,"Here is the patience of the saints: here  are  they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
66,14,13,"And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed  are  the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them."
66,14,14,"And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud  one  sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle."
66,14,15,"And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe."
66,14,16,"And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped."
66,14,17,"And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle."
66,14,18,"And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe."
66,14,19,"And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast  it  into the great winepress of the wrath of God."
66,14,20,"And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand  and  six hundred furlongs."
66,15,1,"And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God."
66,15,2,"And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark,  and  over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God."
66,15,3,"And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous  are  thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true  are  thy ways, thou King of saints."
66,15,4,"Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for  thou  only  art  holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest."
66,15,5,"And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:"
66,15,6,"And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles."
66,15,7,"And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever."
66,15,8,"And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled."
66,16,1,"And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth."
66,16,2,"And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and  upon  them which worshipped his image."
66,16,3,"And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead  man : and every living soul died in the sea."
66,16,4,"And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood."
66,16,5,"And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus."
66,16,6,"For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy."
66,16,7,"And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous  are  thy judgments."
66,16,8,"And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire."
66,16,9,"And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory."
66,16,10,"And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,"
66,16,11,"And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds."
66,16,12,"And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared."
66,16,13,"And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs  come  out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet."
66,16,14,"For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles,  which  go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty."
66,16,15,"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed  is  he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame."
66,16,16,"And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon."
66,16,17,"And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done."
66,16,18,"And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake,  and  so great."
66,16,19,"And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath."
66,16,20,"And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found."
66,16,21,"And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven,  every stone  about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great."
66,17,1,"And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:"
66,17,2,"With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication."
66,17,3,"So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns."
66,17,4,"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:"
66,17,5,"And upon her forehead  was  a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
66,17,6,"And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration."
66,17,7,"And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns."
66,17,8,"The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is."
66,17,9,"And here  is  the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth."
66,17,10,"And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is,  and  the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space."
66,17,11,"And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition."
66,17,12,"And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast."
66,17,13,"These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast."
66,17,14,"These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him  are  called, and chosen, and faithful."
66,17,15,"And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues."
66,17,16,"And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire."
66,17,17,"For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled."
66,17,18,"And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth."
66,18,1,"And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory."
66,18,2,"And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird."
66,18,3,"For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies."
66,18,4,"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."
66,18,5,"For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities."
66,18,6,"Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double."
66,18,7,"How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow."
66,18,8,"Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong  is  the Lord God who judgeth her."
66,18,9,"And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,"
66,18,10,"Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come."
66,18,11,"And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:"
66,18,12,"The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,"
66,18,13,"And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men."
66,18,14,"And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all."
66,18,15,"The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,"
66,18,16,"And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!"
66,18,17,"For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,"
66,18,18,"And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What  city is  like unto this great city!"
66,18,19,"And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate."
66,18,20,"Rejoice over her,  thou  heaven, and  ye  holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her."
66,18,21,"And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast  it  into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all."
66,18,22,"And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft  he be , shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;"
66,18,23,"And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived."
66,18,24,"And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth."
66,19,1,"And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:"
66,19,2,"For true and righteous  are  his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand."
66,19,3,"And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever."
66,19,4,"And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia."
66,19,5,"And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great."
66,19,6,"And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth."
66,19,7,"Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready."
66,19,8,"And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints."
66,19,9,"And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed  are  they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God."
66,19,10,"And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See  thou do it  not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
66,19,11,"And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him  was  called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war."
66,19,12,"His eyes  were  as a flame of fire, and on his head  were  many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself."
66,19,13,"And he  was  clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God."
66,19,14,"And the armies  which were  in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean."
66,19,15,"And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God."
66,19,16,"And he hath on  his  vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."
66,19,17,"And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;"
66,19,18,"That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all  men, both  free and bond, both small and great."
66,19,19,"And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army."
66,19,20,"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."
66,19,21,"And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which  sword  proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh."
66,20,1,"And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand."
66,20,2,"And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,"
66,20,3,"And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season."
66,20,4,"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and  I saw  the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received  his  mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years."
66,20,5,"But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This  is  the first resurrection."
66,20,6,"Blessed and holy  is  he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years."
66,20,7,"And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,"
66,20,8,"And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom  is  as the sand of the sea."
66,20,9,"And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."
66,20,10,"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet  are , and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
66,20,11,"And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them."
66,20,12,"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is  the book  of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works."
66,20,13,"And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works."
66,20,14,"And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."
66,20,15,"And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."
66,21,1,"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea."
66,21,2,"And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."
66,21,3,"And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God  is  with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them,  and be  their God."
66,21,4,"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."
66,21,5,"And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful."
66,21,6,"And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely."
66,21,7,"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son."
66,21,8,"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."
66,21,9,"And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife."
66,21,10,"And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,"
66,21,11,"Having the glory of God: and her light  was  like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;"
66,21,12,"And had a wall great and high,  and  had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are  the names  of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:"
66,21,13,"On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates."
66,21,14,"And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
66,21,15,"And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof."
66,21,16,"And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal."
66,21,17,"And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred  and  forty  and  four cubits,  according to  the measure of a man, that is, of the angel."
66,21,18,"And the building of the wall of it was  of  jasper: and the city  was  pure gold, like unto clear glass."
66,21,19,"And the foundations of the wall of the city  were  garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation  was  jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;"
66,21,20,"The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst."
66,21,21,"And the twelve gates  were  twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city  was  pure gold, as it were transparent glass."
66,21,22,"And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it."
66,21,23,"And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb  is  the light thereof."
66,21,24,"And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it."
66,21,25,"And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there."
66,21,26,"And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it."
66,21,27,"And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither  whatsoever  worketh abomination, or  maketh  a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life."
66,22,1,"And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb."
66,22,2,"In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river,  was there  the tree of life, which bare twelve  manner of  fruits,  and  yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree  were  for the healing of the nations."
66,22,3,"And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:"
66,22,4,"And they shall see his face; and his name  shall be  in their foreheads."
66,22,5,"And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever."
66,22,6,"And he said unto me, These sayings  are  faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done."
66,22,7,"Behold, I come quickly: blessed  is  he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book."
66,22,8,"And I John saw these things, and heard  them . And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things."
66,22,9,"Then saith he unto me, See  thou do it  not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God."
66,22,10,"And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand."
66,22,11,"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still."
66,22,12,"And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward  is  with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."
66,22,13,"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last."
66,22,14,"Blessed  are  they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."
66,22,15,"For without  are  dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie."
66,22,16,"I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David,  and  the bright and morning star."
66,22,17,"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."
66,22,18,"For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:"
66,22,19,"And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and  from  the things which are written in this book."
66,22,20,"He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."
66,22,21,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ  be  with you all. Amen."
