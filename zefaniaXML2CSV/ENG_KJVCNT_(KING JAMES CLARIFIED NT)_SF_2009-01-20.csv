40,1,1,"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
40,1,2,"Abraham begot Isaac; and Isaac begot Jacob; and Jacob begot Judas and his brothers;"
40,1,3,"And Judas begot Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begot Esrom; and Esrom begot Aram;"
40,1,4,"And Aram begot Aminadab; and Aminadab begot Naasson; and Naasson begot Salmon;"
40,1,5,"And Salmon begot Booz of Rachab; and Booz begot Obed of Ruth; and Obed begot Jesse;"
40,1,6,"And Jesse begot David the king; and David the king begot Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;"
40,1,7,"And Solomon begot Roboam; and Roboam begot Abia; and Abia begot Asa;"
40,1,8,"And Asa begot Josaphat; and Josaphat begot Joram; and Joram begot Ozias;"
40,1,9,"And Ozias begot Joatham; and Joatham begot Achaz; and Achaz begot Ezekias;"
40,1,10,"And Ezekias begot Manasses; and Manasses begot Amon; and Amon begot Josias;"
40,1,11,"And Josias begot Jechonias and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:"
40,1,12,"And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begot Salathiel; and Salathiel begot Zorobabel;"
40,1,13,"And Zorobabel begot Abiud; and Abiud begot Eliakim; and Eliakim begot Azor;"
40,1,14,"And Azor begot Sadoc; and Sadoc begot Achim; and Achim begot Eliud;"
40,1,15,"And Eliud begot Eleazar; and Eleazar begot Matthan; and Matthan begot Jacob;"
40,1,16,"And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."
40,1,17,"So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations."
40,1,18,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit."
40,1,19,"Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly."
40,1,20,"But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, you son of David, fear not to take unto you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
40,1,21,"And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins."
40,1,22,"Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,"
40,1,23,"Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us."
40,1,24,"Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:"
40,1,25,"And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS."
40,2,1,"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,"
40,2,2,"Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him."
40,2,3,"When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him."
40,2,4,"And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born."
40,2,5,"And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,"
40,2,6,"And you Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, are not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of you shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel."
40,2,7,"Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared."
40,2,8,"And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also."
40,2,9,"When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was."
40,2,10,"When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy."
40,2,11,"And when they had come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh."
40,2,12,"And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way."
40,2,13,"And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be you there until I bring you word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
40,2,14,"When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:"
40,2,15,"And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son."
40,2,16,"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders of it, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men."
40,2,17,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,"
40,2,18,"In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not."
40,2,19,"But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,"
40,2,20,"Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life."
40,2,21,"And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel."
40,2,22,"But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go to there: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:"
40,2,23,"And he came and dwelled in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene."
40,3,1,"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,"
40,3,2,"And saying, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
40,3,3,"For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
40,3,4,"And the same John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey."
40,3,5,"Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about the Jordan,"
40,3,6,"And were baptized of him in the Jordan, confessing their sins."
40,3,7,"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
40,3,8,"Bring forth therefore fruits fit for repentance:"
40,3,9,"And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham."
40,3,10,"And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
40,3,11,"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with fire:"
40,3,12,"Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
40,3,13,"Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him."
40,3,14,"But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and you come to me?"
40,3,15,"And Jesus answering said unto him,"
40,3,16,"And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up directly out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:"
40,3,17,"And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
40,4,1,"Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil."
40,4,2,"And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward hungry."
40,4,3,"And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread."
40,4,4,"But he answered and said,"
40,4,5,"Then the devil takes him up into the holy city, and sets him on a pinnacle of the temple,"
40,4,6,"And says unto him, If you be the Son of God, cast yourself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning you: and in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone."
40,4,7,"Jesus said unto him,"
40,4,8,"Again, the devil takes him up into an exceedingly high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;"
40,4,9,"And says unto him, All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me."
40,4,10,"Then says Jesus unto him,"
40,4,11,"Then the devil left him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him."
40,4,12,"Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;"
40,4,13,"And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:"
40,4,14,"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,"
40,4,15,"The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;"
40,4,16,"The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up."
40,4,17,"From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say,"
40,4,18,"And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers."
40,4,19,"And he says unto them,"
40,4,20,"And they directly left their nets, and followed him."
40,4,21,"And going on from there, he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them."
40,4,22,"And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him."
40,4,23,"And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people."
40,4,24,"And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with different diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were insane, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them."
40,4,25,"And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond the Jordan."
40,5,1,"And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:"

40,26,71,"And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth."
40,26,72,"And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man."
40,26,73,"And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them; for your speech betrays you."

40,26,75,"And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crows, you shall deny me three times. And he went out, and wept bitterly."
40,27,1,"When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:"
40,27,2,"And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor."
40,27,3,"Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,"
40,27,4,"Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see you to that."
40,27,5,"And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself."
40,27,6,"And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."
40,27,7,"And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in."
40,27,8,"Therefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day."
40,27,9,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;"
40,27,10,"And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me."
40,27,11,"And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him,"
40,27,12,"And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing."
40,27,13,"Then said Pilate unto him, Do you hear not how many things they witness against you?"
40,27,14,"And he answered him never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly."
40,27,15,"Now at that feast the governor was accustomed to release unto the people a prisoner, whomever they desired."
40,27,16,"And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas."
40,27,17,"Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom do you will that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
40,27,18,"For he knew that because of envy they had delivered him."
40,27,19,"When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Do nothing to that righteous man: for I have endured many things this day in a dream because of him."
40,27,20,"But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus."
40,27,21,"The governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two do you will that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas."
40,27,22,"Pilate says unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified."
40,27,23,"And the governor said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified."
40,27,24,"When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see you to it."
40,27,25,"Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children."
40,27,26,"Then he released Barabbas unto them: and after Jesus was whipped, he delivered him to be crucified."
40,27,27,"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers."
40,27,28,"And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe."
40,27,29,"And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!"
40,27,30,"And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head."
40,27,31,"And after they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own clothing on him, and led him away to crucify him."
40,27,32,"And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross."
40,27,33,"And when they had come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,"
40,27,34,"They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted of it, he would not drink."
40,27,35,"And they crucified him, and divided his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They divided my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots."
40,27,36,"And sitting down they watched him there;"
40,27,37,"And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
40,27,38,"Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left."
40,27,39,"And they that passed by reviled him, shook their heads,"
40,27,40,"And saying, You that destroys the temple, and builds it in three days, save yourself. If you be the Son of God, come down from the cross."
40,27,41,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,"
40,27,42,"He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him."
40,27,43,"He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God."
40,27,44,"The thieves also, which were crucified with him, reproached him the same way."
40,27,45,"Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour."
40,27,46,"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,"
40,27,47,"Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calls for Elijah."
40,27,48,"And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink."
40,27,49,"The rest said, Let it be, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."
40,27,50,"Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost."
40,27,51,"And, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks tore;"
40,27,52,"And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,"
40,27,53,"And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many."
40,27,54,"Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God."
40,27,55,"And many women were there beholding far off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:"
40,27,56,"Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children."
40,27,57,"When the evening was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:"
40,27,58,"He went to Pilate, and requested the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered."
40,27,59,"And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"
40,27,60,"And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher, and departed."
40,27,61,"And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulcher."
40,27,62,"Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,"
40,27,63,"Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again."
40,27,64,"Command therefore that the sepulcher be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first."
40,27,65,"Pilate said unto them, You have a watch: go your way, make it as secure as you can."
40,27,66,"So they went, and made the sepulcher secure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch."
40,28,1,"In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher."
40,28,2,"And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it."
40,28,3,"His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow:"
40,28,4,"And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men."
40,28,5,"And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not you: for I know that you seek Jesus, which was crucified."
40,28,6,"He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay."
40,28,7,"And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall you see him: lo, I have told you."
40,28,8,"And they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word."
40,28,9,"And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying,"
40,28,10,"Then said Jesus unto them,"
40,28,11,"Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done."
40,28,12,"And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,"
40,28,13,"Saying, Say you, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept."
40,28,14,"And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you."
40,28,15,"So they took the money, and did as they were instructed: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day."
40,28,16,"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them."
40,28,17,"And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted."
40,28,18,"And Jesus came and spoke unto them, saying,"
40,28,19,""
40,28,20,""
41,1,1,"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;"
41,1,2,"As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you."
41,1,3,"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
41,1,4,"John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins."
41,1,5,"And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins."
41,1,6,"And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;"
41,1,7,"And preached, saying, There comes one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose."
41,1,8,"I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost."
41,1,9,"And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan."
41,1,10,"And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:"
41,1,11,"And there came a voice from heaven, saying, You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
41,1,12,"And immediately the spirit drives him into the wilderness."
41,1,13,"And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him."
41,1,14,"Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,"
41,1,15,"And saying,"
41,1,16,"Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers."
41,1,17,"And Jesus said unto them,"
41,1,18,"And immediately they gave up their nets, and followed him."
41,1,19,"And when he had gone a little farther from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets."
41,1,20,"And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him."
41,1,21,"And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught."
41,1,22,"And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes."
41,1,23,"And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,"
41,1,24,"Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God."
41,1,25,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying,"
41,1,26,"And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him."
41,1,27,"And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him."
41,1,28,"And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee."
41,1,29,"And immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
41,1,30,"But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and soon they tell him of her."
41,1,31,"And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them."
41,1,32,"And at evening, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils."
41,1,33,"And all the city was gathered together at the door."
41,1,34,"And he healed many that were sick of different diseases, and cast out many devils; and permitted not the devils to speak, because they knew him."
41,1,35,"And in the morning, rising up much before daybreak, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed."
41,1,36,"And Simon and they that were with him followed after him."
41,1,37,"And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for you."
41,1,38,"And he said unto them,"
41,1,39,"And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils."
41,1,40,"And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If you will, you can make me clean."
41,1,41,"And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and says unto him,"
41,1,42,"And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed."
41,1,43,"And he strictly instructed him, and immediately sent him away;"
41,1,44,"And says unto him,"
41,1,45,"But he went out, and began to announce it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was outside in deserted places: and they came to him from every quarter."
41,2,1,"And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was reported that he was in the house."
41,2,2,"And immediately many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as around the door: and he preached the word unto them."
41,2,3,"And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was carried by four."
41,2,4,"And when they could not come close unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed in which the one sick of the palsy lay."
41,2,5,"When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the one sick of the palsy,"
41,2,6,"But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,"
41,2,7,"Why does this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?"
41,2,8,"And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them,"

41,2,14,"And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him,"
41,2,15,"And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at food in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him."
41,2,16,"And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eats and drinks with publicans and sinners?"
41,2,17,"When Jesus heard it, he says unto them,"
41,2,18,"And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples fast not?"
41,2,19,"And Jesus said unto them,"

41,3,4,"And he says unto them,"
41,3,5,"And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he says unto the man,"
41,3,6,"And the Pharisees went forth, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him."
41,3,7,"But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,"
41,3,8,"And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him."
41,3,9,"And he spoke to his disciples, that a small boat should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him."
41,3,10,"For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues."
41,3,11,"And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, You are the Son of God."
41,3,12,"And he strictly instructed them that they should not make him known."
41,3,13,"And he goes up into a mountain, and calls unto him those whom he desired: and they came unto him."

41,14,29,"But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I."
41,14,30,"And Jesus says unto him,"
41,14,31,"But he spoke the more vehemently, If I should die with you, I will not deny you in any wise. Likewise also said they all."
41,14,32,"And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he says to his disciples, Sit you here, while I shall pray."
41,14,33,"And he takes with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;"
41,14,34,"And says unto them,"
41,14,35,"And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him."
41,14,36,"And he said,"
41,14,37,"And he comes, and finds them sleeping, and says unto Peter,"
41,14,38,""
41,14,39,"And again he went away, and prayed, and spoke the same words."
41,14,40,"And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither did they know what to answer him."
41,14,41,"And he comes the third time, and says unto them,"
41,14,42,""
41,14,43,"And immediately, while he yet spoke, comes Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders."
41,14,44,"And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely."
41,14,45,"And as soon as he was come, he goes immediately to him, and says, Master, master; and kissed him."
41,14,46,"And they laid their hands on him, and took him."
41,14,47,"And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear."
41,14,48,"And Jesus answered and said unto them,"
41,14,49,""
41,14,50,"And they all forsook him, and fled."
41,14,51,"And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:"
41,14,52,"And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked."
41,14,53,"And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes."
41,14,54,"And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire."
41,14,55,"And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none."
41,14,56,"For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together."
41,14,57,"And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,"
41,14,58,"We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands."
41,14,59,"But neither so did their witness agree together."
41,14,60,"And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answer you nothing? what is it which these witness against you?"
41,14,61,"But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
41,14,62,"And Jesus said,"
41,14,63,"Then the high priest tore his clothes, and says, What need we any further witnesses?"
41,14,64,"You have heard the blasphemy: what think you? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death."
41,14,65,"And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands."
41,14,66,"And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there comes one of the maids of the high priest:"
41,14,67,"And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And you also were with Jesus of Nazareth."
41,14,68,"But he denied, saying, I do not know, neither understand I what you say. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crowed."
41,14,69,"And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them."
41,14,70,"And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely you are one of them: for you are a Galilaean, and your speech agrees to that."
41,14,71,"But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I do not know this man of whom you speak."
41,14,72,"And the second time the cock crowed. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him,"
41,15,1,"And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate."
41,15,2,"And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them,"
41,15,3,"And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing."
41,15,4,"And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answer you nothing? behold how many things they witness against you."
41,15,5,"But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled."
41,15,6,"Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whoever they desired."
41,15,7,"And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection."
41,15,8,"And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had always done unto them."
41,15,9,"But Pilate answered them, saying, Will you that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"
41,15,10,"For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him because of."
41,15,11,"But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them."
41,15,12,"And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will you then that I shall do unto him whom you call the King of the Jews?"
41,15,13,"And they cried out again, Crucify him."
41,15,14,"Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him."
41,15,15,"And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had whipped him, to be crucified."
41,15,16,"And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band."
41,15,17,"And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,"
41,15,18,"And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!"
41,15,19,"And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him."
41,15,20,"And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him."
41,15,21,"And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross."
41,15,22,"And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull."
41,15,23,"And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not."
41,15,24,"And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take."
41,15,25,"And it was the third hour, and they crucified him."
41,15,26,"And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
41,15,27,"And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left."
41,15,28,"And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, And he was numbered with the transgressors."
41,15,29,"And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, you that destroys the temple, and builds it in three days,"
41,15,30,"Save yourself, and come down from the cross."
41,15,31,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save."
41,15,32,"Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him."
41,15,33,"And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
41,15,34,"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,"
41,15,35,"And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls Elijah."
41,15,36,"And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let him alone; let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down."
41,15,37,"And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost."
41,15,38,"And the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom."
41,15,39,"And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God."
41,15,40,"There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;"
41,15,41,"(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem."
41,15,42,"And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,"
41,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathaea, an honorable counselor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and requested the body of Jesus."
41,15,44,"And Pilate wondered if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead."
41,15,45,"And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph."
41,15,46,"And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulcher."
41,15,47,"And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid."
41,16,1,"And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him."
41,16,2,"And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun."
41,16,3,"And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher?"
41,16,4,"And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great."
41,16,5,"And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were frightened."
41,16,6,"And he says unto them, Be not frightened: You seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him."
41,16,7,"But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there shall you see him, as he said unto you."
41,16,8,"And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulcher; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid."
41,16,9,"Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils."
41,16,10,"And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept."
41,16,11,"And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not."
41,16,12,"After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country."
41,16,13,"And they went and told it unto the others: neither believed they them."
41,16,14,"Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at food, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not those who had seen him after he was risen."
41,16,15,"And he said unto them,"
41,16,16,""
41,16,17,""
41,16,18,""
41,16,19,"So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God."
41,16,20,"And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen."
42,1,1,"Since many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,"
42,1,2,"Just as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;"
42,1,3,"It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto you in order, most excellent Theophilus,"
42,1,4,"That you might know the certainty of those things, in which you have been instructed."
42,1,5,"There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth."
42,1,6,"And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless."
42,1,7,"And they had no child, because Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well advanced in years."
42,1,8,"And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,"
42,1,9,"According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord."
42,1,10,"And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense."
42,1,11,"And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense."
42,1,12,"And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him."
42,1,13,"But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elisabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John."
42,1,14,"And you shall have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth."
42,1,15,"For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb."
42,1,16,"And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God."
42,1,17,"And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
42,1,18,"And Zacharias said unto the angel, How shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well advanced in years."
42,1,19,"And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto you, and to show you these glad tidings."
42,1,20,"And, behold, you shall be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because you believe not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their appropriate time."
42,1,21,"And the people waited for Zacharias, and wondered why he tarried so long in the temple."
42,1,22,"And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless."
42,1,23,"And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house."
42,1,24,"And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,"
42,1,25,"Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days in which he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men."
42,1,26,"And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,"
42,1,27,"To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary."
42,1,28,"And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, you that are highly favored, the Lord is with you: blessed are you among women."
42,1,29,"And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be."
42,1,30,"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for you have found favor with God."
42,1,31,"And, behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name JESUS."
42,1,32,"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:"
42,1,33,"And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end."
42,1,34,"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"
42,1,35,"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God."
42,1,36,"And, behold, your cousin Elisabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren."
42,1,37,"For with God nothing shall be impossible."
42,1,38,"And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to your word. And the angel departed from her."
42,1,39,"And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;"
42,1,40,"And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth."
42,1,41,"And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:"
42,1,42,"And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb."
42,1,43,"And why is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"
42,1,44,"For, lo, as soon as the voice of your salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy."
42,1,45,"And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord."
42,1,46,"And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord,"
42,1,47,"And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour."
42,1,48,"For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed."
42,1,49,"For he that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy is his name."
42,1,50,"And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation."
42,1,51,"He has showed strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts."
42,1,52,"He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree."
42,1,53,"He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent empty away."
42,1,54,"He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;"
42,1,55,"As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed forever."
42,1,56,"And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house."
42,1,57,"Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son."
42,1,58,"And her neighbors and her cousins heard how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her."
42,1,59,"And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father."
42,1,60,"And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John."
42,1,61,"And they said unto her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name."
42,1,62,"And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called."
42,1,63,"And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all."
42,1,64,"And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God."
42,1,65,"And fear came on all that dwelled round about them: and all these sayings were reported abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea."
42,1,66,"And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him."
42,1,67,"And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,"
42,1,68,"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,"
42,1,69,"And has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;"
42,1,70,"As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:"
42,1,71,"That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;"
42,1,72,"To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;"
42,1,73,"The oath which he helped to our father Abraham,"
42,1,74,"That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,"
42,1,75,"In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life."
42,1,76,"And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Highest: for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;"
42,1,77,"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,"
42,1,78,"Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,"
42,1,79,"To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace."
42,1,80,"And the child grew, and grew strong in spirit, and was in the deserted places till the day of his appearance unto Israel."
42,2,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered."
42,2,2,"(And this registration was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)"
42,2,3,"And all went to be registered, every one into his own city."
42,2,4,"And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)"
42,2,5,"To be registered with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child."
42,2,6,"And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered."
42,2,7,"And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."
42,2,8,"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night."
42,2,9,"And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were intensely afraid."
42,2,10,"And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."
42,2,11,"For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord."
42,2,12,"And this shall be a sign unto you; You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."
42,2,13,"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,"
42,2,14,"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."
42,2,15,"And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord has made known unto us."
42,2,16,"And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger."
42,2,17,"And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child."
42,2,18,"And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds."
42,2,19,"But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart."
42,2,20,"And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them."
42,2,21,"And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb."
42,2,22,"And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;"
42,2,23,"(As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)"
42,2,24,"And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."
42,2,25,"And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him."
42,2,26,"And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ."
42,2,27,"And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,"
42,2,28,"Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,"
42,2,29,"Lord, now let your servant depart in peace, according to your word:"
42,2,30,"For my eyes have seen your salvation,"
42,2,31,"Which you have prepared before the face of all people;"
42,2,32,"A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel."
42,2,33,"And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him."
42,2,34,"And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;"
42,2,35,"(Yes, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
42,2,36,"And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;"
42,2,37,"And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day."
42,2,38,"And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem."
42,2,39,"And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth."
42,2,40,"And the child grew, and grew strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him."
42,2,41,"Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover."
42,2,42,"And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast."
42,2,43,"And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother did not know of it."
42,2,44,"But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance."
42,2,45,"And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him."

42,2,47,"And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers."
42,2,48,"And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why have you thus dealt with us? behold, your father and I have sought you sorrowing."
42,2,49,"And he said unto them,"

42,3,1,"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,"
42,3,2,"Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness."
42,3,3,"And he came into all the country around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;"
42,3,4,"As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
42,3,5,"Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;"
42,3,6,"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God."
42,3,7,"Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
42,3,8,"Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham."
42,3,9,"And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."
42,3,10,"And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?"
42,3,11,"He answers and says unto them, He that has two coats, let him give to him that has none; and he that has food, let him do likewise."
42,3,12,"Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?"
42,3,13,"And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you."
42,3,14,"And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages."
42,3,15,"And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;"
42,3,16,"John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I comes, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:"
42,3,17,"Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
42,3,18,"And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people."
42,3,19,"But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,"
42,3,20,"Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison."
42,3,21,"Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,"

42,4,1,"And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,"
42,4,2,"Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered."
42,4,3,"And the devil said unto him, If you be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread."
42,4,4,"And Jesus answered him, saying,"
42,4,5,"And the devil, taking him up into a high mountain, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time."
42,4,6,"And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give you, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it."
42,4,7,"If you therefore will worship me, all shall be yours."

42,4,14,"And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about."
42,4,15,"And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all."
42,4,16,"And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read."
42,4,17,"And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,"
42,4,18,"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,"
42,4,19,"To preach the acceptable year of the Lord."
42,4,20,"And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him."

42,4,32,"And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power."
42,4,33,"And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,"
42,4,34,"Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are; the Holy One of God."
42,4,35,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying,"
42,4,36,"And they were all amazed, and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out."
42,4,37,"And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about."
42,4,38,"And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they sought him for her."
42,4,39,"And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them."
42,4,40,"Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with different diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them."
42,4,41,"And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, You are Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them permitted them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ."
42,4,42,"And when it was day, he departed and went into a deserted place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and restrained him, that he should not depart from them."
42,4,43,"And he said unto them,"
42,4,44,"And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee."
42,5,1,"And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,"
42,5,2,"And saw two boats standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets."
42,5,3,"And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the boat."
42,5,4,"Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon,"
42,5,5,"And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at your word I will let down the net."
42,5,6,"And when they had this done, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net broke."
42,5,7,"And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink."
42,5,8,"When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
42,5,9,"For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the drawing of the fishes which they had taken:"
42,5,10,"And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon,"

42,5,16,"And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed."
42,5,17,"And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them."
42,5,18,"And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him."
42,5,19,"And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus."
42,5,20,"And when he saw their faith, he said unto him,"
42,5,21,"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"

42,24,23,"And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive."
42,24,24,"And certain of those who were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not."

42,24,29,"But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them."

43,1,12,"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:"
43,1,13,"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
43,1,14,"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."
43,1,15,"John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me."
43,1,16,"And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace."

43,1,19,"And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?"
43,1,20,"And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ."
43,1,21,"And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No."
43,1,22,"Then said they unto him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What say you of yourself?"
43,1,23,"He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah."

43,1,27,"He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose."
43,1,28,"These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing."
43,1,29,"The next day John sees Jesus coming unto him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world."
43,1,30,"This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me."
43,1,31,"And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water."
43,1,32,"And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him."
43,1,33,"And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost."

43,1,41,"He first finds his own brother Simon, and says unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ."

43,1,45,"Philip finds Nathanael, and says unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
43,1,46,"And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip says unto him, Come and see."
43,1,47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him,"
43,1,48,"Nathanael says unto him, From where know you me? Jesus answered and said unto him,"
43,1,49,"Nathanael answered and says unto him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."
43,1,50,"Jesus answered and said unto him,"
43,1,51,"And he says unto him,"
43,2,1,"And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:"
43,2,2,"And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage."
43,2,3,"And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus says unto him, They have no wine."
43,2,4,"Jesus says unto her,"
43,2,5,"His mother says unto the servants, Whatsoever he says unto you, do it."
43,2,6,"And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing twenty or thirty gallons each."
43,2,7,"Jesus says unto them,"
43,2,8,"And he says unto them,"
43,2,9,"When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know from where it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,"
43,2,10,"And says unto him,"
43,2,11,"This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him."
43,2,12,"After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days."
43,2,13,"And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
43,2,14,"And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:"
43,2,15,"And when he had made a whip of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;"
43,2,16,"And said unto them that sold doves,"
43,2,17,"And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your house has eaten me up."
43,2,18,"Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign do you show unto us, seeing that you are doing these things?"
43,2,19,"Jesus answered and said unto them,"
43,2,20,"Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you rear it up in three days?"
43,2,21,"But he spoke of the temple of his body."
43,2,22,"When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said."
43,2,23,"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did."
43,2,24,"But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,"
43,2,25,"And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man."
43,3,1,"There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:"
43,3,2,"The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you are doing, unless God be with him."

43,3,24,"For John was not yet cast into prison."

43,3,26,"And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him."
43,3,27,"John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, unless it be given him from heaven."

43,4,9,"Then says the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans."

43,5,3,"In these lay a great multitude of sick people, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water."
43,5,4,"For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had."
43,5,5,"And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years."
43,5,6,"When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he says unto him,"
43,5,7,"The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me."
43,5,8,"Jesus says unto him,"

43,18,37,"Pilate therefore said unto him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered,"

43,18,39,"But you have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will you therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"
43,18,40,"Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber."
43,19,1,"Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and whipped him."
43,19,2,"And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,"
43,19,3,"And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands."
43,19,4,"Pilate therefore went forth again, and says unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him."
43,19,5,"Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate says unto them, Behold the man!"
43,19,6,"When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate says unto them, Take you him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him."
43,19,7,"The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."
43,19,8,"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;"
43,19,9,"And went again into the judgment hall, and says unto Jesus, From where are you? But Jesus gave him no answer."
43,19,10,"Then says Pilate unto him, You do not speak unto me? do you not know that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you?"
43,19,11,"Jesus answered,"
43,19,12,"And from then on, Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whosoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."
43,19,13,"When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha."
43,19,14,"And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he says unto the Jews, Behold your King!"
43,19,15,"But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate says unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar."
43,19,16,"Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away."
43,19,17,"And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:"
43,19,18,"Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst."
43,19,19,"And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS."
43,19,20,"This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was close to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin."
43,19,21,"Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews."
43,19,22,"Pilate answered, What I have written I have written."
43,19,23,"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout."
43,19,24,"They said therefore among themselves, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my clothing among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did."
43,19,25,"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene."
43,19,26,"When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he says unto his mother,"
43,19,27,"Then says he to the disciple,"
43,19,28,"After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says,"
43,19,29,"Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth."
43,19,30,"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said,"
43,19,31,"The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was a high day,) asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away."
43,19,32,"Then came the soldiers, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him."
43,19,33,"But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:"
43,19,34,"But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water."
43,19,35,"And he that saw it bore record, and his record is true: and he knows that he says true, that you might believe."
43,19,36,"For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken."
43,19,37,"And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced."
43,19,38,"And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus."
43,19,39,"And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight."
43,19,40,"Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury."
43,19,41,"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, in which was never man yet laid."
43,19,42,"There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulcher was close at hand."
43,20,1,"The first day of the week comes Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulcher, and sees the stone taken away from the sepulcher."
43,20,2,"Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and says unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him."
43,20,3,"Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher."
43,20,4,"So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulcher."
43,20,5,"And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in."
43,20,6,"Then comes Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and sees the linen clothes lie,"
43,20,7,"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself."
43,20,8,"Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulcher, and he saw, and believed."
43,20,9,"For as yet they did not know the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead."
43,20,10,"Then the disciples went away again unto their own home."
43,20,11,"But Mary stood outside at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,"
43,20,12,"And sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain."
43,20,13,"And they say unto her, Woman, why do you weep? She says unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I do not know where they have laid him."
43,20,14,"And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and did not know that it was Jesus."
43,20,15,"Jesus says unto her,"
43,20,16,"Jesus says unto her,"
43,20,17,"Jesus says unto her,"
43,20,18,"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her."
43,20,19,"Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and says unto them,"
43,20,20,"And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD."
43,20,21,"Then said Jesus to them again,"
43,20,22,"And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and says unto them,"
43,20,23,""
43,20,24,"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came."
43,20,25,"The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he said unto them, Unless I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe."
43,20,26,"And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said,"
43,20,27,"Then says he to Thomas, Reach to here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach to here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing."
43,20,28,"And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God."
43,20,29,"Jesus says unto him,"
43,20,30,"And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:"
43,20,31,"But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name."
43,21,1,"After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself."
43,21,2,"There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples."
43,21,3,"Simon Peter says unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with you. They went forth, and entered into a boat immediately; and that night they caught nothing."
43,21,4,"But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus."
43,21,5,"Then Jesus says unto them,"
43,21,6,"And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes."
43,21,7,"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved says unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea."
43,21,8,"And the other disciples came in a little boat; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes."
43,21,9,"As soon then as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread."
43,21,10,"Jesus says unto them,"
43,21,11,"Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken."
43,21,12,"Jesus says unto them,"
43,21,13,"Jesus then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise."
43,21,14,"This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead."
43,21,15,"So when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter,"
43,21,16,"He says to him again the second time,"
43,21,17,"He says unto him the third time,"
43,21,18,""
43,21,19,"This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he says unto him,"
43,21,20,"Then Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays you?"
43,21,21,"Peter seeing him says to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?"
43,21,22,"Jesus says unto him,"
43,21,23,"Then went this saying abroad among the brothers, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him,"
43,21,24,"This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true."
43,21,25,"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen."
44,1,1,"The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,"
44,1,2,"Until the day in which he was taken up, after he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:"
44,1,3,"To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:"
44,1,4,"And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, says he, you have heard of me."
44,1,5,""
44,1,6,"When they therefore had come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?"

44,1,9,"And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight."

44,1,11,"Which also said, You men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven."
44,1,12,"Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey."
44,1,13,"And when they had come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James."
44,1,14,"These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers."
44,1,15,"And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about a hundred and twenty,)"
44,1,16,"Men and brothers, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus."
44,1,17,"For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry."
44,1,18,"Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst apart in the middle, and all his insides gushed out."
44,1,19,"And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood."
44,1,20,"For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell in it: and, Let another take his office."
44,1,21,"Therefore of these men which have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,"
44,1,22,"Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, one must be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection."
44,1,23,"And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias."
44,1,24,"And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two you have chosen,"
44,1,25,"That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place."
44,1,26,"And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles."
44,2,1,"And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place."
44,2,2,"And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting."
44,2,3,"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues just as of fire, and it sat upon each of them."
44,2,4,"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance."
44,2,5,"And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven."
44,2,6,"Now when this was reported abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because every man heard them speak in his own language."
44,2,7,"And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?"
44,2,8,"And how hear we every man in our own tongue, in which we were born?"
44,2,9,"Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,"
44,2,10,"Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,"
44,2,11,"Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God."
44,2,12,"And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What means this?"
44,2,13,"Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine."
44,2,14,"But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, You men of Judaea, and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:"
44,2,15,"For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day."
44,2,16,"But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;"
44,2,17,"And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:"
44,2,18,"And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:"
44,2,19,"And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:"
44,2,20,"The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:"
44,2,21,"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."
44,2,22,"You men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as you yourselves also know:"
44,2,23,"Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:"
44,2,24,"Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held by it."
44,2,25,"For David speaks concerning him, I saw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:"
44,2,26,"Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:"
44,2,27,"Because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you permit your Holy One to see corruption."
44,2,28,"You have made known to me the ways of life; you shall make me full of joy with your countenance."
44,2,29,"Men and brothers, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us unto this day."
44,2,30,"Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;"
44,2,31,"He seeing this before spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption."
44,2,32,"This Jesus has God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses."
44,2,33,"Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear."
44,2,34,"For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he says himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit you on my right hand,"
44,2,35,"Until I make your foes your footstool."
44,2,36,"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ."
44,2,37,"Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brothers, what shall we do?"
44,2,38,"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
44,2,39,"For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, just as many as the LORD our God shall call."
44,2,40,"And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation."
44,2,41,"Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls."
44,2,42,"And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers."
44,2,43,"And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles."
44,2,44,"And all that believed were together, and had all things common;"
44,2,45,"And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need."
44,2,46,"And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their food with gladness and singleness of heart,"
44,2,47,"Praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved."
44,3,1,"Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour."
44,3,2,"And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;"
44,3,3,"Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms."
44,3,4,"And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us."
44,3,5,"And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them."
44,3,6,"Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk."
44,3,7,"And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength."
44,3,8,"And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God."
44,3,9,"And all the people saw him walking and praising God:"
44,3,10,"And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him."
44,3,11,"And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering."
44,3,12,"And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?"
44,3,13,"The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go."
44,3,14,"But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;"
44,3,15,"And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses."
44,3,16,"And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all."
44,3,17,"And now, brothers, I know that through ignorance you did it, as did also your rulers."
44,3,18,"But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he has so fulfilled."
44,3,19,"Repent you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord."
44,3,20,"And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:"
44,3,21,"Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began."
44,3,22,"For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brothers, like unto me; him shall you hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you."
44,3,23,"And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people."
44,3,24,"Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days."
44,3,25,"You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in your seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed."
44,3,26,"Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities."
44,4,1,"And as they spoke unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,"
44,4,2,"Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead."
44,4,3,"And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now evening."
44,4,4,"Howbeit many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand."
44,4,5,"And it came to pass on the next day, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,"
44,4,6,"And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem."
44,4,7,"And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have you done this?"
44,4,8,"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,"
44,4,9,"If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the sick man, by what means he is made whole;"
44,4,10,"Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him does this man stand here before you whole."
44,4,11,"This is the stone which was set at no value of you builders, which is become the head of the corner."
44,4,12,"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."
44,4,13,"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus."
44,4,14,"And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it."
44,4,15,"But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,"
44,4,16,"Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it."
44,4,17,"But that it spread no further among the people, let us strictly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name."
44,4,18,"And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus."
44,4,19,"But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge you."
44,4,20,"For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."
44,4,21,"So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done."
44,4,22,"For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was showed."
44,4,23,"And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them."
44,4,24,"And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:"
44,4,25,"Who by the mouth of your servant David have said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?"
44,4,26,"The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ."
44,4,27,"For of a truth against your holy child Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,"
44,4,28,"For to do whatsoever your hand and your counsel determined before to be done."
44,4,29,"And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto your servants, that with all boldness they may speak your word,"
44,4,30,"By stretching forth your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of your holy child Jesus."
44,4,31,"And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with boldness."
44,4,32,"And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that anything of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common."
44,4,33,"And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all."
44,4,34,"Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,"
44,4,35,"And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need."
44,4,36,"And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,"
44,4,37,"Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet."
44,5,1,"But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,"
44,5,2,"And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet."
44,5,3,"But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?"
44,5,4,"Whiles it remained, was it not your own? and after it was sold, was it not in your own power? why have you conceived this thing in your heart? you have not lied unto men, but unto God."
44,5,5,"And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things."
44,5,6,"And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him."
44,5,7,"And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in."
44,5,8,"And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much."
44,5,9,"Then Peter said unto her, How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and shall carry you out."
44,5,10,"Then fell she down immediately at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband."
44,5,11,"And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things."
44,5,12,"And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch."
44,5,13,"And of the rest no man dared join himself to them: but the people magnified them."
44,5,14,"And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)"
44,5,15,"Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them."
44,5,16,"There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one."
44,5,17,"Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,"
44,5,18,"And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison."
44,5,19,"But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,"
44,5,20,"Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
44,5,21,"And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought."
44,5,22,"But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told,"
44,5,23,"Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing outside before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within."
44,5,24,"Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow."
44,5,25,"Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people."
44,5,26,"Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned."
44,5,27,"And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,"
44,5,28,"Saying, Did not we strictly command you that you should not teach in this name? and, behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us."
44,5,29,"Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men."
44,5,30,"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree."
44,5,31,"Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins."
44,5,32,"And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God has given to them that obey him."
44,5,33,"When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them."
44,5,34,"Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;"
44,5,35,"And said unto them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men."
44,5,36,"For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought."
44,5,37,"After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away many people after him: he also perished; and all, just as many as obeyed him, were dispersed."
44,5,38,"And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:"
44,5,39,"But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it; lest haply you be found even to fight against God."
44,5,40,"And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go."
44,5,41,"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name."
44,5,42,"And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ."
44,6,1,"And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration."
44,6,2,"Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables."
44,6,3,"Therefore, brothers, select among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business."
44,6,4,"But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word."
44,6,5,"And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:"
44,6,6,"Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them."
44,6,7,"And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith."
44,6,8,"And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people."
44,6,9,"Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen."
44,6,10,"And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke."
44,6,11,"Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God."
44,6,12,"And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,"
44,6,13,"And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:"
44,6,14,"For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us."
44,6,15,"And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel."
44,7,1,"Then said the high priest, Are these things so?"
44,7,2,"And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,"
44,7,3,"And said unto him, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and come into the land which I shall show you."
44,7,4,"Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelled in Charran: and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, in which you now dwell."
44,7,5,"And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child."
44,7,6,"And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years."
44,7,7,"And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place."
44,7,8,"And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs."
44,7,9,"And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,"
44,7,10,"And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house."
44,7,11,"Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance."
44,7,12,"But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first."
44,7,13,"And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh."
44,7,14,"Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls."
44,7,15,"So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,"
44,7,16,"And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem."
44,7,17,"But when the time of the promise drew close, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,"
44,7,18,"Till another king arose, which did not know Joseph."
44,7,19,"The same dealt deceptively with our kindred, and badly treated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live."
44,7,20,"In which time Moses was born, and was exceedingly fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months:"
44,7,21,"And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son."
44,7,22,"And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds."
44,7,23,"And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers the children of Israel."
44,7,24,"And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:"
44,7,25,"For he supposed his brothers would have understood that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not."
44,7,26,"And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, you are brothers; why do you wrong one to another?"
44,7,27,"But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?"
44,7,28,"Do you want kill me, as you did the Egyptian yesterday?"
44,7,29,"Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons."
44,7,30,"And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush."
44,7,31,"When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,"
44,7,32,"Saying, I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and dared not behold."
44,7,33,"Then said the Lord to him, Put off your shoes from your feet: for the place where you stand is holy ground."
44,7,34,"I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you into Egypt."
44,7,35,"This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush."
44,7,36,"He brought them out, after he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years."
44,7,37,"This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brothers, like unto me; him shall you hear."
44,7,38,"This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:"
44,7,39,"To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,"
44,7,40,"Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him."
44,7,41,"And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands."
44,7,42,"Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?"
44,7,43,"Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon."
44,7,44,"Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen."
44,7,45,"Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;"
44,7,46,"Who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob."
44,7,47,"But Solomon built him a house."
44,7,48,"Howbeit the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as says the prophet,"
44,7,49,"Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will you build me? says the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?"
44,7,50,"Has not my hand made all these things?"
44,7,51,"You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you."
44,7,52,"Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain those who showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:"
44,7,53,"Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it."
44,7,54,"When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth."
44,7,55,"But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,"
44,7,56,"And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God."
44,7,57,"Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,"
44,7,58,"And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul."
44,7,59,"And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
44,7,60,"And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep."
44,8,1,"And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles."
44,8,2,"And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him."
44,8,3,"As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison."
44,8,4,"Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word."
44,8,5,"Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them."
44,8,6,"And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did."
44,8,7,"For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed."
44,8,8,"And there was great joy in that city."
44,8,9,"But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:"
44,8,10,"To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God."
44,8,11,"And to him they had regard, because of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries."
44,8,12,"But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."
44,8,13,"Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done."
44,8,14,"Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:"
44,8,15,"Who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:"
44,8,16,"(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)"
44,8,17,"Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost."
44,8,18,"And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,"
44,8,19,"Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost."
44,8,20,"But Peter said unto him, Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money."
44,8,21,"You have neither part nor lot in this matter: for your heart is not right in the sight of God."
44,8,22,"Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you."
44,8,23,"For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity."
44,8,24,"Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the LORD for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come upon me."
44,8,25,"And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans."
44,8,26,"And the angel of the Lord spoke unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is deserted."
44,8,27,"And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,"
44,8,28,"Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Isaiah the prophet."
44,8,29,"Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join yourself to this chariot."
44,8,30,"And Philip ran to there to him, and heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you understand what you read?"
44,8,31,"And he said, How can I, unless some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him."
44,8,32,"The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:"
44,8,33,"In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth."
44,8,34,"And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray you, of whom speaks the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?"
44,8,35,"Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus."
44,8,36,"And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what does hinder me to be baptized?"
44,8,37,"And Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, you may. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
44,8,38,"And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him."
44,8,39,"And when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing."
44,8,40,"But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea."
44,9,1,"And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,"
44,9,2,"And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem."
44,9,3,"And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:"
44,9,4,"And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him,"
44,9,5,"And he said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said,"
44,9,6,"And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do? And the Lord said unto him,"
44,9,7,"And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man."
44,9,8,"And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus."
44,9,9,"And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink."
44,9,10,"And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision,"
44,9,11,"And the Lord said unto him,"
44,9,12,""
44,9,13,"Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:"
44,9,14,"And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on your name."
44,9,15,"But the Lord said unto him,"
44,9,16,""
44,9,17,"And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto you on the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost."
44,9,18,"And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight immediately, and arose, and was baptized."
44,9,19,"And when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus."
44,9,20,"And immediately he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God."
44,9,21,"But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and came to here for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?"
44,9,22,"But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelled at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ."
44,9,23,"And after many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:"
44,9,24,"But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him."
44,9,25,"Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket."
44,9,26,"And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple."
44,9,27,"But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord on the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus."
44,9,28,"And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem."
44,9,29,"And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him."
44,9,30,"Which when the brothers knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus."
44,9,31,"Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied."
44,9,32,"And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelled at Lydda."
44,9,33,"And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy."
44,9,34,"And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you whole: arise, and make your bed. And he arose immediately."
44,9,35,"And all that dwelled at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord."
44,9,36,"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did."
44,9,37,"And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber."
44,9,38,"And forasmuch as Lydda was close to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them."
44,9,39,"Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them."
44,9,40,"But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up."
44,9,41,"And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive."
44,9,42,"And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord."
44,9,43,"And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner."
44,10,1,"There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,"
44,10,2,"A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always."
44,10,3,"He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius."
44,10,4,"And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Your prayers and your alms are come up for a memorial before God."
44,10,5,"And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:"
44,10,6,"He lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the seaside: he shall tell you what you should do."
44,10,7,"And when the angel which spoke unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;"
44,10,8,"And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa."
44,10,9,"On the next day, as they went on their journey, and drew close unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:"
44,10,10,"And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,"
44,10,11,"And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:"
44,10,12,"Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air."
44,10,13,"And there came a voice to him,"
44,10,14,"But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean."
44,10,15,"And the voice spoke unto him again the second time,"
44,10,16,"This was done three times: and the vessel was received up again into heaven."
44,10,17,"Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,"
44,10,18,"And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there."
44,10,19,"While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek you."
44,10,20,"Arise therefore, and get you down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them."
44,10,21,"Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek: what is the cause why you are come?"
44,10,22,"And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fears God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for you into his house, and to hear words of you."
44,10,23,"Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the next day Peter went away with them, and certain brothers from Joppa accompanied him."
44,10,24,"And the next day after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends."
44,10,25,"And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him."
44,10,26,"But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man."
44,10,27,"And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together."
44,10,28,"And he said unto them, You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean."
44,10,29,"Therefore came I unto you without opposing, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent you have sent for me?"
44,10,30,"And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,"
44,10,31,"And said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God."
44,10,32,"Send therefore to Joppa, and call to here Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he comes, shall speak unto you."
44,10,33,"Immediately therefore I sent to you; and you have well done that you are come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded you of God."
44,10,34,"Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:"
44,10,35,"But in every nation he that fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted with him."
44,10,36,"The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)"
44,10,37,"That word, I say, you know, which was spoken out throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;"
44,10,38,"How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him."
44,10,39,"And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:"
44,10,40,"Him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly;"
44,10,41,"Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead."
44,10,42,"And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead."
44,10,43,"To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins."
44,10,44,"While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all those who heard the word."
44,10,45,"And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost."
44,10,46,"For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,"
44,10,47,"Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?"
44,10,48,"And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days."
44,11,1,"And the apostles and brothers that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God."
44,11,2,"And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,"
44,11,3,"Saying, You went in to men uncircumcised, and did eat with them."
44,11,4,"But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,"
44,11,5,"I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:"
44,11,6,"Upon the which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air."
44,11,7,"And I heard a voice saying unto me,"
44,11,8,"But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth."
44,11,9,"But the voice answered me again from heaven,"
44,11,10,"And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven."
44,11,11,"And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me."
44,11,12,"And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brothers accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:"
44,11,13,"And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;"
44,11,14,"Who shall tell you words, whereby you and all your house shall be saved."
44,11,15,"And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning."
44,11,16,"Then remembered I the word of the Lord, that he said,"
44,11,17,"Since God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?"
44,11,18,"When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life."
44,11,19,"Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only."
44,11,20,"And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they had come to Antioch, spoke unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus."
44,11,21,"And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord."
44,11,22,"Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch."
44,11,23,"Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord."
44,11,24,"For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and many people was added unto the Lord."
44,11,25,"Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:"
44,11,26,"And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught many people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch."
44,11,27,"And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch."
44,11,28,"And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar."
44,11,29,"Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:"
44,11,30,"Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul."
44,12,1,"Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church."
44,12,2,"And he killed James the brother of John with the sword."
44,12,3,"And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)"
44,12,4,"And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after passover to bring him forth to the people."
44,12,5,"Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him."
44,12,6,"And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison."
44,12,7,"And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands."
44,12,8,"And the angel said unto him, Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals. And so he did. And he says unto him, Cast your garment about you, and follow me."
44,12,9,"And he went out, and followed him; and knew not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision."
44,12,10,"When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leads unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel departed from him."
44,12,11,"And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the LORD has sent his angel, and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews."
44,12,12,"And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying."
44,12,13,"And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda."
44,12,14,"And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate."
44,12,15,"And they said unto her, You are mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel."
44,12,16,"But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished."
44,12,17,"But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go show these things unto James, and to the brothers. And he departed, and went into another place."
44,12,18,"Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter."
44,12,19,"And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode."
44,12,20,"And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country."
44,12,21,"And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them."
44,12,22,"And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man."
44,12,23,"And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost."
44,12,24,"But the word of God grew and multiplied."
44,12,25,"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark."
44,13,1,"Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."
44,13,2,"As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them."
44,13,3,"And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away."
44,13,4,"So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus."
44,13,5,"And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister."
44,13,6,"And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:"
44,13,7,"Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God."
44,13,8,"But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith."
44,13,9,"Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him."
44,13,10,"And said, O full of all trickery and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?"
44,13,11,"And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand."
44,13,12,"Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord."
44,13,13,"Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem."
44,13,14,"But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down."
44,13,15,"And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, You men and brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on."
44,13,16,"Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you that fear God, give audience."
44,13,17,"The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelled as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm brought he them out of it."
44,13,18,"And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness."
44,13,19,"And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot."
44,13,20,"And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet."
44,13,21,"And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years."
44,13,22,"And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, which shall fulfill all my will."
44,13,23,"Of this man's seed has God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:"
44,13,24,"When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel."
44,13,25,"And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think you that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there comes one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose."
44,13,26,"Men and brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent."
44,13,27,"For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him."
44,13,28,"And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain."
44,13,29,"And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulcher."
44,13,30,"But God raised him from the dead:"
44,13,31,"And he was seen many days of those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people."
44,13,32,"And we declare unto you glad tidings, that the promise which was made unto the fathers,"
44,13,33,"God has fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you."
44,13,34,"And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David."
44,13,35,"Therefore he says also in another psalm, You shall not permit your Holy One to see corruption."
44,13,36,"For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:"
44,13,37,"But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption."
44,13,38,"Be it known unto you therefore, men and brothers, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:"
44,13,39,"And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses."
44,13,40,"Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;"
44,13,41,"Behold, you despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which you shall in no way believe, though a man declare it unto you."
44,13,42,"And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles asked that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath."
44,13,43,"Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God."
44,13,44,"And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God."
44,13,45,"But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spoke against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming."
44,13,46,"Then Paul and Barnabas grown bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles."
44,13,47,"For so has the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set you to be a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation unto the ends of the earth."
44,13,48,"And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed."
44,13,49,"And the word of the Lord was spoken out throughout all the region."
44,13,50,"But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their borders."
44,13,51,"But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium."
44,13,52,"And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost."
44,14,1,"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed."
44,14,2,"But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brothers."
44,14,3,"Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands."
44,14,4,"But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles."
44,14,5,"And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,"
44,14,6,"They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lies round about:"
44,14,7,"And there they preached the gospel."
44,14,8,"And there sat a certain man at Lystra, sick in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:"
44,14,9,"The same heard Paul speak: who steadfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,"
44,14,10,"Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet. And he leaped and walked."
44,14,11,"And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men."
44,14,12,"And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker."
44,14,13,"Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people."
44,14,14,"Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they tear their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,"
44,14,15,"And saying, Sirs, why do you these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in it:"
44,14,16,"Who in times past permitted all nations to walk in their own ways."
44,14,17,"Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
44,14,18,"And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them."
44,14,19,"And there came to there certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead."
44,14,20,"Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe."
44,14,21,"And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,"
44,14,22,"Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."
44,14,23,"And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed."
44,14,24,"And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia."
44,14,25,"And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:"
44,14,26,"And from there sailed to Antioch, from where they ha been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled."
44,14,27,"And when they had come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles."
44,14,28,"And there they abode long time with the disciples."
44,15,1,"And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brothers, and said, Unless you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved."
44,15,2,"When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question."
44,15,3,"And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brothers."
44,15,4,"And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them."
44,15,5,"But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses."
44,15,6,"And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter."
44,15,7,"And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brothers, you know that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe."
44,15,8,"And God, which knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, just as he did unto us;"
44,15,9,"And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith."
44,15,10,"Now therefore why tempt you God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
44,15,11,"But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, just as they."
44,15,12,"Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them."
44,15,13,"And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brothers, hearken unto me:"
44,15,14,"Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name."
44,15,15,"And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,"
44,15,16,"After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins of it, and I will set it up:"
44,15,17,"That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, says the Lord, who does all these things."
44,15,18,"Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world."
44,15,19,"Therefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:"
44,15,20,"But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood."
44,15,21,"For Moses of old time has in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day."
44,15,22,"Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:"
44,15,23,"And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting unto the brothers which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia."
44,15,24,"Since as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:"
44,15,25,"It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"
44,15,26,"Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,15,27,"We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth."
44,15,28,"For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;"
44,15,29,"That you abstain from foods offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare you well."
44,15,30,"So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:"
44,15,31,"Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation."
44,15,32,"And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them."
44,15,33,"And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brothers unto the apostles."
44,15,34,"Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still."
44,15,35,"Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also."
44,15,36,"And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do."
44,15,37,"And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark."
44,15,38,"But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work."
44,15,39,"And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;"
44,15,40,"And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brothers unto the grace of God."
44,15,41,"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches."
44,16,1,"Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:"
44,16,2,"Which was well reported of by the brothers that were at Lystra and Iconium."
44,16,3,"Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek."
44,16,4,"And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem."
44,16,5,"And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily."
44,16,6,"Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,"
44,16,7,"After they had come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit permitted them not."
44,16,8,"And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas."
44,16,9,"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us."
44,16,10,"And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them."
44,16,11,"Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;"
44,16,12,"And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days."
44,16,13,"And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was accustomed to be made; and we sat down, and spoke unto the women which resorted to there."
44,16,14,"And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Youratira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul."
44,16,15,"And when she was baptized, and her household, she asked us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us."
44,16,16,"And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:"
44,16,17,"The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way of salvation."
44,16,18,"And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour."
44,16,19,"And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,"
44,16,20,"And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,"
44,16,21,"And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans."
44,16,22,"And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates tore off their clothes, and commanded to beat them."
44,16,23,"And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely:"
44,16,24,"Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks."
44,16,25,"And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them."
44,16,26,"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed."
44,16,27,"And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled."
44,16,28,"But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm: for we are all here."
44,16,29,"Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,"
44,16,30,"And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44,16,31,"And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house."
44,16,32,"And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house."
44,16,33,"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately."
44,16,34,"And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house."
44,16,35,"And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go."
44,16,36,"And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace."
44,16,37,"But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out secretly? no truthfully; but let them come themselves and fetch us out."
44,16,38,"And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans."
44,16,39,"And they came and sought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city."
44,16,40,"And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brothers, they comforted them, and departed."
44,17,1,"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:"
44,17,2,"And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,"
44,17,3,"Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ."
44,17,4,"And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few."
44,17,5,"But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people."
44,17,6,"And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brothers unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come to here also;"
44,17,7,"Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus."
44,17,8,"And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things."
44,17,9,"And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go."
44,17,10,"And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming to there went into the synagogue of the Jews."
44,17,11,"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."
44,17,12,"Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few."
44,17,13,"But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came to there also, and stirred up the people."
44,17,14,"And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still."
44,17,15,"And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed."
44,17,16,"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry."
44,17,17,"Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him."
44,17,18,"Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection."
44,17,19,"And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof you speak, is?"
44,17,20,"For you bring certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean."
44,17,21,"(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)"
44,17,22,"Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, You men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious."
44,17,23,"For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."
44,17,24,"God that made the world and all things in it, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;"
44,17,25,"Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things;"
44,17,26,"And has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;"
44,17,27,"That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:"
44,17,28,"For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring."
44,17,29,"Since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by are and man's device."
44,17,30,"And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:"
44,17,31,"Because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance unto all men, in that he has raised him from the dead."
44,17,32,"And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again of this matter."
44,17,33,"So Paul departed from among them."
44,17,34,"Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them."
44,18,1,"After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;"
44,18,2,"And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them."
44,18,3,"And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers."
44,18,4,"And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks."
44,18,5,"And when Silas and Timotheus had come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ."
44,18,6,"And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his clothing, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean; from now on I will go unto the Gentiles."
44,18,7,"And he departed from there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue."
44,18,8,"And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized."
44,18,9,"Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision,"
44,18,10,""
44,18,11,"And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."
44,18,12,"And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,"
44,18,13,"Saying, This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."
44,18,14,"And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:"
44,18,15,"But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look you to it; for I will be no judge of such matters."
44,18,16,"And he drove them from the judgment seat."
44,18,17,"Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things."
44,18,18,"And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow."
44,18,19,"And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews."
44,18,20,"When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;"
44,18,21,"But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus."
44,18,22,"And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch."
44,18,23,"And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples."
44,18,24,"And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus."
44,18,25,"This man was instructed on the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John."
44,18,26,"And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly."
44,18,27,"And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brothers wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:"
44,18,28,"For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ."
44,19,1,"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper borders came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,"
44,19,2,"He said unto them, Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost."
44,19,3,"And he said unto them, Unto what then were you baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism."
44,19,4,"Then said Paul, John truthfully baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus."
44,19,5,"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,19,6,"And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied."
44,19,7,"And all the men were about twelve."
44,19,8,"And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God."
44,19,9,"But when different were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus."
44,19,10,"And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelled in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks."
44,19,11,"And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:"
44,19,12,"So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them."
44,19,13,"Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over those who had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth."
44,19,14,"And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so."
44,19,15,"And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?"
44,19,16,"And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
44,19,17,"And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified."
44,19,18,"And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds."
44,19,19,"Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver."
44,19,20,"So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed."
44,19,21,"After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
44,19,22,"So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season."
44,19,23,"And the same time there arose no small stir about that way."
44,19,24,"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;"
44,19,25,"Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you know that by this craft we have our wealth."
44,19,26,"Moreover you see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:"
44,19,27,"So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships."
44,19,28,"And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
44,19,29,"And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theater."
44,19,30,"And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples did not permit."
44,19,31,"And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theater."
44,19,32,"Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part did not know why they were come together."
44,19,33,"And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense unto the people."
44,19,34,"But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
44,19,35,"And when the town clerk had appeased the people, he said, You men of Ephesus, what man is there that knows not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?"
44,19,36,"Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly."
44,19,37,"For you have brought to here these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess."
44,19,38,"Therefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them plead with one another."
44,19,39,"But if you inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly."
44,19,40,"For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse."
44,19,41,"And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly."
44,20,1,"And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia."
44,20,2,"And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,"
44,20,3,"And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia."
44,20,4,"And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus."
44,20,5,"These going before tarried for us at Troas."
44,20,6,"And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days."
44,20,7,"And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the next day; and continued his speech until midnight."
44,20,8,"And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together."
44,20,9,"And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead."
44,20,10,"And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him."
44,20,11,"When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed."
44,20,12,"And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted."
44,20,13,"And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go on foot."
44,20,14,"And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene."
44,20,15,"And we sailed from there, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus."
44,20,16,"For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost."
44,20,17,"And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church."
44,20,18,"And when they had come to him, he said unto them, You know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,"
44,20,19,"Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:"
44,20,20,"And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,"
44,20,21,"Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,20,22,"And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:"
44,20,23,"Save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me."
44,20,24,"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God."
44,20,25,"And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more."
44,20,26,"Therefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men."
44,20,27,"For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God."
44,20,28,"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood."
44,20,29,"For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock."
44,20,30,"Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them."
44,20,31,"Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears."
44,20,32,"And now, brothers, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified."
44,20,33,"I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel."
44,20,34,"Yes, you yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me."
44,20,35,"I have showed you all things, that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said,"
44,20,36,"And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all."
44,20,37,"And they all wept intensely, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,"
44,20,38,"Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship."
44,21,1,"And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from there unto Patara:"
44,21,2,"And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth."
44,21,3,"Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unload her burden."
44,21,4,"And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,5,"And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed."
44,21,6,"And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again."
44,21,7,"And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brothers, and abode with them one day."
44,21,8,"And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him."
44,21,9,"And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy."
44,21,10,"And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus."
44,21,11,"And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus says the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owns this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles."
44,21,12,"And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, asked him not to go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,13,"Then Paul answered, What mean you to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,21,14,"And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done."
44,21,15,"And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem."
44,21,16,"There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge."
44,21,17,"And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly."
44,21,18,"And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present."
44,21,19,"And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry."
44,21,20,"And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:"
44,21,21,"And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs."
44,21,22,"What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that you are come."
44,21,23,"Do therefore this that we say to you: We have four men which have a vow on them;"
44,21,24,"Them take, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law."
44,21,25,"As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication."
44,21,26,"Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them."
44,21,27,"And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,"
44,21,28,"Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teaches all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and has polluted this holy place."
44,21,29,"(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)"
44,21,30,"And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and immediately the doors were shut."
44,21,31,"And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar."
44,21,32,"Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul."
44,21,33,"Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done."
44,21,34,"And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle."
44,21,35,"And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people."
44,21,36,"For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him."
44,21,37,"And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto you? Who said, Can you speak Greek?"
44,21,38,"Are not you that Egyptian, which before these days made an uproar, and led out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?"
44,21,39,"But Paul said, I am a man who is a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech you, permit me to speak unto the people."
44,21,40,"And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spoke unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,"
44,22,1,"Men, brothers, and fathers, hear you my defense which I make now unto you."
44,22,2,"(And when they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he says,)"
44,22,3,"I am truthfully a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day."
44,22,4,"And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women."
44,22,5,"As also the high priest does bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brothers, and went to Damascus, to bring those who were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished."
44,22,6,"And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come close unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me."
44,22,7,"And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,"
44,22,8,"And I answered, Who are you, Lord? And he said unto me,"
44,22,9,"And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me."
44,22,10,"And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me,"
44,22,11,"And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus."
44,22,12,"And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelled there,"
44,22,13,"Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him."
44,22,14,"And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of his mouth."
44,22,15,"For you shall be his witness unto all men of what you have seen and heard."
44,22,16,"And now why do you tarry? arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord."
44,22,17,"And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;"
44,22,18,"And saw him saying unto me,"
44,22,19,"And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on you:"
44,22,20,"And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the clothing of them that slew him."
44,22,21,"And he said unto me,"
44,22,22,"And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live."
44,22,23,"And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,"
44,22,24,"The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know why they cried so against him."
44,22,25,"And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to whip a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?"
44,22,26,"When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what you are doing: for this man is a Roman."
44,22,27,"Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, are you a Roman? He said, yes."
44,22,28,"And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born."
44,22,29,"Then immediately they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him."
44,22,30,"On the next day, because he would have known the certainty why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them."
44,23,1,"And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day."
44,23,2,"And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth."
44,23,3,"Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite you, you whited wall: for do you sit to judge me after the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?"
44,23,4,"And they that stood by said, Do you revile God's high priest?"
44,23,5,"Then said Paul, I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest: for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people."
44,23,6,"But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question."
44,23,7,"And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided."
44,23,8,"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both."
44,23,9,"And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God."
44,23,10,"And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle."
44,23,11,"And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said,"
44,23,12,"And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul."
44,23,13,"And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy."
44,23,14,"And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul."
44,23,15,"Now therefore you with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you tomorrow, as though you would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him."
44,23,16,"And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul."
44,23,17,"Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he has a certain thing to tell him."
44,23,18,"So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto you, who has something to say unto you."
44,23,19,"Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside secretly, and asked him, What is that you have to tell me?"
44,23,20,"And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire you that you would bring down Paul tomorrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly."
44,23,21,"But do not you yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from you."
44,23,22,"So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See you tell no man that you have showed these things to me."
44,23,23,"And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;"
44,23,24,"And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor."
44,23,25,"And he wrote a letter after this manner:"
44,23,26,"Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sends greeting."
44,23,27,"This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman."
44,23,28,"And when I would have known the cause why they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:"
44,23,29,"Whom I perceived to be accused by questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds."
44,23,30,"And when it was told me that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent immediately to you, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before you what they had against him. Farewell."
44,23,31,"Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris."
44,23,32,"On the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:"
44,23,33,"Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him."
44,23,34,"And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;"
44,23,35,"I will hear you, said he, when your accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall."
44,24,1,"And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul."
44,24,2,"And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by you we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by your providence,"
44,24,3,"We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness."
44,24,4,"Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto you, I pray you that you would hear us of your clemency a few words."
44,24,5,"For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:"
44,24,6,"Who also has gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law."
44,24,7,"But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,"
44,24,8,"Commanding his accusers to come unto you: by examining of whom yourself may take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him."
44,24,9,"And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so."
44,24,10,"Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Since as I know that you have been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:"
44,24,11,"Because that you may understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship."
44,24,12,"And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:"
44,24,13,"Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me."
44,24,14,"But this I confess unto you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:"
44,24,15,"And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."
44,24,16,"And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men."
44,24,17,"Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings."
44,24,18,"Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult."
44,24,19,"Who ought to have been here before you, and object, if they had ought against me."
44,24,20,"Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,"
44,24,21,"Unless it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day."
44,24,22,"And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the last of your matter."
44,24,23,"And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him."
44,24,24,"And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ."
44,24,25,"And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you."
44,24,26,"He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: therefore he sent for him the more often, and communed with him."
44,24,27,"But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound."
44,25,1,"Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem."
44,25,2,"Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,"
44,25,3,"And desired favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait on the way to kill him."
44,25,4,"But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly to there."
44,25,5,"Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him."
44,25,6,"And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought."
44,25,7,"And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove."
44,25,8,"While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all."
44,25,9,"But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Do you want go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?"
44,25,10,"Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as you very well know."
44,25,11,"For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar."
44,25,12,"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Have you appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shall you go."
44,25,13,"And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus."
44,25,14,"And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:"
44,25,15,"About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him."
44,25,16,"To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him."
44,25,17,"Therefore, when they had come to here, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth."
44,25,18,"Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:"
44,25,19,"But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive."
44,25,20,"And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters."
44,25,21,"But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar."
44,25,22,"Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, you shall hear him."
44,25,23,"And on the next day, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth."
44,25,24,"And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer."
44,25,25,"But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him."
44,25,26,"Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write."
44,25,27,"For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not also to signify the crimes laid against him."
44,26,1,"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:"
44,26,2,"I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before you touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews:"
44,26,3,"Especially because I know you to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: therefore I beseech you to hear me patiently."
44,26,4,"My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;"
44,26,5,"Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee."
44,26,6,"And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers:"
44,26,7,"Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews."
44,26,8,"Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?"
44,26,9,"I truthfully thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
44,26,10,"Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them."
44,26,11,"And I punished them often in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities."
44,26,12,"Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,"
44,26,13,"At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and those who journeyed with me."
44,26,14,"And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue,"
44,26,15,"And I said, Who are you, Lord? And he said,"
44,26,16,""
44,26,17,""
44,26,18,""
44,26,19,"Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:"
44,26,20,"But showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the borders of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works suitable for repentance."
44,26,21,"For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me."
44,26,22,"Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:"
44,26,23,"That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show light unto the people, and to the Gentiles."
44,26,24,"And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning does make you mad."
44,26,25,"But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness."
44,26,26,"For the king knows of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner."
44,26,27,"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."
44,26,28,"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost you persuade me to be a Christian."
44,26,29,"And Paul said, I would to God, that not only you, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds."
44,26,30,"And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:"
44,26,31,"And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
44,26,32,"Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar."
44,27,1,"And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band."
44,27,2,"And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the borders of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us."
44,27,3,"And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously treated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself."
44,27,4,"And when we had launched from there, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary."
44,27,5,"And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia."
44,27,6,"And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us in it."
44,27,7,"And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce had come over against Cnidus, the wind not permitting us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;"
44,27,8,"And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; close whereunto was the city of Lasea."
44,27,9,"Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,"
44,27,10,"And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives."
44,27,11,"Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul."
44,27,12,"And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart from there also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is a haven of Crete, and lies toward the south west and north west."
44,27,13,"And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing from there, they sailed close by Crete."
44,27,14,"But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon."
44,27,15,"And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive."
44,27,16,"And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:"
44,27,17,"Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, struck sail, and so were driven."
44,27,18,"And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;"
44,27,19,"And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship."
44,27,20,"And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away."
44,27,21,"But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, you should have harkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss."
44,27,22,"And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship."
44,27,23,"For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,"
44,27,24,"Saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God has given you all them that sail with you."
44,27,25,"Therefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be just as it was told me."
44,27,26,"Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island."
44,27,27,"But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;"
44,27,28,"And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms."
44,27,29,"Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day."
44,27,30,"And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under color as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,"
44,27,31,"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship, you cannot be saved."
44,27,32,"Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off."
44,27,33,"And while the day was coming on, Paul asked them all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing."
44,27,34,"Therefore I pray you to take some food: for this is for your health: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you."
44,27,35,"And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat."
44,27,36,"Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some food."
44,27,37,"And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls."
44,27,38,"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea."
44,27,39,"And when it was day, they did not know the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship."
44,27,40,"And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore."
44,27,41,"And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves."
44,27,42,"And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape."
44,27,43,"But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:"
44,27,44,"And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land."
44,28,1,"And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita."
44,28,2,"And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold."
44,28,3,"And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand."
44,28,4,"And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet vengeance did not permit to live."
44,28,5,"And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm."
44,28,6,"Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god."
44,28,7,"In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously."
44,28,8,"And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him."
44,28,9,"So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:"
44,28,10,"Who also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary."
44,28,11,"And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux."
44,28,12,"And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days."
44,28,13,"And from there we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:"
44,28,14,"Where we found brothers, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome."
44,28,15,"And from there, when the brothers heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage."
44,28,16,"And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him."
44,28,17,"And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they had come together, he said unto them, Men and brothers, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
44,28,18,"Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me."
44,28,19,"But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had anything to accuse my nation of."
44,28,20,"For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."
44,28,21,"And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning you, neither any of the brothers that came showed or spoke any harm of you."
44,28,22,"But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against."
44,28,23,"And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening."
44,28,24,"And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not."
44,28,25,"And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,"
44,28,26,"Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and not perceive:"
44,28,27,"For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."
44,28,28,"Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it."
44,28,29,"And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves."
44,28,30,"And Paul dwelled two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,"
44,28,31,"Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him."
45,1,1,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,"
45,1,2,"(Which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)"
45,1,3,"Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;"
45,1,4,"And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:"
45,1,5,"By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:"
45,1,6,"Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:"
45,1,7,"To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
45,1,8,"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world."
45,1,9,"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;"
45,1,10,"Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you."
45,1,11,"For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;"
45,1,12,"That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me."
45,1,13,"Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was hindered until now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among other Gentiles."
45,1,14,"I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise."
45,1,15,"So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also."
45,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."
45,1,17,"For in it is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith."
45,1,18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;"
45,1,19,"Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it unto them."
45,1,20,"For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:"
45,1,21,"Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."
45,1,22,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,"
45,1,23,"And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like unto corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things."
45,1,24,"Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:"
45,1,25,"Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen."
45,1,26,"For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:"
45,1,27,"And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was suitable."
45,1,28,"And just as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;"
45,1,29,"Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,"
45,1,30,"Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
45,1,31,"Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:"
45,1,32,"Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."
45,2,1,"Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whosoever you are that judges: for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you that judge are doing the same things."
45,2,2,"But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who commit such things."
45,2,3,"And think you this, O man, that judge those who do such things, and are doing the same, that you shall escape the judgment of God?"
45,2,4,"Or do you despise the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?"
45,2,5,"But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up unto yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;"
45,2,6,"Who will render to every man according to his deeds:"
45,2,7,"To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:"
45,2,8,"But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,"
45,2,9,"Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;"
45,2,10,"But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:"
45,2,11,"For there is no respect of persons with God."
45,2,12,"For as many as have sinned outside law shall also perish outside law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;"
45,2,13,"(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified."
45,2,14,"For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:"
45,2,15,"Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)"
45,2,16,"In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel."
45,2,17,"Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,"
45,2,18,"And know his will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;"
45,2,19,"And are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,"
45,2,20,"An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which have the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law."
45,2,21,"You therefore which teach another, teach you not yourself? you that preach a man should not steal, do you steal?"
45,2,22,"You that say a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? you that abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?"
45,2,23,"You that make your boast of the law, through breaking the law do you dishonor God?"
45,2,24,"For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written."
45,2,25,"For circumcision truthfully profits, if you keep the law: but if you be a breaker of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision."
45,2,26,"Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?"
45,2,27,"And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?"
45,2,28,"For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:"
45,2,29,"But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God."
45,3,1,"What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?"
45,3,2,"Much every way: chiefly, because unto them were committed the oracles of God."
45,3,3,"For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?"
45,3,4,"God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged."
45,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)"
45,3,6,"God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?"
45,3,7,"For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?"
45,3,8,"And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just."
45,3,9,"What then? are we better than they? No, in no way: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;"
45,3,10,"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"
45,3,11,"There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God."
45,3,12,"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one."
45,3,13,"Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:"
45,3,14,"Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:"
45,3,15,"Their feet are swift to shed blood:"
45,3,16,"Destruction and misery are in their ways:"
45,3,17,"And the way of peace have they not known:"
45,3,18,"There is no fear of God before their eyes."
45,3,19,"Now we know that what things soever the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God."
45,3,20,"Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin."
45,3,21,"But now the righteousness of God outside the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;"
45,3,22,"Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:"
45,3,23,"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"
45,3,24,"Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:"
45,3,25,"Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;"
45,3,26,"To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus."
45,3,27,"Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith."
45,3,28,"Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith outside the deeds of the law."
45,3,29,"Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:"
45,3,30,"Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith."
45,3,31,"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the law."
45,4,1,"What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?"
45,4,2,"For if Abraham were justified by works, he has whereof to glory; but not before God."
45,4,3,"For what says the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness."
45,4,4,"Now to him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt."
45,4,5,"But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."
45,4,6,"Just as David also describes the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputes righteousness without works,"
45,4,7,"Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered."
45,4,8,"Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin."
45,4,9,"Comes this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness."
45,4,10,"How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision."
45,4,11,"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:"
45,4,12,"And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised."
45,4,13,"For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."
45,4,14,"For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of no effect:"
45,4,15,"Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression."
45,4,16,"Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,"
45,4,17,"(As it is written, I have made you a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead, and calls those things which be not as though they were."
45,4,18,"Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall your seed be."
45,4,19,"And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:"
45,4,20,"He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;"
45,4,21,"And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform."
45,4,22,"And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness."
45,4,23,"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;"
45,4,24,"But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;"
45,4,25,"Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification."
45,5,1,"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:"
45,5,2,"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
45,5,3,"And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience;"
45,5,4,"And patience, experience; and experience, hope:"
45,5,5,"And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."
45,5,6,"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly."
45,5,7,"For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die."
45,5,8,"But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
45,5,9,"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."
45,5,10,"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life."
45,5,11,"And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement."
45,5,12,"Therefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:"
45,5,13,"(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law."
45,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come."
45,5,15,"But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded unto many."
45,5,16,"And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification."
45,5,17,"For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)"
45,5,18,"Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life."
45,5,19,"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."
45,5,20,"Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:"
45,5,21,"That as sin has reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
45,6,2,"God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer in it?"
45,6,3,"Do you not know, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?"
45,6,4,"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
45,6,5,"For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:"
45,6,6,"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin."
45,6,7,"For he that is dead is freed from sin."
45,6,8,"Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:"
45,6,9,"Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him."
45,6,10,"For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he lives, he lives unto God."
45,6,11,"Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,12,"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in the lusts of it."
45,6,13,"Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God."
45,6,14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace."
45,6,15,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."
45,6,16,"Do you not know, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?"
45,6,17,"But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you."
45,6,18,"Being then made free from sin, you became the servants of righteousness."
45,6,19,"I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness."
45,6,20,"For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness."
45,6,21,"What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death."
45,6,22,"But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life."
45,6,23,"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,7,1,"Do you not know, brothers, (for I speak to them that know the law,) that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?"
45,7,2,"For the woman which has a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband."
45,7,3,"So then if, while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man."
45,7,4,"Therefore, my brothers, you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God."
45,7,5,"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death."
45,7,6,"But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead in which we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter."
45,7,7,"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet."
45,7,8,"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of desire. For without the law sin was dead."
45,7,9,"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."
45,7,10,"And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death."
45,7,11,"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me."
45,7,12,"Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."
45,7,13,"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly sinful."
45,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."
45,7,15,"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I."
45,7,16,"If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good."
45,7,17,"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me."
45,7,18,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not."
45,7,19,"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do."
45,7,20,"Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me."
45,7,21,"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me."
45,7,22,"For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:"
45,7,23,"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
45,7,24,"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
45,7,25,"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin."
45,8,1,"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
45,8,2,"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death."
45,8,3,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:"
45,8,4,"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
45,8,5,"For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit."
45,8,6,"For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."
45,8,7,"Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
45,8,8,"So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God."
45,8,9,"But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
45,8,10,"And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness."
45,8,11,"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also give life to your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you."
45,8,12,"Therefore, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh."
45,8,13,"For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live."
45,8,14,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
45,8,15,"For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father."
45,8,16,"The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:"
45,8,17,"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together."
45,8,18,"For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us."
45,8,19,"For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God."
45,8,20,"For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,"
45,8,21,"Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God."
45,8,22,"For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now."
45,8,23,"And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body."
45,8,24,"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?"
45,8,25,"But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it."
45,8,26,"Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
45,8,27,"And he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God."
45,8,28,"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."
45,8,29,"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers."
45,8,30,"Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
45,8,31,"What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?"
45,8,32,"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
45,8,33,"Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies."
45,8,34,"Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us."
45,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
45,8,36,"As it is written, For your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
45,8,37,"No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."
45,8,38,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,"
45,8,39,"Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,9,1,"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,"
45,9,2,"That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart."
45,9,3,"For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:"
45,9,4,"Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;"
45,9,5,"Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen."
45,9,6,"Not as though the word of God has taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:"
45,9,7,"Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall your seed be called."
45,9,8,"That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed."
45,9,9,"For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son."
45,9,10,"And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;"
45,9,11,"(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calls;)"
45,9,12,"It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger."
45,9,13,"As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated."
45,9,14,"What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid."
45,9,15,"For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."
45,9,16,"So then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy."
45,9,17,"For the scripture says unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth."
45,9,18,"Therefore has he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens."
45,9,19,"You will say then unto me, Why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted his will?"
45,9,20,"No but, O man, who are you that replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why have you made me thus?"
45,9,21,"Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?"
45,9,22,"What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:"
45,9,23,"And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had previously prepared unto glory,"
45,9,24,"Even us, whom he has called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?"
45,9,25,"As he says also in Hosea, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved."
45,9,26,"And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, You are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God."
45,9,27,"Isaiah also cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:"
45,9,28,"For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth."
45,9,29,"And as Isaiah said before, Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha."
45,9,30,"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith."
45,9,31,"But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness."
45,9,32,"Why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;"
45,9,33,"As it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stumblingstone and rock of offense: and whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed."
45,10,1,"Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved."
45,10,2,"For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge."
45,10,3,"For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."
45,10,4,"For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes."
45,10,5,"For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them."
45,10,6,"But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)"
45,10,7,"Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)"
45,10,8,"But what says it? The word is close you, even in your mouth, and in your heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;"
45,10,9,"That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved."
45,10,10,"For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
45,10,11,"For the scripture says, Whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed."
45,10,12,"For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him."
45,10,13,"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
45,10,14,"How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?"
45,10,15,"And how shall they preach, unless they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!"
45,10,16,"But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?"
45,10,17,"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."
45,10,18,"But I say, Have they not heard? yes truthfully, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world."
45,10,19,"But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you."
45,10,20,"But Isaiah is very bold, and says, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me."
45,10,21,"But to Israel he says, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and opposing people."
45,11,1,"I say then, Has God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."
45,11,2,"God has not cast away his people which he foreknew. Don't you know what the scripture says of Elijah? how he makes intercession to God against Israel saying,"
45,11,3,"Lord, they have killed your prophets, and dug down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."
45,11,4,"But what says the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal."
45,11,5,"Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace."
45,11,6,"And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work."
45,11,7,"What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded."
45,11,8,"(According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day."
45,11,9,"And David says, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompense unto them:"
45,11,10,"Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always."
45,11,11,"I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy."
45,11,12,"Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?"
45,11,13,"For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:"
45,11,14,"If by any means I may provoke to emulation those who are my flesh, and might save some of them."
45,11,15,"For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?"
45,11,16,"For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches."
45,11,17,"And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;"
45,11,18,"Boast not against the branches. But if you boast, you do not bear the root, but the root bears you."
45,11,19,"You will say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in."
45,11,20,"Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Be not high minded, but fear:"
45,11,21,"For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not you."
45,11,22,"Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise you also shall be cut off."
45,11,23,"And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again."
45,11,24,"For if you wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?"
45,11,25,"For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in."
45,11,26,"And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:"
45,11,27,"For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins."
45,11,28,"As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes."
45,11,29,"For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance."
45,11,30,"For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:"
45,11,31,"Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy."
45,11,32,"For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all."
45,11,33,"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!"
45,11,34,"For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been his counselor?"
45,11,35,"Or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?"
45,11,36,"For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory forever. Amen."
45,12,1,"I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies as living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service."
45,12,2,"And be not conformed to this world: but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."
45,12,3,"For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith."
45,12,4,"For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same function:"
45,12,5,"So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another."
45,12,6,"Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;"
45,12,7,"Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teaches, on teaching;"
45,12,8,"Or he that exhorts, on exhortation: he that gives, let him do it with simplicity; he that rules, with diligence; he that shows mercy, with cheerfulness."
45,12,9,"Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good."
45,12,10,"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another;"
45,12,11,"Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;"
45,12,12,"Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;"
45,12,13,"Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality."
45,12,14,"Bless those who persecute you: bless, and curse not."
45,12,15,"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."
45,12,16,"Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits."
45,12,17,"Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men."
45,12,18,"If it be possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men."
45,12,19,"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord."
45,12,20,"Therefore if your enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head."
45,12,21,"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."
45,13,1,"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."
45,13,2,"Whosoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation."
45,13,3,"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt you then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same:"
45,13,4,"For he is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil."
45,13,5,"Therefore you must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake."
45,13,6,"For this cause pay you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing."
45,13,7,"Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor."
45,13,8,"Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law."
45,13,9,"For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
45,13,10,"Love works no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."
45,13,11,"And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed."
45,13,12,"The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."
45,13,13,"Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in lewdness and wantonness, not in strife and envying."
45,13,14,"But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts of it."
45,14,1,"Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful disputations."
45,14,2,"For one believes that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eats herbs."
45,14,3,"Let not him that eats despise him that eats not; and let not him which eats not judge him that eats: for God has received him."
45,14,4,"Who are you that judges another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls. Yes, he shall be held up: for God is able to make him stand."
45,14,5,"One man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind."
45,14,6,"He that regards the day, regards it unto the Lord; and he that regards not the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that eats not, to the Lord he eats not, and gives God thanks."
45,14,7,"For none of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself."
45,14,8,"For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's."
45,14,9,"For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living."
45,14,10,"But why do you judge your brother? or why do you set at nought your brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ."
45,14,11,"For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God."
45,14,12,"So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God."
45,14,13,"Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way."
45,14,14,"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean."
45,14,15,"But if your brother be grieved with your food, now you do not walk charitably. Do not destroy him with your food, for whom Christ died."
45,14,16,"Let not then your good be evil spoken of:"
45,14,17,"For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."
45,14,18,"For he that in these things serves Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men."
45,14,19,"Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things with which one may edify another."
45,14,20,"For food destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eats with offense."
45,14,21,"It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak."
45,14,22,"Have you faith? have it to yourself before God. Happy is he that condemns not himself in that thing which he allows."
45,14,23,"And he that doubts is damned if he eat, because he eats not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin."
45,15,1,"We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves."
45,15,2,"Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification."
45,15,3,"For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached you fell on me."
45,15,4,"For whatsoever things were written earlier were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope."
45,15,5,"Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:"
45,15,6,"That you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
45,15,7,"Therefore receive you one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God."
45,15,8,"Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:"
45,15,9,"And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to you among the Gentiles, and sing unto your name."
45,15,10,"And again he says, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people."
45,15,11,"And again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; and laud him, all you people."
45,15,12,"And again, Isaiah says, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust."
45,15,13,"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost."
45,15,14,"And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another."
45,15,15,"Nevertheless, brothers, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,"
45,15,16,"That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost."
45,15,17,"I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God."
45,15,18,"For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,"
45,15,19,"Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ."
45,15,20,"Yes, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:"
45,15,21,"But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand."
45,15,22,"For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you."
45,15,23,"But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;"
45,15,24,"Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way to there by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company."
45,15,25,"But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints."
45,15,26,"For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem."
45,15,27,"It has pleased them truthfully; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things."
45,15,28,"When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain."
45,15,29,"And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ."
45,15,30,"Now I beseech you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;"
45,15,31,"That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;"
45,15,32,"That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed."
45,15,33,"Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen."
45,16,1,"I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:"
45,16,2,"That you receive her in the Lord, as becomes saints, and that you assist her in whatsoever business she has need of you: for she has been a helper of many, and of myself also."
45,16,3,"Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:"
45,16,4,"Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles."
45,16,5,"Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the first fruits of Achaia unto Christ."
45,16,6,"Greet Mary, who bestowed much labor on us."
45,16,7,"Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me."
45,16,8,"Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord."
45,16,9,"Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved."
45,16,10,"Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute those who are of Aristobulus' household."
45,16,11,"Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord."
45,16,12,"Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which labored much in the Lord."
45,16,13,"Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine."
45,16,14,"Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers which are with them."
45,16,15,"Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them."
45,16,16,"Salute one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you."
45,16,17,"Now I beseech you, brothers, mark those who cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; and avoid them."
45,16,18,"For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple."
45,16,19,"For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil."
45,16,20,"And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen."
45,16,21,"Timotheus my fellow worker, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you."
45,16,22,"I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord."
45,16,23,"Gaius my host, and of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother."
45,16,24,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen."
45,16,25,"Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,"
45,16,26,"But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:"
45,16,27,"To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen."
46,1,1,"Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,"
46,1,2,"Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's:"
46,1,3,"Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
46,1,4,"I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;"
46,1,5,"That in everything you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;"
46,1,6,"Just as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:"
46,1,7,"So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
46,1,8,"Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
46,1,9,"God is faithful, by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord."
46,1,10,"Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
46,1,11,"For it has been declared unto me of you, my brothers, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you."
46,1,12,"Now this I say, that each of you says, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ."
46,1,13,"Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?"
46,1,14,"I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;"
46,1,15,"Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name."
46,1,16,"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other."
46,1,17,"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect."
46,1,18,"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God."
46,1,19,"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
46,1,20,"Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?"
46,1,21,"For after in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom did not know God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
46,1,22,"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:"
46,1,23,"But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness;"
46,1,24,"But unto those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
46,1,25,"Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
46,1,26,"For you see your calling, brothers, that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:"
46,1,27,"But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;"
46,1,28,"And base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:"
46,1,29,"That no flesh should glory in his presence."
46,1,30,"But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:"
46,1,31,"That, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord."
46,2,1,"And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God."
46,2,2,"For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
46,2,3,"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."
46,2,4,"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:"
46,2,5,"That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
46,2,6,"Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:"
46,2,7,"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:"
46,2,8,"Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
46,2,9,"But as it is written, eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him."
46,2,10,"But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God."
46,2,11,"For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God."
46,2,12,"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God."
46,2,13,"Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Ghost teaches; comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
46,2,14,"But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."
46,2,15,"But he that is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged of no man."
46,2,16,"For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."
46,3,1,"And I, brothers, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, just as unto babes in Christ."
46,3,2,"I have fed you with milk, and not with food: for until now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able."
46,3,3,"For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?"
46,3,4,"For while one says, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are you not carnal?"
46,3,5,"Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, just as the Lord gave to every man?"
46,3,6,"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase."
46,3,7,"So then neither is he that plants any thing, neither he that waters; but God that gives the increase."
46,3,8,"Now he that plants and he that waters are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor."
46,3,9,"For we are laborers together with God: you are God's husbandry, you are God's building."
46,3,10,"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon."
46,3,11,"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
46,3,12,"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;"
46,3,13,"Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is."
46,3,14,"If any man's work abide which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward."
46,3,15,"If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire."
46,3,16,"Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?"
46,3,17,"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are."
46,3,18,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
46,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness."
46,3,20,"And again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
46,3,21,"Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;"
46,3,22,"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;"
46,3,23,"And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's."
46,4,1,"Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God."
46,4,2,"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."
46,4,3,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yes, I judge not my own self."
46,4,4,"For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges me is the Lord."
46,4,5,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God."
46,4,6,"And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another."
46,4,7,"For who makes you to differ from another? and what have you that you did not receive? now if you did receive it, why do you glory, as if you had not received it?"
46,4,8,"Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you."
46,4,9,"For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men."
46,4,10,"We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are despised."
46,4,11,"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place;"
46,4,12,"And labor, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we tolerate it:"
46,4,13,"Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day."
46,4,14,"I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you."
46,4,15,"For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."
46,4,16,"Therefore I beseech you, be followers of me."
46,4,17,"For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church."
46,4,18,"Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you."
46,4,19,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of those who are puffed up, but the power."
46,4,20,"For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power."
46,4,21,"What will you? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?"
46,5,1,"It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife."
46,5,2,"And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you."
46,5,3,"For I truthfully, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,"
46,5,4,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
46,5,5,"To deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
46,5,6,"Your glorying is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?"
46,5,7,"Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:"
46,5,8,"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
46,5,9,"I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:"
46,5,10,"yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world."
46,5,11,"But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no not to eat."
46,5,12,"For what have I to do to judge them also that are outside? do not you judge them that are within?"
46,5,13,"But them that are outside God judges. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person."
46,6,1,"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?"
46,6,2,"Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
46,6,3,"Do you not know that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?"
46,6,4,"If then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church."
46,6,5,"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brothers?"
46,6,6,"But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers."
46,6,7,"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because you go to law one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? why do you not rather permit yourselves to be defrauded?"
46,6,8,"No, you do wrong, and defraud, and that your brothers."
46,6,9,"Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,"
46,6,10,"Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."
46,6,11,"And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."
46,6,12,"All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."
46,6,13,"Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body."
46,6,14,"And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power."
46,6,15,"Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid."
46,6,16,"What? do you not know that he which is joined to a harlot is one body? for two, says he, shall be one flesh."
46,6,17,"But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."
46,6,18,"Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body; but he that commits fornication sins against his own body."
46,6,19,"What? do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?"
46,6,20,"For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."
46,7,1,"Now concerning the things whereof you wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman."
46,7,2,"Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."
46,7,3,"Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband."
46,7,4,"The wife has not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband has not power of his own body, but the wife."
46,7,5,"Defraud you not one the other, unless it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your lack of self control."
46,7,6,"But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment."
46,7,7,"For I would that all men were just as I myself. But every man has his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that."
46,7,8,"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide just as I."
46,7,9,"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn."
46,7,10,"And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:"
46,7,11,"But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife."
46,7,12,"But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away."
46,7,13,"And the woman which has a husband that believes not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him."
46,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy."
46,7,15,"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace."
46,7,16,"For what know you, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? or how know you, O man, whether you shall save your wife?"
46,7,17,"But as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches."
46,7,18,"Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised."
46,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."
46,7,20,"Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called."
46,7,21,"Are you called being a servant? care not for it: but if you may be made free, use it rather."
46,7,22,"For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant."
46,7,23,"You are bought with a price; be not you the servants of men."
46,7,24,"Brethren, let every man, in which he is called, in it abide with God."
46,7,25,"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful."
46,7,26,"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be."
46,7,27,"Are you bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? seek not a wife."
46,7,28,"But and if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you."
46,7,29,"But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;"
46,7,30,"And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;"
46,7,31,"And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away."
46,7,32,"But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:"
46,7,33,"But he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife."
46,7,34,"There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband."
46,7,35,"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction."
46,7,36,"But if any man think that he behaves himself improperly toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sins not: let them marry."
46,7,37,"Nevertheless he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well."
46,7,38,"So then he that gives her in marriage does well; but he that gives her not in marriage does better."
46,7,39,"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord."
46,7,40,"But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God."
46,8,1,"Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies."
46,8,2,"And if any man think that he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know."
46,8,3,"But if any man love God, the same is known of him."
46,8,4,"As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one."
46,8,5,"For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)"
46,8,6,"But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him."
46,8,7,"Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled."
46,8,8,"But food commends us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse."
46,8,9,"But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak."
46,8,10,"For if any man see you who have knowledge sit at food in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;"
46,8,11,"And through your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
46,8,12,"But when you sin so against the brothers, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ."
46,8,13,"Therefore, if food make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend."
46,9,1,"Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?"
46,9,2,"If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are you in the Lord."
46,9,3,"Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,"
46,9,4,"Have we not power to eat and to drink?"
46,9,5,"Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?"
46,9,6,"Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?"
46,9,7,"Who goes a warfare any time at his own charges? who plants a vineyard, and eats not of the fruit of it? or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?"
46,9,8,"Say I these things as a man? or says not the law the same also?"
46,9,9,"For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn. Does God take care for oxen?"
46,9,10,"Or says he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that plows should plow in hope; and that he that threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope."
46,9,11,"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?"
46,9,12,"If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but tolerate all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ."
46,9,13,"Do you not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?"
46,9,14,"Even so has the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel."
46,9,15,"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void."
46,9,16,"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yes, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!"
46,9,17,"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me."
46,9,18,"What is my reward then? truthfully that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel."
46,9,19,"For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more."
46,9,20,"And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;"
46,9,21,"To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law."
46,9,22,"To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."
46,9,23,"And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker of it with you."
46,9,24,"Do you not know that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain."
46,9,25,"And every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible."
46,9,26,"I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beats the air:"
46,9,27,"But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."
46,10,1,"Moreover, brothers, I would not that you should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"
46,10,2,"And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;"
46,10,3,"And did all eat the same spiritual food;"
46,10,4,"And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ."
46,10,5,"But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness."
46,10,6,"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted."
46,10,7,"Neither be idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
46,10,8,"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand."
46,10,9,"Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents."
46,10,10,"Neither murmur you, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer."
46,10,11,"Now all these things happened unto them for examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come."
46,10,12,"Therefore let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall."
46,10,13,"There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not permit you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it."
46,10,14,"Therefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry."
46,10,15,"I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say."
46,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
46,10,17,"For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread."
46,10,18,"Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?"
46,10,19,"What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?"
46,10,20,"But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils."
46,10,21,"You cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils."
46,10,22,"Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?"
46,10,23,"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not."
46,10,24,"Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth."
46,10,25,"Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:"
46,10,26,"For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it."
46,10,27,"If any of them that believe not invite you to a feast, and you be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake."
46,10,28,"But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it:"
46,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not your own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?"
46,10,30,"For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
46,10,31,"Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God."
46,10,32,"Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:"
46,10,33,"Just as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved."
46,11,1,"Be you followers of me, just as I also am of Christ."
46,11,2,"Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you."
46,11,3,"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God."
46,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head."
46,11,5,"But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven."
46,11,6,"For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered."
46,11,7,"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man."
46,11,8,"For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man."
46,11,9,"Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man."
46,11,10,"For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels."
46,11,11,"Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord."
46,11,12,"For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God."
46,11,13,"Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?"
46,11,14,"Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?"
46,11,15,"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering."
46,11,16,"But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God."
46,11,17,"Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse."
46,11,18,"For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it."
46,11,19,"For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you."
46,11,20,"When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper."
46,11,21,"For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken."
46,11,22,"What? have you not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise you the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not."
46,11,23,"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:"
46,11,24,"And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said,"
46,11,25,"After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying,"
46,11,26,"For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come."
46,11,27,"Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."
46,11,28,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup."
46,11,29,"For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body."
46,11,30,"For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep."
46,11,31,"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
46,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world."
46,11,33,"Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, tarry one for another."
46,11,34,"And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come."
46,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant."
46,12,2,"You know that you were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, just as you were led."
46,12,3,"Therefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."
46,12,4,"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."
46,12,5,"And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord."
46,12,6,"And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which works all in all."
46,12,7,"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man for the profit of all."
46,12,8,"For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;"
46,12,9,"To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;"
46,12,10,"To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:"
46,12,11,"But all these works that one and the very same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will."
46,12,12,"For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ."
46,12,13,"For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."
46,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
46,12,15,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
46,12,16,"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
46,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?"
46,12,18,"But now has God set the members every one of them in the body, as it has pleased him."
46,12,19,"And if they were all one member, where were the body?"
46,12,20,"But now are they many members, yet but one body."
46,12,21,"And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of you: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
46,12,22,"No, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:"
46,12,23,"And those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness."
46,12,24,"For our comely parts have no need: but God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked."
46,12,25,"That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another."
46,12,26,"And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it."
46,12,27,"Now you are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
46,12,28,"And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues."
46,12,29,"Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?"
46,12,30,"Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?"
46,12,31,"But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I unto you a more excellent way."
46,13,1,"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."
46,13,2,"And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing."
46,13,3,"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profits me nothing."
46,13,4,"Love suffers long, and is kind; love envies not; love vaunts not itself, is not puffed up,"
46,13,5,"Does not behave itself unseemly, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;"
46,13,6,"Rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;"
46,13,7,"Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."
46,13,8,"Love never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away."
46,13,9,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part."
46,13,10,"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."
46,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."
46,13,12,"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know just as also I am known."
46,13,13,"And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love."
46,14,1,"Follow after love, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy."
46,14,2,"For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not unto men, but unto God: for no man understands him; howbeit in the spirit he speaks mysteries."
46,14,3,"But he that prophesies speaks unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort."
46,14,4,"He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church."
46,14,5,"I would that you all spoke with tongues but rather that you prophesied: for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, unless he interpret, that the church may receive edifying."
46,14,6,"Now, brothers, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?"
46,14,7,"And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, unless they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?"
46,14,8,"For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?"
46,14,9,"So likewise you, unless you utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for you shall speak into the air."
46,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification."
46,14,11,"Therefore if I do not know the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian unto me."
46,14,12,"Even so you, forasmuch as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church."
46,14,13,"Therefore let him that speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret."
46,14,14,"For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful."
46,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."
46,14,16,"Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he does not understand what you say?"
46,14,17,"For you truthfully give thanks well, but the other is not edified."
46,14,18,"I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:"
46,14,19,"yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."
46,14,20,"Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be you children, but in understanding be men."
46,14,21,"In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, says the LORD."
46,14,22,"Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serves not for them that believe not, but for those who believe."
46,14,23,"If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?"
46,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:"
46,14,25,"And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth."
46,14,26,"How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying."
46,14,27,"If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret."
46,14,28,"But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God."
46,14,29,"Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge."
46,14,30,"If any thing be revealed to another that sits by, let the first hold his peace."
46,14,31,"For you may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted."
46,14,32,"And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets."
46,14,33,"For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints."
46,14,34,"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also says the law."
46,14,35,"And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."
46,14,36,"What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?"
46,14,37,"If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord."
46,14,38,"But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant."
46,14,39,"Therefore, brothers, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues."
46,14,40,"Let all things be done decently and in order."
46,15,1,"Moreover, brothers, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also you have received, and in which you stand;"
46,15,2,"By which also you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain."
46,15,3,"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;"
46,15,4,"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:"
46,15,5,"And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:"
46,15,6,"After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep."
46,15,7,"After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles."
46,15,8,"And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time."
46,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not suitable to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
46,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
46,15,11,"Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so you believed."
46,15,12,"Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
46,15,13,"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:"
46,15,14,"And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain."
46,15,15,"Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not."
46,15,16,"For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:"
46,15,17,"And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins."
46,15,18,"Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished."
46,15,19,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable."
46,15,20,"But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept."
46,15,21,"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead."
46,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
46,15,23,"But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming."
46,15,24,"Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power."
46,15,25,"For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet."
46,15,26,"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."
46,15,27,"For he has put all things under his feet. But when he says all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him."
46,15,28,"And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."
46,15,29,"Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?"
46,15,30,"And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?"
46,15,31,"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily."
46,15,32,"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantages it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die."
46,15,33,"Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners."
46,15,34,"Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame."
46,15,35,"But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?"
46,15,36,"You fool, that which you sow is not given life, unless it die:"
46,15,37,"And that which you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but bore grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:"
46,15,38,"But God gives it a body as it has pleased him, and to every seed his own body."
46,15,39,"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds."
46,15,40,"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another."
46,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differs from another star in glory."
46,15,42,"So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:"
46,15,43,"It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:"
46,15,44,"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."
46,15,45,"And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a life-giving spirit."
46,15,46,"Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual."
46,15,47,"The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven."
46,15,48,"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly."
46,15,49,"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."
46,15,50,"Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption."
46,15,51,"Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,"
46,15,52,"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
46,15,53,"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."
46,15,54,"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
46,15,55,"O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?"
46,15,56,"The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law."
46,15,57,"But thanks be to God, which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
46,15,58,"Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord."
46,16,1,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you."
46,16,2,"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come."
46,16,3,"And when I come, whomsoever you shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem."
46,16,4,"And if it be suitable that I go also, they shall go with me."
46,16,5,"Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia."
46,16,6,"And it may be that I will abide, yes, and winter with you, that you may bring me on my journey to wheresoever I go."
46,16,7,"For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit."
46,16,8,"But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost."
46,16,9,"For a great and effective door is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries."
46,16,10,"Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do."
46,16,11,"Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brothers."
46,16,12,"As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time."
46,16,13,"Watch you, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong."
46,16,14,"Let all your things be done with love."
46,16,15,"I beseech you, brothers, (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)"
46,16,16,"That you submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helps with us, and labors."
46,16,17,"I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied."
46,16,18,"For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge you them that are such."
46,16,19,"The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."
46,16,20,"All the brothers greet you. Greet you one another with a holy kiss."
46,16,21,"The salutation of me Paul with my own hand."
46,16,22,"If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha."
46,16,23,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."
46,16,24,"My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen."
47,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:"
47,1,2,"Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
47,1,3,"Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;"
47,1,4,"Who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, by the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted of God."
47,1,5,"For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ."
47,1,6,"And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effective in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation."
47,1,7,"And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation."
47,1,8,"For we would not, brothers, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:"
47,1,9,"But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead:"
47,1,10,"Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;"
47,1,11,"You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf."
47,1,12,"For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conduct in the world, and more abundantly toward you."
47,1,13,"For we write none other things unto you, than what you read or acknowledge; and I trust you shall acknowledge even to the end;"
47,1,14,"As also you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus."
47,1,15,"And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that you might have a second benefit;"
47,1,16,"And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea."
47,1,17,"When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and no no?"
47,1,18,"But as God is true, our word toward you was not yes and no."
47,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes."
47,1,20,"For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us."
47,1,21,"Now he which establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God;"
47,1,22,"Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
47,1,23,"Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth."
47,1,24,"Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith you stand."
47,2,1,"But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness."
47,2,2,"For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?"
47,2,3,"And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all."
47,2,4,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you."
47,2,5,"But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all."
47,2,6,"Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many."
47,2,7,"So that contrariwise you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow."
47,2,8,"Therefore I beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him."
47,2,9,"For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things."
47,2,10,"To whom you forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;"
47,2,11,"Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices."
47,2,12,"Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,"
47,2,13,"I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia."
47,2,14,"Now thanks be unto God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place."
47,2,15,"For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:"
47,2,16,"To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?"
47,2,17,"For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ."
47,3,1,"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?"
47,3,2,"You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:"
47,3,3,"Since as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart."
47,3,4,"And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:"
47,3,5,"Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;"
47,3,6,"Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life."
47,3,7,"But if the ministration of death, written and engraved in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:"
47,3,8,"How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?"
47,3,9,"For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more does the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory."
47,3,10,"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excels."
47,3,11,"For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remains is glorious."
47,3,12,"Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:"
47,3,13,"And not as Moses, which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:"
47,3,14,"But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which veil is done away in Christ."
47,3,15,"But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart."
47,3,16,"Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away."
47,3,17,"Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
47,3,18,"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the LORD."
47,4,1,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;"
47,4,2,"But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."
47,4,3,"But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:"
47,4,4,"In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of those who believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."
47,4,5,"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake."
47,4,6,"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
47,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."
47,4,8,"We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;"
47,4,9,"Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;"
47,4,10,"Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body."
47,4,11,"For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh."
47,4,12,"So then death works in us, but life in you."
47,4,13,"We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;"
47,4,14,"Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you."
47,4,15,"For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God."
47,4,16,"For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day."
47,4,17,"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceedingly and eternal weight of glory;"
47,4,18,"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."
47,5,1,"For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
47,5,2,"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:"
47,5,3,"If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked."
47,5,4,"For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."
47,5,5,"Now he that has wrought us for the very same thing is God, who also has given unto us the earnest of the Spirit."
47,5,6,"Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:"
47,5,7,"(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)"
47,5,8,"We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord."
47,5,9,"Therefore we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him."
47,5,10,"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad."
47,5,11,"Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences."
47,5,12,"For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer those who glory in appearance, and not in heart."
47,5,13,"For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause."
47,5,14,"For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:"
47,5,15,"And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again."
47,5,16,"Therefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yes, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more."
47,5,17,"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things have become new."
47,5,18,"And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;"
47,5,19,"That is, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation."
47,5,20,"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be reconciled to God."
47,5,21,"For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
47,6,1,"We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain."
47,6,2,"(For he says, I have heard you in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I helped you: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)"
47,6,3,"Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:"
47,6,4,"But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,"
47,6,5,"In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;"
47,6,6,"By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,"
47,6,7,"By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,"
47,6,8,"By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;"
47,6,9,"As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;"
47,6,10,"As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."
47,6,11,"O you Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged."
47,6,12,"You are not restricted in us, but you are restricted in your own insides."
47,6,13,"Now for a recompense in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be you also enlarged."
47,6,14,"Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?"
47,6,15,"And what concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that believes with an infidel?"
47,6,16,"And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
47,6,17,"Therefore come out from among them, and be separate, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you."
47,6,18,"And will be a Father unto you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty."
47,7,1,"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
47,7,2,"Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man."
47,7,3,"I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die and live with you."
47,7,4,"Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation."
47,7,5,"For, when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; outside were fightings, within were fears."
47,7,6,"Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;"
47,7,7,"And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more."
47,7,8,"For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle has made you sorry, though it were but for a season."
47,7,9,"Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing."
47,7,10,"For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world works death."
47,7,11,"For behold this very same thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge! In all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter."
47,7,12,"Therefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you."
47,7,13,"Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more we rejoiced for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all."
47,7,14,"For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth."
47,7,15,"And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, while he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him."
47,7,16,"I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things."
47,8,1,"Moreover, brothers, we do you to know of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;"
47,8,2,"That in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality."
47,8,3,"For to their power, I bear record, yes, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;"
47,8,4,"Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints."
47,8,5,"And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God."
47,8,6,"Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also."
47,8,7,"Therefore, as you abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that you abound in this grace also."
47,8,8,"I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love."
47,8,9,"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be rich."
47,8,10,"And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago."
47,8,11,"Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which you have."
47,8,12,"For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man has, and not according to that he has not."
47,8,13,"For I mean not that other men be eased, and you burdened:"
47,8,14,"But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:"
47,8,15,"As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack."
47,8,16,"But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you."
47,8,17,"For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you."
47,8,18,"And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;"
47,8,19,"And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:"
47,8,20,"Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:"
47,8,21,"Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
47,8,22,"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you."
47,8,23,"Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ."
47,8,24,"Therefore show you to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf."
47,9,1,"For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:"
47,9,2,"For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many."
47,9,3,"yet have I sent the brothers, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, you may be ready:"
47,9,4,"Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting."
47,9,5,"Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof you had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness."
47,9,6,"But this I say, He which sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully."
47,9,7,"Every man according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver."
47,9,8,"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:"
47,9,9,"(As it is written, He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor: his righteousness remains forever."
47,9,10,"Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)"
47,9,11,"Being enriched in everything to all bountifulness, which causes through us thanksgiving to God."
47,9,12,"For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;"
47,9,13,"Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;"
47,9,14,"And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceedingly grace of God in you."
47,9,15,"Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift."
47,10,1,"Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:"
47,10,2,"But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh."
47,10,3,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:"
47,10,4,"(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds;)"
47,10,5,"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;"
47,10,6,"And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled."
47,10,7,"Do you look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's."
47,10,8,"For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:"
47,10,9,"That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters."
47,10,10,"For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible."
47,10,11,"Let such a one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present."
47,10,12,"For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."
47,10,13,"But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God has distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you."
47,10,14,"For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:"
47,10,15,"Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,"
47,10,16,"To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand."
47,10,17,"But he that glories, let him glory in the Lord."
47,10,18,"For not he that commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends."
47,11,1,"Would to God you could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me."
47,11,2,"For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ."
47,11,3,"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his trickery, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."
47,11,4,"For if he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit, which you have not received, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you might well bear with him."
47,11,5,"For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles."
47,11,6,"But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things."
47,11,7,"Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?"
47,11,8,"I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service."
47,11,9,"And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself."
47,11,10,"As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia."
47,11,11,"Why? because I love you not? God knows."
47,11,12,"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from those who desire occasion; that in which they glory, they may be found just as we."
47,11,13,"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ."
47,11,14,"And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light."
47,11,15,"Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works."
47,11,16,"I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little."
47,11,17,"That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting."
47,11,18,"Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also."
47,11,19,"For you tolerate fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise."
47,11,20,"For you suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face."
47,11,21,"I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit in whichsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also."
47,11,22,"Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I."
47,11,23,"Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often."
47,11,24,"Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes less one."
47,11,25,"Three times was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, three times I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;"
47,11,26,"In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brothers;"
47,11,27,"In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness."
47,11,28,"Beside those things that are outside, that which comes upon me daily, the care of all the churches."
47,11,29,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?"
47,11,30,"If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities."
47,11,31,"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knows that I lie not."
47,11,32,"In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:"
47,11,33,"And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands."
47,12,1,"It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord."
47,12,2,"I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such a one caught up to the third heaven."
47,12,3,"And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;)"
47,12,4,"That he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."
47,12,5,"Of such a one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities."
47,12,6,"For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I hold back, lest any man should think of me above that which he sees me to be, or that he hears of me."
47,12,7,"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure."
47,12,8,"For this thing I asked the Lord three times, that it might depart from me."
47,12,9,"And he said unto me,"
47,12,10,"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong."
47,12,11,"I am become a fool in glorying; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing."
47,12,12,"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds."
47,12,13,"For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong."
47,12,14,"Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
47,12,15,"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved."
47,12,16,"But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile."
47,12,17,"Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?"
47,12,18,"I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?"
47,12,19,"Again, think you that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying."
47,12,20,"For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as you would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:"
47,12,21,"And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed."
47,13,1,"This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."
47,13,2,"I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to those who heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:"
47,13,3,"Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you."
47,13,4,"For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you."
47,13,5,"Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves. Do you not know your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you be reprobates?"
47,13,6,"But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates."
47,13,7,"Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates."
47,13,8,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
47,13,9,"For we are glad, when we are weak, and you are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection."
47,13,10,"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction."
47,13,11,"Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you."
47,13,12,"Greet one another with a holy kiss."
47,13,13,"All the saints salute you."
47,13,14,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen."
48,1,1,"Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)"
48,1,2,"And all the brothers which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:"
48,1,3,"Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,"
48,1,4,"Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:"
48,1,5,"To whom be glory forever and ever. Amen."
48,1,6,"I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:"
48,1,7,"Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ."
48,1,8,"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."
48,1,9,"As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received, let him be accursed."
48,1,10,"For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ."
48,1,11,"But I certify you, brothers, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man."
48,1,12,"For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."
48,1,13,"For you have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:"
48,1,14,"And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers."
48,1,15,"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,"
48,1,16,"To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:"
48,1,17,"Neither went I up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus."
48,1,18,"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days."
48,1,19,"But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother."
48,1,20,"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not."
48,1,21,"Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;"
48,1,22,"And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:"
48,1,23,"But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed."
48,1,24,"And they glorified God in me."
48,2,1,"Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also."
48,2,2,"And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain."
48,2,3,"But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:"
48,2,4,"And that because of false brothers unawares brought in, who came in secretly to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:"
48,2,5,"To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you."
48,2,6,"But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:"
48,2,7,"But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;"
48,2,8,"(For he that wrought effectively in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)"
48,2,9,"And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision."
48,2,10,"Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was eager to do."
48,2,11,"But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed."
48,2,12,"For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they had come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision."
48,2,13,"And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation."
48,2,14,"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"
48,2,15,"We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,"
48,2,16,"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."
48,2,17,"But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid."
48,2,18,"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor."
48,2,19,"For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God."
48,2,20,"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."
48,2,21,"I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain."
48,3,1,"O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?"
48,3,2,"This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
48,3,3,"Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect by the flesh?"
48,3,4,"Have you suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain."
48,3,5,"He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
48,3,6,"Just as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."
48,3,7,"Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham."
48,3,8,"And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed."
48,3,9,"So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham."
48,3,10,"For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them."
48,3,11,"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith."
48,3,12,"And the law is not of faith: but, The man that does them shall live in them."
48,3,13,"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:"
48,3,14,"That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
48,3,15,"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannuls, or adds thereto."
48,3,16,"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He says not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ."
48,3,17,"And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of no effect."
48,3,18,"For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise."
48,3,19,"Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator."
48,3,20,"Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one."
48,3,21,"Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truthfully righteousness should have been by the law."
48,3,22,"But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."
48,3,23,"But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed."
48,3,24,"Therefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith."
48,3,25,"But after faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."
48,3,26,"For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus."
48,3,27,"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ."
48,3,28,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
48,3,29,"And if you be Christ's, then are you Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."
48,4,1,"Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;"
48,4,2,"But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father."
48,4,3,"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:"
48,4,4,"But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,"
48,4,5,"To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."
48,4,6,"And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father."
48,4,7,"Therefore you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
48,4,8,"Howbeit then, when you did not know God, you did service unto those who by nature are no gods."
48,4,9,"But now, after you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?"
48,4,10,"You observe days, and months, and times, and years."
48,4,11,"I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain."
48,4,12,"Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as you are: you have not injured me at all."
48,4,13,"You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first."
48,4,14,"And my temptation which was in my flesh you looked down upon not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, just as Christ Jesus."
48,4,15,"Where is then the blessedness you spoke of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me."
48,4,16,"Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?"
48,4,17,"They zealously affect you, but not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you might affect them."
48,4,18,"But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you."
48,4,19,"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,"
48,4,20,"I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you."
48,4,21,"Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?"
48,4,22,"For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman."
48,4,23,"But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise."
48,4,24,"Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which genders to bondage, which is Agar."
48,4,25,"For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children."
48,4,26,"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all."
48,4,27,"For it is written, Rejoice, you barren that bear not; break forth and cry, you that travail not: for the desolate has many more children than she which has a husband."
48,4,28,"Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are the children of promise."
48,4,29,"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now."
48,4,30,"Nevertheless what says the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman."
48,4,31,"So then, brothers, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."
48,5,1,"Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
48,5,2,"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."
48,5,3,"For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
48,5,4,"Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace."
48,5,5,"For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith."
48,5,6,"For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love."
48,5,7,"You did run well; who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?"
48,5,8,"This persuasion comes not of him that calls you."
48,5,9,"A little leaven leavens the whole lump."
48,5,10,"I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be."
48,5,11,"And I, brothers, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased."
48,5,12,"I would they were even cut off which trouble you."
48,5,13,"For, brothers, you have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another."
48,5,14,"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this;"
48,5,15,"But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another."
48,5,16,"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh."
48,5,17,"For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would."
48,5,18,"But if you be led of the Spirit, you are not under the law."
48,5,19,"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,"
48,5,20,"Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,"
48,5,21,"Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
48,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,"
48,5,23,"Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law."
48,5,24,"And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts."
48,5,25,"If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."
48,5,26,"Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another."
48,6,1,"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted."
48,6,2,"Bear you one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ."
48,6,3,"For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
48,6,4,"But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another."
48,6,5,"For every man shall bear his own burden."
48,6,6,"Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teaches in all good things."
48,6,7,"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap."
48,6,8,"For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting."
48,6,9,"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we do not quit."
48,6,10,"As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith."
48,6,11,"You see how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand."
48,6,12,"As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ."
48,6,13,"For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh."
48,6,14,"But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."
48,6,15,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature."
48,6,16,"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God."
48,6,17,"From now on let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."
48,6,18,"Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
49,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:"
49,1,2,"Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
49,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:"
49,1,4,"According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:"
49,1,5,"Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,"
49,1,6,"To the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he has made us accepted in the beloved."
49,1,7,"In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;"
49,1,8,"Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;"
49,1,9,"Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:"
49,1,10,"That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:"
49,1,11,"In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:"
49,1,12,"That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ."
49,1,13,"In whom you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,"
49,1,14,"Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory."
49,1,15,"Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,"
49,1,16,"Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;"
49,1,17,"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:"
49,1,18,"The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,"
49,1,19,"And what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,"
49,1,20,"Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,"
49,1,21,"Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:"
49,1,22,"And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,"
49,1,23,"Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all."
49,2,1,"And you has he given life, who were dead in trespasses and sins;"
49,2,2,"Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:"
49,2,3,"Among whom also we all had our conduct in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, just as others."
49,2,4,"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,"
49,2,5,"Even when we were dead in sins, has given life to us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)"
49,2,6,"And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:"
49,2,7,"That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus."
49,2,8,"For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:"
49,2,9,"Not of works, lest any man should boast."
49,2,10,"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them."
49,2,11,"Therefore remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;"
49,2,12,"That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:"
49,2,13,"But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made close by the blood of Christ."
49,2,14,"For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;"
49,2,15,"Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;"
49,2,16,"And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:"
49,2,17,"And came and preached peace to you who were afar off, and to them that were close."
49,2,18,"For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father."
49,2,19,"Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;"
49,2,20,"And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;"
49,2,21,"In whom all the building fitly framed together grows unto a holy temple in the Lord:"
49,2,22,"In whom you also are builded together for a habitation of God through the Spirit."
49,3,1,"For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,"
49,3,2,"If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me toward you:"
49,3,3,"That by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,"
49,3,4,"Whereby, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)"
49,3,5,"Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;"
49,3,6,"That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:"
49,3,7,"Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effective working of his power."
49,3,8,"Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;"
49,3,9,"And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:"
49,3,10,"To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,"
49,3,11,"According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:"
49,3,12,"In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him."
49,3,13,"Therefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory."
49,3,14,"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
49,3,15,"Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,"
49,3,16,"That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;"
49,3,17,"That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,"
49,3,18,"May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;"
49,3,19,"And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God."
49,3,20,"Now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,"
49,3,21,"Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."
49,4,1,"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,"
49,4,2,"With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;"
49,4,3,"Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
49,4,4,"There is one body, and one Spirit, just as you are called in one hope of your calling;"
49,4,5,"One Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
49,4,6,"One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."
49,4,7,"But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ."
49,4,8,"Therefore he says, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men."
49,4,9,"(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"
49,4,10,"He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)"
49,4,11,"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;"
49,4,12,"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:"
49,4,13,"Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:"
49,4,14,"That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;"
49,4,15,"But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:"
49,4,16,"From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effective working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
49,4,17,"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,"
49,4,18,"Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:"
49,4,19,"Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness."
49,4,20,"But you have not so learned Christ;"
49,4,21,"If so be that you have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:"
49,4,22,"That you put off concerning the former conduct the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;"
49,4,23,"And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;"
49,4,24,"And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."
49,4,25,"Therefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another."
49,4,26,"Be you angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:"
49,4,27,"Neither give place to the devil."
49,4,28,"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs."
49,4,29,"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers."
49,4,30,"And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption."
49,4,31,"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:"
49,4,32,"And be kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you."
49,5,1,"Be you therefore followers of God, as dear children;"
49,5,2,"And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour."
49,5,3,"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;"
49,5,4,"Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not fitting: but rather giving of thanks."
49,5,5,"For this you know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
49,5,6,"Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things comes the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience."
49,5,7,"Be not you therefore partakers with them."
49,5,8,"For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:"
49,5,9,"(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)"
49,5,10,"Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord."
49,5,11,"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them."
49,5,12,"For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret."
49,5,13,"But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever does make manifest is light."
49,5,14,"Therefore he says, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light."
49,5,15,"See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,"
49,5,16,"Redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
49,5,17,"Therefore be you not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is."
49,5,18,"And be not drunk with wine, in which is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;"
49,5,19,"Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;"
49,5,20,"Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
49,5,21,"Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God."
49,5,22,"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord."
49,5,23,"For the husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body."
49,5,24,"Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything."
49,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;"
49,5,26,"That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,"
49,5,27,"That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."
49,5,28,"So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself."
49,5,29,"For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord the church:"
49,5,30,"For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."
49,5,31,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh."
49,5,32,"This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church."
49,5,33,"Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife just as himself; and the wife see that she respect her husband."
49,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right."
49,6,2,"honor your father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;"
49,6,3,"That it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth."
49,6,4,"And, you fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."
49,6,5,"Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;"
49,6,6,"Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;"
49,6,7,"With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:"
49,6,8,"Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free."
49,6,9,"And, you masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him."
49,6,10,"Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might."
49,6,11,"Put on the whole armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
49,6,12,"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."
49,6,13,"Therefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
49,6,14,"Stand therefore, having your loins girded about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;"
49,6,15,"And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;"
49,6,16,"Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."
49,6,17,"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:"
49,6,18,"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;"
49,6,19,"And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,"
49,6,20,"For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
49,6,21,"But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:"
49,6,22,"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that you might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts."
49,6,23,"Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
49,6,24,"Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen."
50,1,1,"Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:"
50,1,2,"Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
50,1,3,"I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,"
50,1,4,"Always in every prayer of my for you all making request with joy,"
50,1,5,"For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;"
50,1,6,"Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:"
50,1,7,"Just as it is suitable for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace."
50,1,8,"For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the insides of Jesus Christ."
50,1,9,"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;"
50,1,10,"That you may approve things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ."
50,1,11,"Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God."
50,1,12,"But I would you should understand, brothers, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;"
50,1,13,"So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;"
50,1,14,"And many of the brothers in the Lord, growing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear."
50,1,15,"Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:"
50,1,16,"The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:"
50,1,17,"But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel."
50,1,18,"What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I in it do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice."
50,1,19,"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"
50,1,20,"According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death."
50,1,21,"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
50,1,22,"But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not."
50,1,23,"For I am in a tight place between the two, having a desire to depart, an to be with Christ; which is far better:"
50,1,24,"Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needed by you."
50,1,25,"And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;"
50,1,26,"That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again."
50,1,27,"Only let your conduct be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;"
50,1,28,"And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God."
50,1,29,"For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;"
50,1,30,"Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me."
50,2,1,"If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any insides and mercies,"
50,2,2,"Fulfill you my joy, that you be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind."
50,2,3,"Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves."
50,2,4,"Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others."
50,2,5,"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:"
50,2,6,"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:"
50,2,7,"But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:"
50,2,8,"And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."
50,2,9,"Therefore God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:"
50,2,10,"That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;"
50,2,11,"And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
50,2,12,"Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
50,2,13,"For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure."
50,2,14,"Do all things without murmurings and disputings:"
50,2,15,"That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;"
50,2,16,"Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain."
50,2,17,"Yes, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all."
50,2,18,"For the same cause also do you joy, and rejoice with me."
50,2,19,"But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state."
50,2,20,"For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state."
50,2,21,"For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's."
50,2,22,"But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel."
50,2,23,"Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me."
50,2,24,"But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly."
50,2,25,"Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants."
50,2,26,"For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that you had heard that he had been sick."
50,2,27,"For indeed he was sick close unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow."
50,2,28,"I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful."
50,2,29,"Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:"
50,2,30,"Because for the work of Christ he was close unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me."
50,3,1,"Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe."
50,3,2,"Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision."
50,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh."
50,3,4,"Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:"
50,3,5,"Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;"
50,3,6,"Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless."
50,3,7,"But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ."
50,3,8,"Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,"
50,3,9,"And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:"
50,3,10,"That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;"
50,3,11,"If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead."
50,3,12,"Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus."
50,3,13,"Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,"
50,3,14,"I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
50,3,15,"Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you."
50,3,16,"Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing."
50,3,17,"Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark those who walk so as you have us for an example."
50,3,18,"(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:"
50,3,19,"Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)"
50,3,20,"For our conduct is in heaven; from where also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:"
50,3,21,"Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself."
50,4,1,"Therefore, my brothers dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved."
50,4,2,"I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord."
50,4,3,"And I entreat you also, true yokefellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life."
50,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice."
50,4,5,"Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand."
50,4,6,"Be anxious for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God."
50,4,7,"And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
50,4,8,"Finally, brothers, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things."
50,4,9,"Those things, which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you."
50,4,10,"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; in which you were also anxious, but you lacked opportunity."
50,4,11,"Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content."
50,4,12,"I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need."
50,4,13,"I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me."
50,4,14,"Notwithstanding you have well done, that you did communicate with my affliction."
50,4,15,"Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only."
50,4,16,"For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again unto my necessity."
50,4,17,"Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account."
50,4,18,"But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God."
50,4,19,"But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus."
50,4,20,"Now unto God and our Father be glory forever and ever. Amen."
50,4,21,"Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers which are with me greet you."
50,4,22,"All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household."
50,4,23,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen."
51,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,"
51,1,2,"To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
51,1,3,"We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
51,1,4,"Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,"
51,1,5,"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;"
51,1,6,"Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:"
51,1,7,"As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;"
51,1,8,"Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit."
51,1,9,"For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;"
51,1,10,"That you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;"
51,1,11,"Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;"
51,1,12,"Giving thanks unto the Father, which has made us suitable to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:"
51,1,13,"Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:"
51,1,14,"In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:"
51,1,15,"Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:"
51,1,16,"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:"
51,1,17,"And he is before all things, and by him all things consist."
51,1,18,"And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence."
51,1,19,"For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;"
51,1,20,"And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven."
51,1,21,"And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled"
51,1,22,"In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:"
51,1,23,"If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;"
51,1,24,"Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:"
51,1,25,"Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;"
51,1,26,"Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:"
51,1,27,"To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:"
51,1,28,"Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:"
51,1,29,"Whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily."
51,2,1,"For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;"
51,2,2,"That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;"
51,2,3,"In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
51,2,4,"And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words."
51,2,5,"For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ."
51,2,6,"As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in him:"
51,2,7,"Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving."
51,2,8,"Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ."
51,2,9,"For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
51,2,10,"And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:"
51,2,11,"In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:"
51,2,12,"Buried with him in baptism, in which also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead."
51,2,13,"And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he given life together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;"
51,2,14,"Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;"
51,2,15,"And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it."
51,2,16,"Let no man therefore judge you in food, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:"
51,2,17,"Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ."
51,2,18,"Let no man beguile you of your reward in a false humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,"
51,2,19,"And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God."
51,2,20,"Therefore if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to ordinances,"
51,2,21,"(Touch not; taste not; handle not;"
51,2,22,"Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?"
51,2,23,"Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh."
51,3,1,"If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God."
51,3,2,"Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."
51,3,3,"For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."
51,3,4,"When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory."
51,3,5,"Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil sexual desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry:"
51,3,6,"For which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience:"
51,3,7,"In which you also walked some time, when you lived in them."
51,3,8,"But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."
51,3,9,"Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;"
51,3,10,"And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:"
51,3,11,"Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all."
51,3,12,"Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, insides of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;"
51,3,13,"Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: just as Christ forgave you, so also do you."
51,3,14,"And above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness."
51,3,15,"And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be you thankful."
51,3,16,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord."
51,3,17,"And whatsoever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him."
51,3,18,"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord."
51,3,19,"Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them."
51,3,20,"Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord."
51,3,21,"Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."
51,3,22,"Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;"
51,3,23,"And whatsoever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;"
51,3,24,"Knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ."
51,3,25,"But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done: and there is no respect of persons."
51,4,1,"Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven."
51,4,2,"Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;"
51,4,3,"Meanwhile praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:"
51,4,4,"That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak."
51,4,5,"Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time."
51,4,6,"Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man."
51,4,7,"All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:"
51,4,8,"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;"
51,4,9,"With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here."
51,4,10,"Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)"
51,4,11,"And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellow workers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me."
51,4,12,"Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God."
51,4,13,"For I bear him record, that he has a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis."
51,4,14,"Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you."
51,4,15,"Salute the brothers which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house."
51,4,16,"And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea."
51,4,17,"And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it."
51,4,18,"The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen."
52,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
52,1,2,"We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;"
52,1,3,"Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;"
52,1,4,"Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God."
52,1,5,"For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake."
52,1,6,"And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost."
52,1,7,"So that you were examples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia."
52,1,8,"For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing."
52,1,9,"For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;"
52,1,10,"And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, which is Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come."
52,2,1,"For yourselves, brothers, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:"
52,2,2,"But even after we had suffered before, and were shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention."
52,2,3,"For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:"
52,2,4,"But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts."
52,2,5,"For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:"
52,2,6,"Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ."
52,2,7,"But we were gentle among you, just as a nurse cherishes her children:"
52,2,8,"So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear unto us."
52,2,9,"For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God."
52,2,10,"You are witnesses, and God also, how devoutly and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:"
52,2,11,"As you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,"
52,2,12,"That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you unto his kingdom and glory."
52,2,13,"For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectively works also in you that believe."
52,2,14,"For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, just as they have of the Jews:"
52,2,15,"Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:"
52,2,16,"Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost."
52,2,17,"But we, brothers, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire."
52,2,18,"Therefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us."
52,2,19,"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?"
52,2,20,"For you are our glory and joy."
52,3,1,"Therefore when we could no longer hold back, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;"
52,3,2,"And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:"
52,3,3,"That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto."
52,3,4,"For truthfully, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; just as it came to pass, and you know."
52,3,5,"For this cause, when I could no longer hold back, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain."
52,3,6,"But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and love, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:"
52,3,7,"Therefore, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:"
52,3,8,"For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord."
52,3,9,"For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy with which we joy for your sakes before our God;"
52,3,10,"Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
52,3,11,"Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you."
52,3,12,"And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, just as we do toward you:"
52,3,13,"To the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."
52,4,1,"Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more."
52,4,2,"For you know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus."
52,4,3,"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:"
52,4,4,"That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;"
52,4,5,"Not in the lust of sexual desire, just as the Gentiles which know not God:"
52,4,6,"That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified."
52,4,7,"For God has not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness."
52,4,8,"He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given unto us his Holy Spirit."
52,4,9,"But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write unto you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another."
52,4,10,"And indeed you do it toward all the brothers which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brothers, that you increase more and more;"
52,4,11,"And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;"
52,4,12,"That you may walk honestly toward them that are outside, and that you may have lack of nothing."
52,4,13,"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who are asleep, that you sorrow not, just as others which have no hope."
52,4,14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him."
52,4,15,"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent those who are asleep."
52,4,16,"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:"
52,4,17,"Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."
52,4,18,"Therefore comfort one another with these words."
52,5,1,"But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write unto you."
52,5,2,"For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night."
52,5,3,"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape."
52,5,4,"But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."
52,5,5,"You are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."
52,5,6,"Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober."
52,5,7,"For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night."
52,5,8,"But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation."
52,5,9,"For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,"
52,5,10,"Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him."
52,5,11,"Therefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, just as also you do."
52,5,12,"And we beseech you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;"
52,5,13,"And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves."
52,5,14,"Now we exhort you, brothers, warn them that are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all men."
52,5,15,"See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men."
52,5,16,"Rejoice evermore."
52,5,17,"Pray without ceasing."
52,5,18,"In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."
52,5,19,"Quench not the Spirit."
52,5,20,"Despise not prophesyings."
52,5,21,"Test all things; hold fast that which is good."
52,5,22,"Abstain from all appearance of evil."
52,5,23,"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
52,5,24,"Faithful is he that calls you, who also will do it."
52,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us."
52,5,26,"Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss."
52,5,27,"I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read unto all the holy brothers."
52,5,28,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen."
53,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
53,1,2,"Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,1,3,"We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers, as it is suitable, because that your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each other abounds;"
53,1,4,"So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure:"
53,1,5,"Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:"
53,1,6,"Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;"
53,1,7,"And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,"
53,1,8,"In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
53,1,9,"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"
53,1,10,"When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day."
53,1,11,"Therefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:"
53,1,12,"That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,1,"Now we beseech you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,"
53,2,2,"That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand."
53,2,3,"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, unless there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;"
53,2,4,"Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God."
53,2,5,"Remember you not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"
53,2,6,"And now you know what withholds that he might be revealed in his time."
53,2,7,"For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way."
53,2,8,"And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:"
53,2,9,"Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,"
53,2,10,"And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
53,2,11,"And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:"
53,2,12,"That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
53,2,13,"But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:"
53,2,14,"Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,15,"Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle."
53,2,16,"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which has loved us, and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,"
53,2,17,"Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work."
53,3,1,"Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, just as it is with you:"
53,3,2,"And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith."
53,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil."
53,3,4,"And we have confidence in the Lord regarding you, that you both do and will do the things which we command you."
53,3,5,"And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ."
53,3,6,"Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us."
53,3,7,"For yourselves know how you ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;"
53,3,8,"Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but wrought with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:"
53,3,9,"Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us."
53,3,10,"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
53,3,11,"For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies."
53,3,12,"Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread."
53,3,13,"But you, brothers, be not weary in well doing."
53,3,14,"And if any man obey not our word by this letter, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed."
53,3,15,"Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."
53,3,16,"Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all."
53,3,17,"The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write."
53,3,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen."
54,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;"
54,1,2,"Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord."
54,1,3,"As I asked you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,"
54,1,4,"Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do."
54,1,5,"Now the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:"
54,1,6,"From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;"
54,1,7,"Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm."
54,1,8,"But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;"
54,1,9,"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
54,1,10,"For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;"
54,1,11,"According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust."
54,1,12,"And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;"
54,1,13,"Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."
54,1,14,"And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
54,1,15,"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."
54,1,16,"Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to those who should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting."
54,1,17,"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."
54,1,18,"This charge I commit unto you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on you, that you by them might war a good warfare;"
54,1,19,"Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:"
54,1,20,"Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."
54,2,1,"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;"
54,2,2,"For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."
54,2,3,"For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;"
54,2,4,"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."
54,2,5,"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;"
54,2,6,"Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time."
54,2,7,"Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth."
54,2,8,"I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting."
54,2,9,"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;"
54,2,10,"But (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works."
54,2,11,"Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection."
54,2,12,"But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."
54,2,13,"For Adam was first formed, then Eve."
54,2,14,"And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression."
54,2,15,"Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with sobriety."
54,3,1,"This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work."
54,3,2,"A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;"
54,3,3,"Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;"
54,3,4,"One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;"
54,3,5,"(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)"
54,3,6,"Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil."
54,3,7,"Moreover he must have a good report of those who are outside; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil."
54,3,8,"Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;"
54,3,9,"Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience."
54,3,10,"And let these also first be tested; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless."
54,3,11,"Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things."
54,3,12,"Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
54,3,13,"For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus."
54,3,14,"These things write I unto you, hoping to come unto you shortly:"
54,3,15,"But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
54,3,16,"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."
54,4,1,"Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;"
54,4,2,"Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;"
54,4,3,"Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of those who believe and know the truth."
54,4,4,"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:"
54,4,5,"For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer."
54,4,6,"If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained."
54,4,7,"But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself rather unto godliness."
54,4,8,"For bodily exercise profits little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."
54,4,9,"This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation."
54,4,10,"For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe."
54,4,11,"These things command and teach."
54,4,12,"Let no man despise your youth; but be an example of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity."
54,4,13,"Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."
54,4,14,"Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery."
54,4,15,"Meditate upon these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your profiting may appear to all."
54,4,16,"Take heed unto yourself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you."
54,5,1,"Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as brothers;"
54,5,2,"The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity."
54,5,3,"Honor widows that are widows indeed."
54,5,4,"But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to repay their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God."
54,5,5,"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day."
54,5,6,"But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives."
54,5,7,"And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless."
54,5,8,"But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel."
54,5,9,"Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man."
54,5,10,"Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work."
54,5,11,"But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;"
54,5,12,"Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith."
54,5,13,"And beside this they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not."
54,5,14,"I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully."
54,5,15,"For some are already turned aside after Satan."
54,5,16,"If any man or woman that believes have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed."
54,5,17,"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine."
54,5,18,"For the scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward."
54,5,19,"Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses."
54,5,20,"Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear."
54,5,21,"I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality."
54,5,22,"Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure."
54,5,23,"Drink no longer only water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities."
54,5,24,"Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after."
54,5,25,"Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid."
54,6,1,"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed."
54,6,2,"And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort."
54,6,3,"If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;"
54,6,4,"He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,"
54,6,5,"Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw yourself."
54,6,6,"But godliness with contentment is great gain."
54,6,7,"For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out."
54,6,8,"And having food and clothing let us be therewith content."
54,6,9,"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition."
54,6,10,"For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
54,6,11,"But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness."
54,6,12,"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses."
54,6,13,"I give you charge in the sight of God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;"
54,6,14,"That you keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
54,6,15,"Which in his times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;"
54,6,16,"Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen."
54,6,17,"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;"
54,6,18,"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;"
54,6,19,"Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."
54,6,20,"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:"
54,6,21,"Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen."
55,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,"
55,1,2,"To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
55,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;"
55,1,4,"Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;"
55,1,5,"When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in you also."
55,1,6,"Therefore I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God, which is in you by the putting on of my hands."
55,1,7,"For God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."
55,1,8,"Be not you therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be you partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;"
55,1,9,"Who has saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,"
55,1,10,"But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:"
55,1,11,"Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."
55,1,12,"For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day."
55,1,13,"Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
55,1,14,"That good thing which was committed unto you keep by the Holy Ghost which dwells in us."
55,1,15,"This you know, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes."
55,1,16,"The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:"
55,1,17,"But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me."
55,1,18,"The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, you know very well."
55,2,1,"You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
55,2,2,"And the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit you to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."
55,2,3,"You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ."
55,2,4,"No man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier."
55,2,5,"And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, unless he strive lawfully."
55,2,6,"The husbandman that labors must be first partaker of the fruits."
55,2,7,"Consider what I say; and the Lord give you understanding in all things."
55,2,8,"Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:"
55,2,9,"Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound."
55,2,10,"Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
55,2,11,"It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:"
55,2,12,"If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:"
55,2,13,"If we believe not, yet he abides faithful: he cannot deny himself."
55,2,14,"Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers."
55,2,15,"Study to show yourself approved unto God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
55,2,16,"But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness."
55,2,17,"And their word will eat as does a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;"
55,2,18,"Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some."
55,2,19,"Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity."
55,2,20,"But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor."
55,2,21,"If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work."
55,2,22,"Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
55,2,23,"But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes."
55,2,24,"And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,"
55,2,25,"In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God perhaps will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;"
55,2,26,"And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will."
55,3,1,"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."
55,3,2,"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,"
55,3,3,"Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,"
55,3,4,"Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;"
55,3,5,"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power of it: from such turn away."
55,3,6,"For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with different lusts,"
55,3,7,"Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
55,3,8,"Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith."
55,3,9,"But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was."
55,3,10,"But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,"
55,3,11,"Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me."
55,3,12,"Yes, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
55,3,13,"But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived."
55,3,14,"But continue you in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing of whom you have learned them;"
55,3,15,"And that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."
55,3,16,"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:"
55,3,17,"That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works."
55,4,1,"I charge you therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;"
55,4,2,"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine."
55,4,3,"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;"
55,4,4,"And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables."
55,4,5,"But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry."
55,4,6,"For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand."
55,4,7,"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:"
55,4,8,"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing."
55,4,9,"Do your diligence to come shortly unto me:"
55,4,10,"For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia."
55,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry."
55,4,12,"And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus."
55,4,13,"The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when you come, bring with you, and the books, but especially the parchments."
55,4,14,"Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:"
55,4,15,"Of whom be you ware also; for he has greatly withstood our words."
55,4,16,"At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge."
55,4,17,"Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion."
55,4,18,"And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen."
55,4,19,"Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus."
55,4,20,"Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick."
55,4,21,"Do your diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers."
55,4,22,"The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen."
56,1,1,"Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;"
56,1,2,"In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;"
56,1,3,"But has in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;"
56,1,4,"To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour."
56,1,5,"For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:"
56,1,6,"If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly."
56,1,7,"For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;"
56,1,8,"But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;"
56,1,9,"Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the opponents."
56,1,10,"For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:"
56,1,11,"Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake."
56,1,12,"One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies."
56,1,13,"This witness is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;"
56,1,14,"Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth."
56,1,15,"Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled."
56,1,16,"They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate."
56,2,1,"But speak you the things which become sound doctrine:"
56,2,2,"That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience."
56,2,3,"The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;"
56,2,4,"That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,"
56,2,5,"To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed."
56,2,6,"Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded."
56,2,7,"In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,"
56,2,8,"Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you."
56,2,9,"Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not talking back;"
56,2,10,"Not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things."
56,2,11,"For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,"
56,2,12,"Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;"
56,2,13,"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;"
56,2,14,"Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."
56,2,15,"These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise you."
56,3,1,"Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,"
56,3,2,"To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness unto all men."
56,3,3,"For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving different lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another."
56,3,4,"But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,"
56,3,5,"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;"
56,3,6,"Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;"
56,3,7,"That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
56,3,8,"This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that you affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men."
56,3,9,"But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain."
56,3,10,"A man that is a heretic after the first and second admonition reject;"
56,3,11,"Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sins, being condemned of himself."
56,3,12,"When I shall send Areemas unto you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter."
56,3,13,"Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them."
56,3,14,"And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful."
56,3,15,"All that are with me salute you. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen."
57,1,1,"Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,"
57,1,2,"And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:"
57,1,3,"Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
57,1,4,"I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,"
57,1,5,"Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;"
57,1,6,"That the communication of your faith may become effective by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus."
57,1,7,"For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the insides of the saints are refreshed by you, brother."
57,1,8,"Therefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin you that which is fitting,"
57,1,9,"yet for love's sake I rather beseech you, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ."
57,1,10,"I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:"
57,1,11,"Which in time past was to you unprofitable, but now profitable to you and to me:"
57,1,12,"Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, my own insides:"
57,1,13,"Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:"
57,1,14,"But without your mind would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly."
57,1,15,"For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him forever;"
57,1,16,"Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?"
57,1,17,"If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself."
57,1,18,"If he has wronged you, or owes you anything, put that on mine account;"
57,1,19,"I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owe unto me even your own self besides."
57,1,20,"Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my insides in the Lord."
57,1,21,"Having confidence in your obedience I wrote unto you, knowing that you will also do more than I say."
57,1,22,"But meanwhile prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you."
57,1,23,"There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;"
57,1,24,"Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers."
57,1,25,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
58,1,1,"God, who at various times and in different manners spoke in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,"
58,1,2,"Has in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;"
58,1,3,"Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:"
58,1,4,"Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they."
58,1,5,"For unto which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?"
58,1,6,"And again, when he brings in the firstbegotten into the world, he says, And let all the angels of God worship him."
58,1,7,"And of the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire."
58,1,8,"But unto the Son he says, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom."
58,1,9,"You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows."
58,1,10,"And, You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands:"
58,1,11,"They shall perish; but you remain; and they all shall wax old as does a garment;"
58,1,12,"And as a vesture shall you fold them up, and they shall be changed: but you are the same, and your years shall not fail."
58,1,13,"But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?"
58,1,14,"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?"
58,2,1,"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip."
58,2,2,"For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;"
58,2,3,"How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;"
58,2,4,"God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with different miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?"
58,2,5,"For unto the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak."
58,2,6,"But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?"
58,2,7,"You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:"
58,2,8,"You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him."
58,2,9,"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man."
58,2,10,"For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
58,2,11,"For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,"
58,2,12,"Saying, I will declare your name unto my brothers, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto you."
58,2,13,"And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me."
58,2,14,"Since the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;"
58,2,15,"And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."
58,2,16,"For truthfully he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham."
58,2,17,"Therefore in all things it was proper for him to be made like unto his brothers, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people."
58,2,18,"For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help them that are tempted."
58,3,1,"Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;"
58,3,2,"Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house."
58,3,3,"For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has builded the house has more honor than the house."
58,3,4,"For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God."
58,3,5,"And Moses truthfully was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;"
58,3,6,"But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end."
58,3,7,"Therefore (as the Holy Ghost says, Today if you will hear his voice,"
58,3,8,"Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:"
58,3,9,"When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years."
58,3,10,"Therefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in their heart; and they have not known my ways."
58,3,11,"So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)"
58,3,12,"Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God."
58,3,13,"But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."
58,3,14,"For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end;"
58,3,15,"While it is said, Today if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation."
58,3,16,"For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses."
58,3,17,"But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?"
58,3,18,"And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?"
58,3,19,"So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief."
58,4,1,"Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it."
58,4,2,"For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it."
58,4,3,"For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world."
58,4,4,"For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works."
58,4,5,"And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest."
58,4,6,"Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter in it, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:"
58,4,7,"Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David, Today, after so long a time; as it is said, Today if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."
58,4,8,"For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day."
58,4,9,"There remains therefore a rest to the people of God."
58,4,10,"For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his."
58,4,11,"Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief."
58,4,12,"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
58,4,13,"Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
58,4,14,"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession."
58,4,15,"For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted just as we are, yet without sin."
58,4,16,"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."
58,5,1,"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:"
58,5,2,"Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity."
58,5,3,"And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins."
58,5,4,"And no man takes this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron."
58,5,5,"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest; but he that said unto him, You are my Son, today have I begotten you."
58,5,6,"As he says also in another place, You are a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec."
58,5,7,"Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;"
58,5,8,"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;"
58,5,9,"And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;"
58,5,10,"Called of God a high priest after the order of Melchisedec."
58,5,11,"Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing."
58,5,12,"For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and have become such as have need of milk, and not of strong food."
58,5,13,"For every one that uses milk is unskillfully in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe."
58,5,14,"But strong food belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
58,6,1,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,"
58,6,2,"Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."
58,6,3,"And this will we do, if God permit."
58,6,4,"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,"
58,6,5,"And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,"
58,6,6,"If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame."
58,6,7,"For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth herbs suitable for them by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God:"
58,6,8,"But that which bears thorns and briers is rejected, and is close unto cursing; whose end is to be burned."
58,6,9,"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak."
58,6,10,"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister."
58,6,11,"And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:"
58,6,12,"That you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
58,6,13,"For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,"
58,6,14,"Saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you."
58,6,15,"And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."
58,6,16,"For men truthfully swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife."
58,6,17,"Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:"
58,6,18,"That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:"
58,6,19,"Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil;"
58,6,20,"Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made a high priest forever after the order of Melchisedec."
58,7,1,"For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;"
58,7,2,"To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;"
58,7,3,"Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abides a priest continually."
58,7,4,"Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils."
58,7,5,"And truthfully they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:"
58,7,6,"But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises."
58,7,7,"And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better."
58,7,8,"And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives."
58,7,9,"And as I may so say, Levi also, who receives tithes, paid tithes in Abraham."
58,7,10,"For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him."
58,7,11,"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?"
58,7,12,"For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law."
58,7,13,"For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar."
58,7,14,"For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood."
58,7,15,"And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there arises another priest,"
58,7,16,"Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life."
58,7,17,"For he testifies, You are a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec."
58,7,18,"For there is truthfully a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness of it."
58,7,19,"For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw close unto God."
58,7,20,"And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:"
58,7,21,"(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec:)"
58,7,22,"By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament."
58,7,23,"And they truly were many priests, because they were not permitted to continue by reason of death:"
58,7,24,"But this man, because he continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood."
58,7,25,"Therefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them."
58,7,26,"For such a high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;"
58,7,27,"Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself."
58,7,28,"For the law makes men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the Son, who is consecrated for evermore."
58,8,1,"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;"
58,8,2,"A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."
58,8,3,"For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: therefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer."
58,8,4,"For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:"
58,8,5,"Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, says he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount."
58,8,6,"But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises."
58,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second."
58,8,8,"For finding fault with them, he says, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:"
58,8,9,"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, says the Lord."
58,8,10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:"
58,8,11,"And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest."
58,8,12,"For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."
58,8,13,"In that he says, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and grows old is ready to vanish away."
58,9,1,"Then truthfully the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary."
58,9,2,"For there was a tabernacle made; the first, in which was the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the sanctuary."
58,9,3,"And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;"
58,9,4,"Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, in which was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;"
58,9,5,"And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly."
58,9,6,"Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God."
58,9,7,"But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:"
58,9,8,"The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:"
58,9,9,"Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;"
58,9,10,"Which stood only in foods and drinks, and different washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation."
58,9,11,"But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;"
58,9,12,"Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us."
58,9,13,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:"
58,9,14,"How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
58,9,15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."
58,9,16,"For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator."
58,9,17,"For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator lives."
58,9,18,"Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood."
58,9,19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,"
58,9,20,"Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God has enjoined unto you."
58,9,21,"Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry."
58,9,22,"And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission."
58,9,23,"It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
58,9,24,"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:"
58,9,25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;"
58,9,26,"For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself."
58,9,27,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"
58,9,28,"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation."
58,10,1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect."
58,10,2,"For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins."
58,10,3,"But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year."
58,10,4,"For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins."
58,10,5,"Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:"
58,10,6,"In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you have had no pleasure."
58,10,7,"Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God."
58,10,8,"Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin you would not, neither had pleasure in it; which are offered by the law;"
58,10,9,"Then said he, Lo, I come to do your will, O God. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second."
58,10,10,"By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."
58,10,11,"And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:"
58,10,12,"But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;"
58,10,13,"From now on expecting till his enemies be made his footstool."
58,10,14,"For by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified."
58,10,15,"Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,"
58,10,16,"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;"
58,10,17,"And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more."
58,10,18,"Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin."
58,10,19,"Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,"
58,10,20,"By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;"
58,10,21,"And having a high priest over the house of God;"
58,10,22,"Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water."
58,10,23,"Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)"
58,10,24,"And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:"
58,10,25,"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching."
58,10,26,"For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,"
58,10,27,"But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."
58,10,28,"He that looked down upon Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:"
58,10,29,"Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite unto the Spirit of grace?"
58,10,30,"For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs unto me, I will recompense, says the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people."
58,10,31,"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
58,10,32,"But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;"
58,10,33,"Partly, while you were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, while you became companions of them that were so used."
58,10,34,"For you had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the plundering of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance."
58,10,35,"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward."
58,10,36,"For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise."
58,10,37,"For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry."
58,10,38,"Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."
58,10,39,"But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul."
58,11,1,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
58,11,2,"For by it the elders obtained a good report."
58,11,3,"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."
58,11,4,"By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks."
58,11,5,"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God."
58,11,6,"But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
58,11,7,"By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."
58,11,8,"By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing to where he went."
58,11,9,"By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:"
58,11,10,"For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God."
58,11,11,"Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised."
58,11,12,"Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable."
58,11,13,"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."
58,11,14,"For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country."
58,11,15,"And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from where they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned."
58,11,16,"But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly: therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city."
58,11,17,"By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,"
58,11,18,"Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall your seed be called:"
58,11,19,"Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure."
58,11,20,"By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come."
58,11,21,"By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff."
58,11,22,"By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones."
58,11,23,"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment."
58,11,24,"By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;"
58,11,25,"Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;"
58,11,26,"Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward."
58,11,27,"By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible."
58,11,28,"Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them."
58,11,29,"By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned."
58,11,30,"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days."
58,11,31,"By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace."
58,11,32,"And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:"
58,11,33,"Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions."
58,11,34,"Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, grown valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens."
58,11,35,"Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:"
58,11,36,"And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yes, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:"
58,11,37,"They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;"
58,11,38,"(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserted places, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth."
58,11,39,"And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:"
58,11,40,"God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."
58,12,1,"Therefore seeing we also are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,"
58,12,2,"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."
58,12,3,"For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds."
58,12,4,"You have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin."
58,12,5,"And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks unto you as unto children, My son, despise not you the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of him:"
58,12,6,"For whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives."
58,12,7,"If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chastens not?"
58,12,8,"But if you be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are you bastards, and not sons."
58,12,9,"Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them respect: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?"
58,12,10,"For they truthfully for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness."
58,12,11,"Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto those who are exercised thereby."
58,12,12,"Therefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;"
58,12,13,"And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed."
58,12,14,"Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:"
58,12,15,"Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;"
58,12,16,"Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright."
58,12,17,"For you know that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it anxiously with tears."
58,12,18,"For you are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,"
58,12,19,"And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:"
58,12,20,"(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:"
58,12,21,"And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)"
58,12,22,"But you are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,"
58,12,23,"To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,"
58,12,24,"And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel."
58,12,25,"See that you refuse not him that speaks. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaks from heaven:"
58,12,26,"Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven."
58,12,27,"And this word, yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain."
58,12,28,"Therefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with respect and godly fear:"
58,12,29,"For our God is a consuming fire."
58,13,1,"Let brotherly love continue."
58,13,2,"Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares."
58,13,3,"Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body."
58,13,4,"Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."
58,13,5,"Let your conduct be without covetousness; and be content with such things as you have: for he has said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you."
58,13,6,"So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me."
58,13,7,"Remember those who have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conduct."
58,13,8,"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever."
58,13,9,"Be not carried about with different and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with foods, which have not profited them that have been occupied in it."
58,13,10,"We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle."
58,13,11,"For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp."
58,13,12,"Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered outside the gate."
58,13,13,"Let us go forth therefore unto him outside the camp, bearing his reproach."
58,13,14,"For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come."
58,13,15,"By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name."
58,13,16,"But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."
58,13,17,"Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you."
58,13,18,"Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly."
58,13,19,"But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner."
58,13,20,"Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,"
58,13,21,"Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen."
58,13,22,"And I beseech you, brothers, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words."
58,13,23,"Know you that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you."
58,13,24,"Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you."
58,13,25,"Grace be with you all. Amen."
59,1,1,"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting."
59,1,2,"My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into different temptations;"
59,1,3,"Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience."
59,1,4,"But let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing."
59,1,5,"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraids not; and it shall be given him."
59,1,6,"But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed."
59,1,7,"For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord."
59,1,8,"A double minded man is unstable in all his ways."
59,1,9,"Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:"
59,1,10,"But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away."
59,1,11,"For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withers the grass, and the flower of it falls, and the grace of the fashion of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways."
59,1,12,"Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him."
59,1,13,"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:"
59,1,14,"But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed."
59,1,15,"Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death."
59,1,16,"Do not err, my beloved brothers."
59,1,17,"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."
59,1,18,"Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures."
59,1,19,"Therefore, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:"
59,1,20,"For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God."
59,1,21,"Therefore lay aside all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls."
59,1,22,"But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."
59,1,23,"For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:"
59,1,24,"For he beholds himself, and goes his way, and immediately forgets what manner of man he was."
59,1,25,"But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues in it, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."
59,1,26,"If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain."
59,1,27,"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."
59,2,1,"My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons."
59,2,2,"For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in good apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing;"
59,2,3,"And you have respect to him that wears the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit you here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand you there, or sit here under my footstool:"
59,2,4,"Are you not then partial in yourselves, and have become judges of evil thoughts?"
59,2,5,"Hearken, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?"
59,2,6,"But you have looked down upon the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?"
59,2,7,"Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which you are called?"
59,2,8,"If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture,"
59,2,9,"But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors."
59,2,10,"For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."
59,2,11,"For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you commit no adultery, yet if you kill, you have become a transgressor of the law."
59,2,12,"So speak you, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."
59,2,13,"For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment."
59,2,14,"What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?"
59,2,15,"If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,"
59,2,16,"And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be warmed and filled; notwithstanding you give them not those things which are necessary to the body; what does it profit?"
59,2,17,"Even so faith, if it has not works, is dead, being alone."
59,2,18,"Yes, a man may say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
59,2,19,"You believe that there is one God; you are doing well: the devils also believe, and tremble."
59,2,20,"But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"
59,2,21,"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?"
59,2,22,"See you how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?"
59,2,23,"And the scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God."
59,2,24,"You see then that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."
59,2,25,"Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?"
59,2,26,"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
59,3,1,"My brothers, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation."
59,3,2,"For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body."
59,3,3,"Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body."
59,3,4,"Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, wherever the governor desires."
59,3,5,"Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles!"
59,3,6,"And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell."
59,3,7,"For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed of mankind:"
59,3,8,"But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."
59,3,9,"Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God."
59,3,10,"Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not so to be."
59,3,11,"Does a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?"
59,3,12,"Can the fig tree, my brothers, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh."
59,3,13,"Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conduct his works with meekness of wisdom."
59,3,14,"But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth."
59,3,15,"This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish."
59,3,16,"For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work."
59,3,17,"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy."
59,3,18,"And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace."
59,4,1,"From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?"
59,4,2,"You lust, and have not: you kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: you fight and war, yet you have not, because you ask not."
59,4,3,"You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may consume it upon your lusts."
59,4,4,"You adulterers and adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God."
59,4,5,"Do you think that the scripture says in vain, The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy?"
59,4,6,"But he gives more grace. Therefore he says,"
59,4,7,"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
59,4,8,"Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double minded."
59,4,9,"Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness."
59,4,10,"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up."
59,4,11,"Speak not evil one of another, brothers. He that speaks evil of his brother, and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law, and judges the law: but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge."
59,4,12,"There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who are you that judges another?"
59,4,13,"Go to now, you that say, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:"
59,4,14,"Whereas you know not what shall be on the next day. For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away."
59,4,15,"For that you ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that."
59,4,16,"But now you rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil."
59,4,17,"Therefore to him that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin."
59,5,1,"Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you."
59,5,2,"Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth eaten."
59,5,3,"Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. You have heaped treasure together for the last days."
59,5,4,"Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cries: and the cries of those who have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth."
59,5,5,"You have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; you have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter."
59,5,6,"You have condemned and killed the just; and he does not resist you."
59,5,7,"Be patient therefore, brothers, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain."
59,5,8,"Be you also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draws close."
59,5,9,"Grudge not one against another, brothers, lest you be condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door."
59,5,10,"Take, my brothers, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience."
59,5,11,"Behold, we count them happy which endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy."
59,5,12,"But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation."
59,5,13,"Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms."
59,5,14,"Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:"
59,5,15,"And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."
59,5,16,"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The fervent prayer of a righteous man is effective and has great strength."
59,5,17,"Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months."
59,5,18,"And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit."
59,5,19,"Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;"
59,5,20,"Let him know, that he which converts the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins."
60,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
60,1,2,"Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied."
60,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"
60,1,4,"To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,"
60,1,5,"Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."
60,1,6,"Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations:"
60,1,7,"That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:"
60,1,8,"Whom having not seen, you love; in whom, though now you see him not, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:"
60,1,9,"Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."
60,1,10,"Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:"
60,1,11,"Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow."
60,1,12,"Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into."
60,1,13,"Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;"
60,1,14,"As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:"
60,1,15,"But as he which has called you is holy, so be holy in all manner of conduct;"
60,1,16,"Because it is written, Be you holy; for I am holy."
60,1,17,"And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:"
60,1,18,"Since as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conduct received by tradition from your fathers;"
60,1,19,"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:"
60,1,20,"Who truthfully was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,"
60,1,21,"Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God."
60,1,22,"Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:"
60,1,23,"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and abides forever."
60,1,24,"For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower of it falls away:"
60,1,25,"But the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you."
60,2,1,"Therefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,"
60,2,2,"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:"
60,2,3,"If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious."
60,2,4,"To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,"
60,2,5,"You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."
60,2,6,"Therefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded."
60,2,7,"Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,"
60,2,8,"And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offenses, even to those who stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed."
60,2,9,"But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;"
60,2,10,"Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy."
60,2,11,"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;"
60,2,12,"Having your conduct honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation."
60,2,13,"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;"
60,2,14,"Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well."
60,2,15,"For so is the will of God, that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:"
60,2,16,"As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God."
60,2,17,"Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king."
60,2,18,"Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the forward."
60,2,19,"For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully."
60,2,20,"For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God."
60,2,21,"For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:"
60,2,22,"Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:"
60,2,23,"Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:"
60,2,24,"Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed."
60,2,25,"For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls."
60,3,1,"Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conduct of the wives;"
60,3,2,"While they behold your chaste conduct coupled with fear."
60,3,3,"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;"
60,3,4,"But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price."
60,3,5,"For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:"
60,3,6,"Just as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid with any amazement."
60,3,7,"Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered."
60,3,8,"Finally, be you all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brothers, be pitiful, be courteous:"
60,3,9,"Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that you are thereunto called, that you should inherit a blessing."
60,3,10,"For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:"
60,3,11,"Let him shun evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it."
60,3,12,"For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil."
60,3,13,"And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?"
60,3,14,"But and if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;"
60,3,15,"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:"
60,3,16,"Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conduct in Christ."
60,3,17,"For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing."
60,3,18,"For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but given life by the Spirit:"
60,3,19,"By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;"
60,3,20,"Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, in which few, that is, eight souls were saved by water."
60,3,21,"The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:"
60,3,22,"Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him."
60,4,1,"Since Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;"
60,4,2,"That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God."
60,4,3,"For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:"
60,4,4,"Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:"
60,4,5,"Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead."
60,4,6,"For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."
60,4,7,"But the end of all things is at hand: be you therefore sober, and watch unto prayer."
60,4,8,"And above all things have fervent love among yourselves: for love shall cover the multitude of sins."
60,4,9,"Use hospitality one to another without grudging."
60,4,10,"As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."
60,4,11,"If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever. Amen."
60,4,12,"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:"
60,4,13,"But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy."
60,4,14,"If you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you; for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified."
60,4,15,"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters."
60,4,16,"yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf."
60,4,17,"For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?"
60,4,18,"And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"
60,4,19,"Therefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator."
60,5,1,"The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:"
60,5,2,"Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight of it, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;"
60,5,3,"Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock."
60,5,4,"And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away."
60,5,5,"Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. yes, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble."
60,5,6,"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:"
60,5,7,"Casting all your care upon him; for he cares for you."
60,5,8,"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:"
60,5,9,"Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brothers that are in the world."
60,5,10,"But the God of all grace, who has called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you."
60,5,11,"To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."
60,5,12,"By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand."
60,5,13,"The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son."
60,5,14,"Greet you one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen."
61,1,1,"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:"
61,1,2,"Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,"
61,1,3,"According as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:"
61,1,4,"Whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
61,1,5,"And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;"
61,1,6,"And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;"
61,1,7,"And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness love."
61,1,8,"For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
61,1,9,"But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins."
61,1,10,"Therefore instead, brothers, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:"
61,1,11,"For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
61,1,12,"Therefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and be established in the present truth."
61,1,13,"Yes, I think it suitable, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;"
61,1,14,"Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, just as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me."
61,1,15,"Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance."
61,1,16,"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
61,1,17,"For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
61,1,18,"And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount."
61,1,19,"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:"
61,1,20,"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation."
61,1,21,"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."
61,2,1,"But there were false prophets also among the people, just as there shall be false teachers among you, who secretly shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction."
61,2,2,"And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of."
61,2,3,"And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not."
61,2,4,"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;"
61,2,5,"And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;"
61,2,6,"And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an example unto those that after should live ungodly;"
61,2,7,"And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conduct of the wicked:"
61,2,8,"(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)"
61,2,9,"The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:"
61,2,10,"But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, self willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities."
61,2,11,"Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord."
61,2,12,"But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;"
61,2,13,"And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;"
61,2,14,"Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: a heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:"
61,2,15,"Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;"
61,2,16,"But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the anger of the prophet."
61,2,17,"These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved forever."
61,2,18,"For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error."
61,2,19,"While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage."
61,2,20,"For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in it, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning."
61,2,21,"For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them."
61,2,22,"But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."
61,3,1,"This second letter, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:"
61,3,2,"That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:"
61,3,3,"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,"
61,3,4,"And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."
61,3,5,"For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:"
61,3,6,"Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:"
61,3,7,"But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."
61,3,8,"But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
61,3,9,"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
61,3,10,"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are in it shall be burned up."
61,3,11,"Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conduct and godliness,"
61,3,12,"Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?"
61,3,13,"Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, in which dwells righteousness."
61,3,14,"Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless."
61,3,15,"And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him has written unto you;"
61,3,16,"As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction."
61,3,17,"You therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things before, beware lest you also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness."
61,3,18,"But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen."
62,1,1,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;"
62,1,2,"(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)"
62,1,3,"That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."
62,1,4,"And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."
62,1,5,"This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
62,1,6,"If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:"
62,1,7,"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin."
62,1,8,"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
62,1,9,"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
62,1,10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."
62,2,1,"My little children, these things write I unto you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:"
62,2,2,"And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world."
62,2,3,"And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments."
62,2,4,"He that says, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
62,2,5,"But whoever keeps his word, in him truthfully is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him."
62,2,6,"He that says he abides in him ought himself also so to walk, just as he walked."
62,2,7,"Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning."
62,2,8,"Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines."
62,2,9,"He that says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now."
62,2,10,"He that loves his brother abides in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him."
62,2,11,"But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not to where he goes, because darkness has blinded his eyes."
62,2,12,"I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake."
62,2,13,"I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because you have known the Father."
62,2,14,"I have written unto you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one."
62,2,15,"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
62,2,16,"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world."
62,2,17,"And the world passes away, and the lust of it: but he that does the will of God abides forever."
62,2,18,"Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time."
62,2,19,"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."
62,2,20,"But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things."
62,2,21,"I have not written unto you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth."
62,2,22,"Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son."
62,2,23,"Whosoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father: he that acknowledges the Son has the Father also."
62,2,24,"Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father."
62,2,25,"And this is the promise that he has promised us, even eternal life."
62,2,26,"These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you."
62,2,27,"But the anointing which you have received of him abides in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and just as it has taught you, you shall abide in him."
62,2,28,"And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming."
62,2,29,"If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him."
62,3,1,"Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not."
62,3,2,"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."
62,3,3,"And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure."
62,3,4,"Whosoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law."
62,3,5,"And you know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin."
62,3,6,"Whosoever abides in him sins not: whosoever sins has not seen him, neither known him."
62,3,7,"Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, just as he is righteous."
62,3,8,"He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil."
62,3,9,"Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God."
62,3,10,"In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother."
62,3,11,"For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another."
62,3,12,"Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."
62,3,13,"Marvel not, my brothers, if the world hate you."
62,3,14,"We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brothers. He that loves not his brother abides in death."
62,3,15,"Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."
62,3,16,"Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers."
62,3,17,"But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his insides of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?"
62,3,18,"My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth."
62,3,19,"And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him."
62,3,20,"For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things."
62,3,21,"Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God."
62,3,22,"And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight."
62,3,23,"And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment."
62,3,24,"And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given us."
62,4,1,"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world."
62,4,2,"Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:"
62,4,3,"And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world."
62,4,4,"You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."
62,4,5,"They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world hears them."
62,4,6,"We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error."
62,4,7,"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God."
62,4,8,"He that loves not knows not God; for God is love."
62,4,9,"In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him."
62,4,10,"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins."
62,4,11,"Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."
62,4,12,"No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us."
62,4,13,"Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit."
62,4,14,"And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world."
62,4,15,"Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him, and he in God."
62,4,16,"And we have known and believed the love that God has to us. God is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him."
62,4,17,"Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world."
62,4,18,"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear: because fear has torment. He that fears is not made perfect in love."
62,4,19,"We love him, because he first loved us."
62,4,20,"If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?"
62,4,21,"And this commandment have we from him, That he who loves God love his brother also."
62,5,1,"Whosoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him."
62,5,2,"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments."
62,5,3,"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."
62,5,4,"For whatsoever is born of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith."
62,5,5,"Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"
62,5,6,"This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth."
62,5,7,"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one."
62,5,8,"And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one."
62,5,9,"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son."
62,5,10,"He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself: he that believes not God has made him a liar; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son."
62,5,11,"And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son."
62,5,12,"He that has the Son has life; and he that has not the Son of God has not life."
62,5,13,"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God."
62,5,14,"And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:"
62,5,15,"And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him."
62,5,16,"If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it."
62,5,17,"All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death."
62,5,18,"We know that whosoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not."
62,5,19,"And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness."
62,5,20,"And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life."
62,5,21,"Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen."
63,1,1,"The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;"
63,1,2,"For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us forever."
63,1,3,"Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
63,1,4,"I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father."
63,1,5,"And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another."
63,1,6,"And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it."
63,1,7,"For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist."
63,1,8,"Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward."
63,1,9,"Whosoever transgresses, and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son."
63,1,10,"If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:"
63,1,11,"For he that bids him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds."
63,1,12,"Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full."
63,1,13,"The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen."
64,1,1,"The elder unto the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth."
64,1,2,"Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, just as your soul prospers."
64,1,3,"For I rejoiced greatly, when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, just as you walk in the truth."
64,1,4,"I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth."
64,1,5,"Beloved, you are doing faithfully whatsoever you are doing to the brothers, and to strangers;"
64,1,6,"Which have borne witness of your love before the church: whom if you bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, you shall do well:"
64,1,7,"Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles."
64,1,8,"We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellow helpers to the truth."
64,1,9,"I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, receives us not."
64,1,10,"Therefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church."
64,1,11,"Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God: but he that does evil has not seen God."
64,1,12,"Demetrius has good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yes, and we also bear record; and you know that our record is true."
64,1,13,"I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto you:"
64,1,14,"But I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. Our friends salute you. Greet the friends by name."
65,1,1,"Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:"
65,1,2,"Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied."
65,1,3,"Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was necessary for me to write unto you, and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints."
65,1,4,"For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ."
65,1,5,"I will therefore put you in remembrance, though you once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not."
65,1,6,"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."
65,1,7,"Just as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."
65,1,8,"Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities."
65,1,9,"Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you."
65,1,10,"But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves."
65,1,11,"Woe unto them! for they have gone on the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the opposing of Core."
65,1,12,"These are spots in your feasts of love, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withers, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;"
65,1,13,"Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever."
65,1,14,"And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his saints,"
65,1,15,"To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
65,1,16,"These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage."
65,1,17,"But, beloved, remember you the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
65,1,18,"That they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts."
65,1,19,"These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit."
65,1,20,"But you, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,"
65,1,21,"Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life."
65,1,22,"And of some have compassion, making a difference:"
65,1,23,"And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh."
65,1,24,"Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,"
65,1,25,"To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen."
66,1,1,"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:"
66,1,2,"Who bore record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw."
66,1,3,"Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it: for the time is at hand."
66,1,4,"John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;"
66,1,5,"And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,"
66,1,6,"And has made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."
66,1,7,"Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen."
66,1,8,""
66,1,9,"I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ."
66,1,10,"I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,"
66,1,11,"Saying,"
66,1,12,"And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;"
66,1,13,"And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girded about the chest with a golden girdle."
66,1,14,"His head and his hair was white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;"
66,1,15,"And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters."
66,1,16,"And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength."
66,1,17,"And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me,"

66,4,1,"After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up to here, and I will show you things which must be hereafter."
66,4,2,"And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne."
66,4,3,"And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald."
66,4,4,"And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white clothing; and they had on their heads crowns of gold."
66,4,5,"And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God."
66,4,6,"And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind."
66,4,7,"And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle."
66,4,8,"And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come."
66,4,9,"And when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who lives forever and ever,"
66,4,10,"The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,"
66,4,11,"You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created."
66,5,1,"And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals."
66,5,2,"And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals of it?"
66,5,3,"And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon."
66,5,4,"And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon."
66,5,5,"And one of the elders says unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals of it."
66,5,6,"And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth."
66,5,7,"And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne."
66,5,8,"And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints."
66,5,9,"And they sung a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals of it: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;"
66,5,10,"And have made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth."
66,5,11,"And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;"
66,5,12,"Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing."
66,5,13,"And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever."
66,5,14,"And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that lives forever and ever."
66,6,1,"And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see."
66,6,2,"And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer."
66,6,3,"And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see."
66,6,4,"And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword."
66,6,5,"And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand."
66,6,6,"And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a denarius, and three measures of barley for a denarius; and see you hurt not the oil and the wine."
66,6,7,"And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see."
66,6,8,"And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."
66,6,9,"And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:"
66,6,10,"And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"
66,6,11,"And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled."
66,6,12,"And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;"
66,6,13,"And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, just as a fig tree casts her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind."
66,6,14,"And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
66,6,15,"And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;"
66,6,16,"And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:"
66,6,17,"For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?"
66,7,1,"And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree."
66,7,2,"And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,"
66,7,3,"Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads."
66,7,4,"And I heard the number of those who were sealed: and there were sealed a hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel."
66,7,5,"Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,6,"Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,7,"Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,8,"Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,9,"After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;"
66,7,10,"And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb."
66,7,11,"And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,"
66,7,12,"Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God forever and ever. Amen."
66,7,13,"And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and from where came they?"
66,7,14,"And I said unto him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
66,7,15,"Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sits on the throne shall dwell among them."
66,7,16,"They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat."
66,7,17,"For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."
66,8,1,"And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour."
66,8,2,"And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets."
66,8,3,"And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne."
66,8,4,"And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand."
66,8,5,"And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake."
66,8,6,"And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound."
66,8,7,"The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up."
66,8,8,"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;"
66,8,9,"And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed."
66,8,10,"And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;"
66,8,11,"And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter."
66,8,12,"And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise."
66,8,13,"And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!"
66,9,1,"And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit."
66,9,2,"And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit."
66,9,3,"And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power."
66,9,4,"And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads."
66,9,5,"And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he strikes a man."
66,9,6,"And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them."
66,9,7,"And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men."
66,9,8,"And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions."
66,9,9,"And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle."
66,9,10,"And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months."
66,9,11,"And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue has his name Apollyon."
66,9,12,"One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter."
66,9,13,"And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,"
66,9,14,"Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates."
66,9,15,"And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men."
66,9,16,"And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them."
66,9,17,"And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone."
66,9,18,"By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths."
66,9,19,"For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt."
66,9,20,"And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:"
66,9,21,"Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts."
66,10,1,"And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:"
66,10,2,"And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,"
66,10,3,"And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices."
66,10,4,"And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not."
66,10,5,"And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,"
66,10,6,"And swore by him that lives for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that are in it, and the earth, and the things that are in it, and the sea, and the things which are in it, that there should be time no longer:"
66,10,7,"But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets."
66,10,8,"And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stands upon the sea and upon the earth."
66,10,9,"And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make your belly bitter, but it shall be in your mouth sweet as honey."
66,10,10,"And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter."
66,10,11,"And he said unto me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings."
66,11,1,"And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship in it."
66,11,2,"But the court which is outside the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months."
66,11,3,"And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth."
66,11,4,"These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth."
66,11,5,"And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed."
66,11,6,"These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will."
66,11,7,"And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them."
66,11,8,"And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified."
66,11,9,"And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not permit their dead bodies to be put in graves."
66,11,10,"And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelled on the earth."
66,11,11,"And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those who saw them."
66,11,12,"And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up to here. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them."
66,11,13,"And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were frightened, and gave glory to the God of heaven."
66,11,14,"The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe comes quickly."
66,11,15,"And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign forever and ever."
66,11,16,"And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,"
66,11,17,"Saying, We give you thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which are, and was, and are to come; because you have taken to you your great power, and have reigned."
66,11,18,"And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should give reward unto your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great; and should destroy those who destroy the earth."
66,11,19,"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail."
66,12,1,"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:"
66,12,2,"And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered."
66,12,3,"And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads."
66,12,4,"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born."
66,12,5,"And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne."
66,12,6,"And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days."
66,12,7,"And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,"
66,12,8,"And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven."
66,12,9,"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."
66,12,10,"And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brothers is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night."
66,12,11,"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death."
66,12,12,"Therefore rejoice, you heavens, and you that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has but a short time."
66,12,13,"And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child."
66,12,14,"And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent."
66,12,15,"And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood."
66,12,16,"And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth."
66,12,17,"And the dragon was very angry with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."
66,13,1,"And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy."
66,13,2,"And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority."
66,13,3,"And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast."
66,13,4,"And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?"
66,13,5,"And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months."
66,13,6,"And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven."
66,13,7,"And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations."
66,13,8,"And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
66,13,9,"If any man have an ear, let him hear."
66,13,10,"He that leads into captivity shall go into captivity: he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints."
66,13,11,"And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon."
66,13,12,"And he exercises all the power of the first beast before him, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed."
66,13,13,"And he does great wonders, so that he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,"
66,13,14,"And deceives them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live."
66,13,15,"And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."
66,13,16,"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:"
66,13,17,"And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
66,13,18,"Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six."
66,14,1,"And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads."
66,14,2,"And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:"
66,14,3,"And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth."
66,14,4,"These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb."
66,14,5,"And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God."
66,14,6,"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,"
66,14,7,"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."
66,14,8,"And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."
66,14,9,"And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,"
66,14,10,"The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:"
66,14,11,"And the smoke of their torment ascends up forever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receives the mark of his name."
66,14,12,"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
66,14,13,"And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them."
66,14,14,"And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle."
66,14,15,"And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in your sickle, and reap: for the time is come for you to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe."
66,14,16,"And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped."
66,14,17,"And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle."
66,14,18,"And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe."
66,14,19,"And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God."
66,14,20,"And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs."
66,15,1,"And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God."
66,15,2,"And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God."
66,15,3,"And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are your ways, you King of saints."
66,15,4,"Who shall not fear you, O Lord, and glorify your name? for you only are holy: for all nations shall come and worship before you; for your judgments are made manifest."
66,15,5,"And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:"
66,15,6,"And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles."
66,15,7,"And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever."
66,15,8,"And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled."
66,16,1,"And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels,"
66,16,2,"And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon those who worshipped his image."
66,16,3,"And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea."
66,16,4,"And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood."
66,16,5,"And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and was, and shall be, because you have judged thus."
66,16,6,"For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink; for they are worthy."
66,16,7,"And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments."
66,16,8,"And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire."
66,16,9,"And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which has power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory."
66,16,10,"And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,"
66,16,11,"And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds."
66,16,12,"And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water of it was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared."
66,16,13,"And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet."
66,16,14,"For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty."
66,16,15,""
66,16,16,"And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon."
66,16,17,"And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying,"
66,16,18,"And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great."
66,16,19,"And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath."
66,16,20,"And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found."
66,16,21,"And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague of it was exceedingly great."
66,17,1,"And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come to here; I will show unto you the judgment of the great whore that sits upon many waters:"
66,17,2,"With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication."
66,17,3,"So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns."
66,17,4,"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:"
66,17,5,"And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
66,17,6,"And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration."
66,17,7,"And the angel said unto me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns."
66,17,8,"The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is."
66,17,9,"And here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits."
66,17,10,"And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space."
66,17,11,"And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition."
66,17,12,"And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast."
66,17,13,"These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast."
66,17,14,"These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful."
66,17,15,"And he says unto me, The waters which you saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues."
66,17,16,"And the ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire."
66,17,17,"For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled."
66,17,18,"And the woman which you saw is that great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth."
66,18,1,"And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory."
66,18,2,"And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird."
66,18,3,"For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies."
66,18,4,"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues."
66,18,5,"For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities."
66,18,6,"Reward her just as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she has filled fill to her double."
66,18,7,"How much she has glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow."
66,18,8,"Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judges her."
66,18,9,"And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,"
66,18,10,"Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is your judgment come."
66,18,11,"And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buys their merchandise any more:"
66,18,12,"The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all citron wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,"
66,18,13,"And cinnamon, and odors, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men."
66,18,14,"And the fruits that your soul lusted after are departed from you, and all things which were dainty and good are departed from you, and you shall find them no more at all."
66,18,15,"The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,"
66,18,16,"And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!"
66,18,17,"For in one hour so great riches is come to nothing. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,"
66,18,18,"And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!"
66,18,19,"And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, in which were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate."
66,18,20,"Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets; for God has avenged you on her."
66,18,21,"And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all."
66,18,22,"And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in you; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in you; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in you;"
66,18,23,"And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in you; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in you: for your merchants were the great men of the earth; for by your sorceries were all nations deceived."
66,18,24,"And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth."
66,19,1,"And after these things I heard a great voice of many people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God:"
66,19,2,"For true and righteous are his judgments: for he has judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand."
66,19,3,"And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up forever and ever."

66,19,14,"And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean."
66,19,15,"And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God."
66,19,16,"And he has on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."
66,19,17,"And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;"
66,19,18,"That you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great."
66,19,19,"And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army."
66,19,20,"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."
66,19,21,"And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh."

66,20,4,"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years."
66,20,5,"But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection."

66,21,14,"And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
66,21,15,"And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates of it, and the wall of it."
66,21,16,"And the city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal."

66,21,19,"And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;"
66,21,20,"The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst."
66,21,21,"And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass."
