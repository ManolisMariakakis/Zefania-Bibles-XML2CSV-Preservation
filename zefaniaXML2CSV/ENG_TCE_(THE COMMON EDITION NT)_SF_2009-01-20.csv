40,1,1,"The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:"
40,1,2,"Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,"
40,1,3,"and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram,"
40,1,4,"Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon,"
40,1,5,"Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse,"
40,1,6,"and Jesse the father of King David."
40,1,7,"Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa,"
40,1,8,"Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah,"
40,1,9,"Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,"
40,1,10,"Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah,"
40,1,11,"and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon."
40,1,12,"And after the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,"
40,1,13,"Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor,"
40,1,14,"Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud,"
40,1,15,"Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob,"
40,1,16,"and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ."
40,1,17,"So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the exile to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations."
40,1,18,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: when his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit."
40,1,19,"Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to put her to public shame, was resolved to divorce her quietly."
40,1,20,"But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, »Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit."
40,1,21,"And she will give birth to a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.«"
40,1,22,"All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:"
40,1,23,""
40,1,24,"When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took his wife,"
40,1,25,"but did not know her until she had borne a son. And he called his name Jesus."
40,2,1,"Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,"
40,2,2,"saying, »Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East and have come to worship him.«"
40,2,3,"When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him."
40,2,4,"And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born."
40,2,5,"So they said to him, »In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:"
40,2,6,""
40,2,7,"Then Herod called the wise men secretly and determined from them what time the star had appeared."
40,2,8,"And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, »Go and search diligently for the young child, and when you have found him, bring back word to me, so that I too may come and worship him.«"
40,2,9,"When they had heard the king they went their way; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until it came to rest over the place where the child was."
40,2,10,"When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy."
40,2,11,"On coming into the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they fell down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, and of frankincense, and of myrrh."
40,2,12,"And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way."
40,2,13,"Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, »Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.«"
40,2,14,"When he rose, he took the young child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt,"
40,2,15,"and remained there until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, »Out of Egypt have I called my son.«"
40,2,16,"Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men."
40,2,17,"Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:"
40,2,18,""
40,2,19,"But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,"
40,2,20,"saying, »Rise, take the young child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young childs life are dead.«"
40,2,21,"And he rose and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel."
40,2,22,"But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,"
40,2,23,"and he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the Prophets might be fulfilled, »He shall be called a Nazarene.«"
40,3,1,"In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,"
40,3,2,"and saying, »Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.«"
40,3,3,"For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,"
40,3,4,"Now John wore a garment of camels hair, and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey."
40,3,5,"Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan went out to him,"
40,3,6,"and confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River."
40,3,7,"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, »You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
40,3,8,"Bear fruit worthy of repentance,"
40,3,9,"and do not think to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones."
40,3,10,"Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."
40,3,11,"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
40,3,12,"His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.«"
40,3,13,"Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him."
40,3,14,"But John tried to prevent him, saying, »I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?«"
40,3,15,"But Jesus answered him, »Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.« Then he consented."
40,3,16,"And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him."
40,3,17,"And behold, a voice from heaven, saying, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«"
40,4,1,"Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil."
40,4,2,"And he fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterward he was hungry."
40,4,3,"And the tempter came and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.«"
40,4,4,"But he answered, »It is written,"
40,4,5,"Then the devil took him to the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple,"
40,4,6,"and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written,"
40,4,7,"Jesus said to him, »Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.«"
40,4,8,"Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory."
40,4,9,"And he said to him, »All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.«"
40,4,10,"Then Jesus said to him, »Away, Satan! for it is written,"
40,4,11,"Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him."
40,4,12,"Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee."
40,4,13,"And leaving Nazareth, he went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,"
40,4,14,"that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:"
40,4,15,""
40,4,16,""
40,4,17,"From that time Jesus began to preach and say, »Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.«"
40,4,18,"As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen."
40,4,19,"And he said to them, »Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.«"
40,4,20,"Immediately they left their nets and followed him."
40,4,21,"Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them,"
40,4,22,"and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him."
40,4,23,"And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people."
40,4,24,"Then his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought to him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them."
40,4,25,"Great crowds followed himfrom Galilee, and from the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan."
40,5,1,"Seeing the crowds, he went up on a mountain, and when he sat down his disciples came to him."
40,5,2,"And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:"

40,5,4,""
40,5,5,""

40,5,7,""
40,5,8,""
40,5,9,""
40,5,10,""
40,5,11,"Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake."
40,5,12,"Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
40,5,13,"»You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its taste, how shall it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men."
40,5,14,"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden."
40,5,15,"Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house."
40,5,16,"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven."
40,5,17,"»Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them."
40,5,18,"For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will by any means pass from the Law until all is accomplished."
40,5,19,"Whoever then breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
40,5,20,"For I tell you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven."
40,5,21,"»You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be liable to judgment."
40,5,22,"But I say to you that anyone who is angry with his brother shall be subject to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be answerable to the council. But whoever says, You fool! shall be in danger of the fire of hell."
40,5,23,"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,"
40,5,24,"leave your gift there before the altar, and go. First be reconciled to your brother; and then come and offer your gift."
40,5,25,"Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him to court, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison."
40,5,26,"Truly, I say to you, you will never get out till you have paid the last penny."
40,5,27,"»You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery."
40,5,28,"But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."
40,5,29,"If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
40,5,30,"And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell."
40,5,31,"»It has also been said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce."
40,5,32,"But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, causes her to become an adulteress; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery."
40,5,33,"»Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord."
40,5,34,"But I say to you, do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is Gods throne;"
40,5,35,"or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King."
40,5,36,"And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black."
40,5,37,"Simply let your Yes be Yes, and your No, No; anything more than this comes from evil."
40,5,38,"»You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."
40,5,39,"But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. But if someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also."
40,5,40,"And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well."
40,5,41,"And if someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles."
40,5,42,"Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away."
40,5,43,"»You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
40,5,44,"But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,"
40,5,45,"that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
40,5,46,"For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?"
40,5,47,"And if you greet only your brethren, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?"
40,5,48,"You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
40,6,1,"»Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven."
40,6,2,"»Thus, when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward."
40,6,3,"But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,"
40,6,4,"so that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you."
40,6,5,"»And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward."
40,6,6,"But when you pray, go into your room, shut the door and pray to your Father, who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you."
40,6,7,"And when you pray, do not use empty repetitions as the Gentiles do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words."
40,6,8,"Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him."
40,6,9,"Pray, then, in this way:"
40,6,10,""
40,6,11,""
40,6,12,""
40,6,13,""
40,6,14,"For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you."
40,6,15,"But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
40,6,16,"»And when you fast, do not look gloomy, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward."
40,6,17,"But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,"
40,6,18,"so that you do not appear to be fasting to men, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you."
40,6,19,"»Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,"
40,6,20,"but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal."
40,6,21,"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
40,6,22,"The lamp of the body is the eye. So if your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light."
40,6,23,"But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!"
40,6,24,"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."
40,6,25,"»Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
40,6,26,"Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?"
40,6,27,"Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his span of life?"
40,6,28,"And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin,"
40,6,29,"yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
40,6,30,"Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
40,6,31,"Therefore do not worry, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear?"
40,6,32,"For the Gentiles seek after all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all."
40,6,33,"But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be given to you as well."
40,6,34,"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."
40,7,1,"»Judge not, that you be not judged."
40,7,2,"For with the same judgment you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."
40,7,3,"And why do you look at the speck in your brothers eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?"
40,7,4,"Or how can you say to your brother, Let me take the speck out of your eye, when there is a plank in your own eye?"
40,7,5,"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye."
40,7,6,"Do not give what is holy to the dogs; do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces."
40,7,7,"»Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."
40,7,8,"For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened."
40,7,9,"Or what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?"
40,7,10,"Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?"
40,7,11,"If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!"
40,7,12,"So whatever you wish that men would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets."
40,7,13,"»Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide, and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter by it."
40,7,14,"For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and few are those who find it."
40,7,15,"»Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheeps clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves."
40,7,16,"You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?"
40,7,17,"Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit."
40,7,18,"A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit."
40,7,19,"Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."
40,7,20,"Thus you will know them by their fruits."
40,7,21,"»Not every one who says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."
40,7,22,"On that day many will say to me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
40,7,23,"And then will I declare to them, I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers!"
40,7,24,"»Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
40,7,25,"And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock."
40,7,26,"And every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand;"
40,7,27,"and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell. And great was its fall.«"
40,7,28,"And when Jesus had finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,"
40,7,29,"for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes."
40,8,1,"When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him."
40,8,2,"And behold, a leper came and knelt before him, saying, »Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.«"
40,8,3,"Then Jesus put out his hand and touched him, saying, »I am willing; be clean.« Immediately his leprosy was cleansed."
40,8,4,"And Jesus said to him, »See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.«"
40,8,5,"When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help,"
40,8,6,"and saying, »Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, in terrible distress.«"
40,8,7,"And Jesus said to him, »I will come and heal him.«"
40,8,8,"But the centurion answered him, »Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But only say the word, and my servant will be healed."
40,8,9,"For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.«"
40,8,10,"When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, »Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith."
40,8,11,"I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven."
40,8,12,"But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.«"
40,8,13,"Then to the centurion Jesus said, »Go; be it done for you as you have believed.« And his servant was healed at that very hour."
40,8,14,"When Jesus come into Peters house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever."
40,8,15,"He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and served him."
40,8,16,"When evening had come, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed. And he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick."
40,8,17,"This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:"
40,8,18,"Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side."
40,8,19,"Then a certain scribe came and said to him, »Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.«"
40,8,20,"And Jesus said to him, »Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.«"
40,8,21,"Another of the disciples said to him, »Lord, let me first go and bury my father.«"
40,8,22,"But Jesus said to him, »Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.«"
40,8,23,"And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him."
40,8,24,"And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But he was asleep."
40,8,25,"The disciples went and woke him, saying, »Lord, save us! We are perishing!«"
40,8,26,"And he said to them, »Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?« Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm."
40,8,27,"And the men marveled, saying, »What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?«"
40,8,28,"When he had come to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way."
40,8,29,"And behold, they cried out, »What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?«"
40,8,30,"Now a herd of many swine was feeding at some distance from them."
40,8,31,"And the demons begged him, »If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.«"
40,8,32,"And he said to them, »Go.« So they came out and went into the swine; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the water."
40,8,33,"Then those who kept them fled, and they went away into the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men."
40,8,34,"And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region."
40,9,1,"And getting into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own city."
40,9,2,"And behold, they brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic, »Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.«"
40,9,3,"And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, »This man is blaspheming!«"
40,9,4,"But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, »Why do you think evil in your hearts?"
40,9,5,"For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and walk?"
40,9,6,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins«he then said to the paralytic»Rise, take up your bed and go home.«"
40,9,7,"And he rose and went home."
40,9,8,"When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men."
40,9,9,"As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, »Follow me.« And he rose and followed him."
40,9,10,"And as Jesus sat at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples."
40,9,11,"And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, »Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?«"
40,9,12,"But when Jesus heard it, he said, »Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
40,9,13,"But go and learn what this means: I desire mercy, and not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.«"
40,9,14,"Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, »Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?«"
40,9,15,"And Jesus said to them, »Can the guests of the bridegroom mourn as long as he is with them? The days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast."
40,9,16,"No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse."
40,9,17,"Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; if they do, the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and so both are preserved.«"
40,9,18,"While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came and knelt before him, saying, »My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her and she will live.«"
40,9,19,"So Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples."
40,9,20,"And behold, a woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment."
40,9,21,"For she said to herself, »If I only touch his garment, I shall be made well.«"
40,9,22,"Jesus turned, and when he saw her he said, »Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.« And the woman was made well from that moment."
40,9,23,"When Jesus came to the rulers house, and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd,"
40,9,24,"he said, »Depart; for the girl is not dead but sleeping.« And they laughed at him."
40,9,25,"But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose."
40,9,26,"And the report of this went through all that region."
40,9,27,"And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, »Have mercy on us, Son of David.«"
40,9,28,"When he had entered the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them, »Do you believe that I am able to do this?« They said to him, »Yes, Lord.«"
40,9,29,"Then he touched their eyes, saying, »According to your faith be it done to you.«"
40,9,30,"And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, »See that no one knows it.«"
40,9,31,"But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region."
40,9,32,"As they were going out, behold, a mute and demon-possessed man was brought to him."
40,9,33,"And when the demon had been cast out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds marveled, saying, »Never was anything like this seen in Israel.«"
40,9,34,"But the Pharisees said, »He casts out demons by the prince of demons.«"
40,9,35,"And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness."
40,9,36,"When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."
40,9,37,"Then he said to his disciples, »The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
40,9,38,"Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.«"
40,10,1,"And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness."
40,10,2,"The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;"
40,10,3,"Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;"
40,10,4,"Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him."
40,10,5,"These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them: »Do not go among the Gentiles, or enter any town of the Samaritans."
40,10,6,"But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
40,10,7,"And preach as you go, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand."
40,10,8,"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give."
40,10,9,"Take no gold, nor silver, nor copper in your belts,"
40,10,10,"nor bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food."
40,10,11,"Now whatever village or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you go out."
40,10,12,"As you enter the house, give it your greeting."
40,10,13,"And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you."
40,10,14,"And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town."
40,10,15,"Truly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town."
40,10,16,"»Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves."
40,10,17,"But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their synagogues."
40,10,18,"You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles."
40,10,19,"But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour;"
40,10,20,"for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you."
40,10,21,"Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death."
40,10,22,"And you will be hated by all for my names sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved."
40,10,23,"When they persecute you in one city, flee to another. For truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
40,10,24,"»A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master."
40,10,25,"It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household!"
40,10,26,"»So do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known."
40,10,27,"What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim on the housetops."
40,10,28,"And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
40,10,29,"Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Fathers will."
40,10,30,"But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered."
40,10,31,"Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows."
40,10,32,"»Therefore whoever acknowledges me before men, him I will also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven."
40,10,33,"But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven."
40,10,34,"»Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword."
40,10,35,"For I have come"
40,10,36,""
40,10,37,"He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;"
40,10,38,"and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
40,10,39,"He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it."
40,10,40,"»He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me."
40,10,41,"He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophets reward, and he who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward."
40,10,42,"And whoever gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.«"
40,11,1,"And when Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities."
40,11,2,"Now when John heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent word by his disciples"
40,11,3,"and said to him, »Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?«"
40,11,4,"And Jesus answered them, »Go and tell John what you hear and see:"
40,11,5,"the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them."
40,11,6,"And blessed is he who is not offended because of me.«"
40,11,7,"As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: »What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
40,11,8,"But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses."
40,11,9,"Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet."
40,11,10,"For this is he of whom it is written:"
40,11,11,"Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
40,11,12,"From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and men of violence take it by force."
40,11,13,"For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John."
40,11,14,"And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who is to come."
40,11,15,"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
40,11,16,"»But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions,"
40,11,17,""
40,11,18,"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon."
40,11,19,"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her deeds.«"
40,11,20,"Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent."
40,11,21,"»Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
40,11,22,"But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you."
40,11,23,"And you, Capernaum,"
40,11,24,"But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.«"
40,11,25,"At that time Jesus declared, »I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes."
40,11,26,"Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure."
40,11,27,"»All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
40,11,28,"Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
40,11,29,"Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
40,11,30,"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.«"
40,12,1,"At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat."
40,12,2,"But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, »Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.«"
40,12,3,"He said to them, »Have you not read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him:"
40,12,4,"how he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?"
40,12,5,"Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are innocent?"
40,12,6,"I tell you that one greater than the temple is here."
40,12,7,"And if you had known what this means, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless."
40,12,8,"For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.«"
40,12,9,"And he went on from there, and went into their synagogue."
40,12,10,"And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. And they asked him, »Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?« so that they might accuse him."
40,12,11,"He said to them, »What man of you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?"
40,12,12,"Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.«"
40,12,13,"Then he said to the man, »Stretch out your hand.« And he stretched it out, and it was restored as whole as the other."
40,12,14,"But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, how they might destroy him."
40,12,15,"Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all,"
40,12,16,"and ordered them not to make him known."
40,12,17,"This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:"
40,12,18,""
40,12,19,""
40,12,20,""
40,12,21,""
40,12,22,"Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and he healed him, so that the mute man both spoke and saw."
40,12,23,"And all the people were amazed and said, »Could this be the Son of David?«"
40,12,24,"But when the Pharisees heard this they said, »It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.«"
40,12,25,"Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, »Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
40,12,26,"If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?"
40,12,27,"And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges."
40,12,28,"But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."
40,12,29,"Or how can one enter a strong mans house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house."
40,12,30,"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters."
40,12,31,"Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven."
40,12,32,"Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
40,12,33,"»Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit."
40,12,34,"You brood of vipers! how can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
40,12,35,"The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things."
40,12,36,"But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken."
40,12,37,"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.«"
40,12,38,"Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, »Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.«"
40,12,39,"But he answered them, »An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
40,12,40,"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
40,12,41,"The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here."
40,12,42,"The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here."
40,12,43,"»When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none."
40,12,44,"Then he says, I will return to my house from which I came. And when he comes he finds it empty, swept, and put in order."
40,12,45,"Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation.«"
40,12,46,"While he was still talking to the people, behold, his mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him."
40,12,47,"Someone told him, »Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.«"
40,12,48,"But he replied to the man who told him, »Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?«"
40,12,49,"And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, »Here are my mother and my brothers!"
40,12,50,"For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.«"
40,13,1,"That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea."
40,13,2,"And great crowds gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat there; and the whole crowd stood on the shore."
40,13,3,"Then he told them many things in parables, saying: »A sower went out to sow his seed."
40,13,4,"And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them."
40,13,5,"Some fell on rocky places, where they did not have much soil, and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of soil."
40,13,6,"But when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away."
40,13,7,"Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them."
40,13,8,"But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty."
40,13,9,"He who has ears, let him hear.«"
40,13,10,"The disciples came and said to him, »Why do you speak to them in parables?«"
40,13,11,"And he answered them, »To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
40,13,12,"For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."
40,13,13,"This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand."
40,13,14,"In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says:"
40,13,15,""
40,13,16,"But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear."
40,13,17,"For truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it."
40,13,18,"»Hear then the parable of the sower:"
40,13,19,"when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path."
40,13,20,"But he who received the seed on rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;"
40,13,21,"yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. And when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away."
40,13,22,"Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word, but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful."
40,13,23,"But the one who received seed on the good soil is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.«"
40,13,24,"Another parable he put forth to them, saying: »The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;"
40,13,25,"but while men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away."
40,13,26,"So when the plants sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also."
40,13,27,"And the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then has it weeds?"
40,13,28,"He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Then do you want us to go and gather them up?"
40,13,29,"But he said, No, lest while you gather up the weeds you also root up the wheat with them."
40,13,30,"Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers. Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.«"
40,13,31,"Another parable he put forth to them, saying: »The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;"
40,13,32,"it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.«"
40,13,33,"He told them another parable: »The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it was all leavened.«"
40,13,34,"All these things Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; and without a parable he did not speak to them."
40,13,35,"So was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet:"
40,13,36,"Then he left the crowd and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, »Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.«"
40,13,37,"He answered, »He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;"
40,13,38,"the field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,"
40,13,39,"and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels."
40,13,40,"Therefore as the weeds are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age."
40,13,41,"The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil,"
40,13,42,"and will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40,13,43,"Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear."
40,13,44,"»Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and then in his joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
40,13,45,"»Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,"
40,13,46,"who, when he had found one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it."
40,13,47,"»Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind;"
40,13,48,"which, when it was full, they drew it up on the shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away."
40,13,49,"So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous"
40,13,50,"and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.«"
40,13,51,"Jesus asked, »Have you understood all these things?« »Yes,« they said to him."
40,13,52,"And he said to them, »Therefore every scribe who has been instructed for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.«"
40,13,53,"When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there."
40,13,54,"And coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, »Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?"
40,13,55,"Is this not the carpenters son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?"
40,13,56,"And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?«"
40,13,57,"And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.«"
40,13,58,"And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief."
40,14,1,"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus,"
40,14,2,"and he said to his servants, »This is John the Baptist, he has risen from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him.«"
40,14,3,"For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philips wife,"
40,14,4,"because John had said to him, »It is not lawful for you to have her.«"
40,14,5,"And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet."
40,14,6,"But when Herods birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,"
40,14,7,"so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask."
40,14,8,"Prompted by her mother, she said, »Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.«"
40,14,9,"And the king was sorry; but, because of his oaths and his guests, he commanded it to be given to her;"
40,14,10,"so he sent and had John beheaded in prison."
40,14,11,"And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother."
40,14,12,"Then his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus."
40,14,13,"Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a lonely place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns."
40,14,14,"When Jesus went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick."
40,14,15,"When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, »This is a remote place, and its already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.«"
40,14,16,"Jesus said, »They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.«"
40,14,17,"They said to him, »We have only five loaves here and two fish.«"
40,14,18,"He said, »Bring them here to me,«"
40,14,19,"Then he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the multitudes."
40,14,20,"And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over."
40,14,21,"Now those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children."
40,14,22,"Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the multitudes."
40,14,23,"And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,"
40,14,24,"but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them."
40,14,25,"And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea."
40,14,26,"But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, »It is a ghost!« And they cried out for fear."
40,14,27,"But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, »Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.«"
40,14,28,"And Peter answered him, »Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.«"
40,14,29,"So he said, »Come«. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus."
40,14,30,"But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, »Lord, save me!«"
40,14,31,"Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, and said to him, »O you of little faith, why did you doubt?«"
40,14,32,"And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased."
40,14,33,"Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, »Truly you are the Son of God.«"
40,14,34,"When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret."
40,14,35,"And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent to all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick,"
40,14,36,"and begged him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well."
40,15,1,"Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus and said,"
40,15,2,"»Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.«"
40,15,3,"He answered them, »And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?"
40,15,4,"For God commanded, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death."
40,15,5,"But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift to God"
40,15,6,"he is not to honor his father with it. Thus you have made the word of God of no effect for the sake of your tradition."
40,15,7,"You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, when he said:"
40,15,8,""
40,15,9,""
40,15,10,"And he called the people to him and said to them, »Hear and understand:"
40,15,11,"not what goes into the mouth defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.«"
40,15,12,"Then the disciples came and said to him, »Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?«"
40,15,13,"He answered, »Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up."
40,15,14,"Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.«"
40,15,15,"But Peter said to him, »Explain the parable to us.«"
40,15,16,"So Jesus said, »Are you also still without understanding?"
40,15,17,"Do you not yet see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?"
40,15,18,"But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man."
40,15,19,"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornications, theft, false witness, slander."
40,15,20,"These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.«"
40,15,21,"And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon."
40,15,22,"And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried to him, »Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.«"
40,15,23,"But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, »Send her away, for she is crying out after us.«"
40,15,24,"He answered, »I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.«"
40,15,25,"But she came and knelt before him, saying, »Lord, help me!«"
40,15,26,"And he answered, »It is not good to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs.«"
40,15,27,"»Yes, Lord,« she said, »yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table.«"
40,15,28,"Then Jesus answered her, »O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.« And her daughter was healed from that very hour."
40,15,29,"And Jesus went on from there and passed along the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain, and sat down there."
40,15,30,"Then great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the mute, and many others; and they laid them down at his feet, and he healed them."
40,15,31,"So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel."
40,15,32,"Now Jesus called his disciples to him and said, »I have compassion on the multitude, because they have been with me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.«"
40,15,33,"Then his disciples said to him, »Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a great crowd?«"
40,15,34,"And Jesus said to them, »How many loaves do you have?« They said, »Seven, and a few small fish.«"
40,15,35,"He told the crowd to sit down on the ground."
40,15,36,"Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds."
40,15,37,"And they all ate and were satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over."
40,15,38,"Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children."
40,15,39,"And he sent away the crowds, got into the boat, and went to the region of Magadan."
40,16,1,"Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven."
40,16,2,"He answered them, »When it is evening, you say, It will be fair weather; for the sky is red."
40,16,3,"And in the morning, It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening. You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times."
40,16,4,"A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah.« So he left them and departed."
40,16,5,"When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to take bread."
40,16,6,"Then Jesus said to them, »Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.«"
40,16,7,"And they discussed among themselves, saying, »It is because we have taken no bread.«"
40,16,8,"But Jesus, aware of this, said, »O men of little faith, why do you discuss among yourselves the fact that you have no bread?"
40,16,9,"Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?"
40,16,10,"Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?"
40,16,11,"How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.«"
40,16,12,"Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40,16,13,"When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, »Who do men say that the Son of Man is?«"
40,16,14,"And they said, »Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.«"
40,16,15,"He said to them, »But who do you say that I am?«"
40,16,16,"Simon Peter answered, »You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.«"
40,16,17,"And Jesus answered him, »Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
40,16,18,"And I tell you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it."
40,16,19,"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.«"
40,16,20,"Then he strictly charged his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ."
40,16,21,"From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day."
40,16,22,"Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying, »Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!«"
40,16,23,"But he turned and said to Peter, »Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.«"
40,16,24,"Then Jesus said to his disciples, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
40,16,25,"For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
40,16,26,"What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?"
40,16,27,"For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will reward each man according to what he has done."
40,16,28,"Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.«"
40,17,1,"After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves."
40,17,2,"And he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light."
40,17,3,"And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him."
40,17,4,"And Peter said to Jesus, »Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make here three tabernaclesone for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«"
40,17,5,"While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and a voice from the cloud said, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!«"
40,17,6,"When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with awe."
40,17,7,"But Jesus came and touched them and said, »Rise. Dont be afraid.«"
40,17,8,"And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only."
40,17,9,"And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, »Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.«"
40,17,10,"And the disciples asked him, »Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?«"
40,17,11,"Jesus replied, »Elijah is coming first and will restore all things."
40,17,12,"But I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.«"
40,17,13,"Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist."
40,17,14,"And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and kneeling before him said,"
40,17,15,"»Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire, and often into the water."
40,17,16,"And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.«"
40,17,17,"Then Jesus answered, »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me.«"
40,17,18,"And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured from that moment."
40,17,19,"Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, »Why could we not cast it out?«"
40,17,20,"So he said to them, »Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.«"
40,17,21,""
40,17,22,"Now while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, »The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men,"
40,17,23,"and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day.« And they were greatly distressed."
40,17,24,"When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the half-shekel tax went up to Peter and said, »Does not your teacher pay the temple tax?«"
40,17,25,"He said, »Yes.« And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, »What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from others?«"
40,17,26,"And when Peter said, »From others,« Jesus said to him, »Then the sons are free."
40,17,27,"Nevertheless, so that we may not offend them, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you open its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for me and you.«"
40,18,1,"At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, »Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?«"
40,18,2,"He called to him a little child, and put him in the midst of them,"
40,18,3,"and he said, »Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
40,18,4,"Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
40,18,5,"Whoever receives one little child like this in my name receives me."
40,18,6,"»But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea."
40,18,7,"Woe to the world because of temptations to sin! For temptations must come, but woe to the man by whom the temptation comes!"
40,18,8,"And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire."
40,18,9,"And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell."
40,18,10,"»See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
40,18,11,""
40,18,12,"What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains in search of the one that went astray?"
40,18,13,"And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray."
40,18,14,"So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish."
40,18,15,"»If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."
40,18,16,"But if he will not listen, take one or two others along with you, so that every matter may be established by the word of two or three witnesses."
40,18,17,"If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."
40,18,18,"»Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
40,18,19,"Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven."
40,18,20,"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.«"
40,18,21,"Then Peter came to him and said, »Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?«"
40,18,22,"Jesus said to him, »I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven."
40,18,23,"Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants."
40,18,24,"When he began the settlement, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents."
40,18,25,"And as he was not able to pay, his master ordered that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made."
40,18,26,"So the servant fell on his knees before him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything."
40,18,27,"The master of that servant took pity on him, released him, and forgave him the debt."
40,18,28,"But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe."
40,18,29,"So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, Have patience with me, and I will pay you back."
40,18,30,"But he refused, and went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt."
40,18,31,"When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and went and told their master all that had happened."
40,18,32,"Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me."
40,18,33,"Should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?"
40,18,34,"And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed."
40,18,35,"So also my heavenly Father will do to each of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.«"
40,19,1,"Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan."
40,19,2,"And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there."
40,19,3,"Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, »Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?«"
40,19,4,"And he answered them, »Have you not read that he who made them at the beginning made them male and female,"
40,19,5,"and said, For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh?"
40,19,6,"So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.«"
40,19,7,"They said to him, »Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?«"
40,19,8,"He said to them, »Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so."
40,19,9,"And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.«"
40,19,10,"The disciples said to him, »If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.«"
40,19,11,"But he said to them, »Not all men can accept this saying, but only those to whom it has been given."
40,19,12,"For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mothers womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept it, let him accept it.«"
40,19,13,"Then little children were brought to him that he might put his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them."
40,19,14,"But Jesus said, »Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.«"
40,19,15,"And he laid his hands on them and went from there."
40,19,16,"Now behold, one came up and said to him, »Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?«"
40,19,17,"And he said to him, »Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.«"
40,19,18,"He said to him, »Which ones?« And Jesus said, »You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,"
40,19,19,"honor your father and mother, and, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.«"
40,19,20,"The young man said to him, »All these I have kept. What do I still lack?«"
40,19,21,"Jesus said to him, »If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.«"
40,19,22,"But when the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions."
40,19,23,"Then Jesus said to his disciples, »Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."
40,19,24,"Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.«"
40,19,25,"When the disciples heard this they were greatly astonished, saying, »Who then can be saved?«"
40,19,26,"But Jesus looked at them and said to them, »With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.«"
40,19,27,"Then Peter answered him, »Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What then shall we have?«"
40,19,28,"Jesus said to them, »Truly I say to you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
40,19,29,"And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my names sake, will receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life."
40,19,30,"But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
40,20,1,"»For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard."
40,20,2,"Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard."
40,20,3,"And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,"
40,20,4,"and to them he said, You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you. So they went."
40,20,5,"Again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, and did the same thing."
40,20,6,"And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why have you been standing here idle all day?"
40,20,7,"They said to him, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive."
40,20,8,"And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first."
40,20,9,"And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius."
40,20,10,"So when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius."
40,20,11,"And when they had received it, they complained against the landowner,"
40,20,12,"saying, These last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day."
40,20,13,"But he answered one of them, Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?"
40,20,14,"Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as I gave to you."
40,20,15,"Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?"
40,20,16,"So the last will be first, and the first will be last.«"
40,20,17,"Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,"
40,20,18,"»Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death,"
40,20,19,"and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day.«"
40,20,20,"Then the mother of Zebedees sons came to him with her sons and, kneeling down, asked something of him."
40,20,21,"And he said to her, »What do you want?« She said to him, »Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.«"
40,20,22,"But Jesus answered, »You do not know what you are asking for. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?« They said to him, »We are able.«"
40,20,23,"He said to them, »You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right or my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.«"
40,20,24,"And when the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers."
40,20,25,"But Jesus called them to him and said, »You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them."
40,20,26,"Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you must be your servant."
40,20,27,"And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave"
40,20,28,"just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.«"
40,20,29,"And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him."
40,20,30,"And behold, two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, »Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!«"
40,20,31,"The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be quiet; but they cried out all the more, »Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!«"
40,20,32,"And Jesus stopped and called them, saying, »What do you want me to do for you? »"
40,20,33,"They said to him, »Lord, let our eyes be opened.«"
40,20,34,"And Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him."
40,21,1,"Now when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,"
40,21,2,"saying to them, »Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
40,21,3,"If any one says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them, and he will send them immediately.«"
40,21,4,"This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying:"
40,21,5,""
40,21,6,"The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them."
40,21,7,"They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them."
40,21,8,"And a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road."
40,21,9,"The crowds that went before him and those that followed shouted,"
40,21,10,"And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, »Who is this?«"
40,21,11,"So the crowds said, »This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.«"
40,21,12,"And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves."
40,21,13,"And he said to them, »It is written,"
40,21,14,"And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them."
40,21,15,"But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, »Hosanna to the Son of David!« they were indignant;"
40,21,16,"and they said to him, »Do you hear what these are saying?« And Jesus said to them, »Yes. Have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants you have perfected praise?«"
40,21,17,"Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and he lodged there."
40,21,18,"In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry."
40,21,19,"And seeing a fig tree by the road he went to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it, »May no fruit ever come from you again!« And immediately the fig tree withered."
40,21,20,"And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, »How did the fig tree wither away so soon?«"
40,21,21,"And Jesus answered them, »Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, it will be done."
40,21,22,"And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.«"
40,21,23,"And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, »By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?«"
40,21,24,"Jesus answered them, »I also will ask you one question; and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things."
40,21,25,"The baptism of Johnwhere was it from? From heaven or from men?« And they reasoned among themselves, saying, »If we say, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?"
40,21,26,"But if we say, From men, we are afraid of the multitude; for all hold that John was a prophet.«"
40,21,27,"So they answered Jesus, »We do not know.« And he said to them, »Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
40,21,28,"»What do you think? A man had two sons; and he went to the first and said, Son, go and work in the vineyard today."
40,21,29,"He answered, I will not, but afterward he regretted it and went."
40,21,30,"Then he went to the second and said the same thing. And he answered, I go, sir, but he did not go."
40,21,31,"Which of the two did the will of his father?« They said, »The first.« Jesus said to them, »Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you."
40,21,32,"For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him; and even when you saw it, you did not afterward repent and believe him."
40,21,33,"»Hear another parable: there was a landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a wine press in it and built a tower. And he leased it to vine dressers and went into a far country."
40,21,34,"When the harvest time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to get his fruit."
40,21,35,"And the tenants took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another."
40,21,36,"Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did the same to them."
40,21,37,"Last of all, he sent his son to them saying, They will respect my son,"
40,21,38,"But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance."
40,21,39,"So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him."
40,21,40,"Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?«"
40,21,41,"They said to him, »He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.«"
40,21,42,"Jesus said to them, »Have you never read in the Scriptures:"
40,21,43,"»Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it."
40,21,44,""
40,21,45,"When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them."
40,21,46,"But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, because they held him to be a prophet."
40,22,1,"And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying:"
40,22,2,"»The kingdom of heaven is like a king who arranged a marriage for his son,"
40,22,3,"and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; but they were not willing to come."
40,22,4,"Again, he sent out other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, »See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding.«"
40,22,5,"But they made light of it and went off, one to his own farm, another to his business."
40,22,6,"And the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them."
40,22,7,"The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city."
40,22,8,"Then he said to his servants, The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy."
40,22,9,"Go therefore to the highways, and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find."
40,22,10,"And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good; so the wedding hall was filled with guests."
40,22,11,"But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment."
40,22,12,"And he said to him, Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless."
40,22,13,"Then the king said to the attendants, Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40,22,14,"For many are called, but few are chosen.«"
40,22,15,"Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how to entangle him in his talk."
40,22,16,"And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, »Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, and you care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men."
40,22,17,"Tell us, then, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?«"
40,22,18,"But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, »Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?"
40,22,19,"Show me the money for the tax.« And they brought him a denarius."
40,22,20,"And he said to them, »Whose image and inscription is this?«"
40,22,21,"They said, »Caesars.« Then he said to them, »Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.«"
40,22,22,"When they heard it, they marveled; and they left him and went away."
40,22,23,"That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him a question,"
40,22,24,"saying, »Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother must marry the widow, and raise up children for his brother."
40,22,25,"Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and having no children, he left his wife to his brother."
40,22,26,"So the second also, and the third, down to the seventh."
40,22,27,"After them all, the woman died."
40,22,28,"Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her.«"
40,22,29,"But Jesus answered them, »You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God."
40,22,30,"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven."
40,22,31,"But as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God,"
40,22,32,"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.«"
40,22,33,"And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at his teaching."
40,22,34,"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together."
40,22,35,"And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, to test him."
40,22,36,"»Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?«"
40,22,37,"Jesus said to him, »You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind."
40,22,38,"This is the great and first commandment."
40,22,39,"And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
40,22,40,"On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.«"
40,22,41,"While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,"
40,22,42,"»What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?« They said to him, »The son of David.«"
40,22,43,"He said to them, »How is it then that David, inspired by the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,"
40,22,44,""
40,22,45,"If David then calls him Lord, how is he his son?«"
40,22,46,"And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did any one dare to ask him any more questions."
40,23,1,"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples,"
40,23,2,"»The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses seat."
40,23,3,"So you must observe and do whatever they tell you. But do not do what they do; for they preach, but do not practice."
40,23,4,"They bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on mens shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger."
40,23,5,"But they do all their works to be seen by men; for they make their phylacteries broad and the tassels of their garments long."
40,23,6,"And they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues,"
40,23,7,"and greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men, Rabbi."
40,23,8,"But you are not to be called Rabbi, for you have only one Master, and you are all brethren."
40,23,9,"And do not call anyone on earth your Father, for you have one Father, he who is in heaven."
40,23,10,"Nor are you to be called Teacher, for you have one Teacher, the Christ."
40,23,11,"He who is greatest among you shall be your servant."
40,23,12,"For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."
40,23,13,"»But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who would enter to go in."
40,23,14,""
40,23,15,"»Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel land and sea to win a single proselyte, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves."
40,23,16,"»Woe to you, blind guides, who say, If any one swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath."
40,23,17,"You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred?"
40,23,18,"And you say, If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by his oath."
40,23,19,"You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?"
40,23,20,"Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it."
40,23,21,"And he who swears by the temple, swears by it and by him who dwells in it."
40,23,22,"And he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits on it."
40,23,23,"»Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the Law, justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others."
40,23,24,"You blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!"
40,23,25,"»Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence."
40,23,26,"Blind Pharisee! First cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also."
40,23,27,"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which outwardly appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead mens bones and all uncleanness."
40,23,28,"Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness."
40,23,29,"»Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,"
40,23,30,"And you say, If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets."
40,23,31,"Thus you witness against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets."
40,23,32,"Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers guilt."
40,23,33,"You serpents! You brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell?"
40,23,34,"Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from town to town,"
40,23,35,"that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
40,23,36,"Truly, I say to you, all this will come upon this generation."
40,23,37,"»O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
40,23,38,"Behold, your house is left to you desolate."
40,23,39,"For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.«"
40,24,1,"Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came up to point out to him the buildings of the temple."
40,24,2,"But he answered them, »You see all these things, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.«"
40,24,3,"Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, »Tell us, when will this be? And what will be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?«"
40,24,4,"And Jesus answered them: »Take heed that no one deceives you."
40,24,5,"For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and will deceive many."
40,24,6,"And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet."
40,24,7,"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places."
40,24,8,"All these are the beginning of birth pains."
40,24,9,"Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and put you to death; and you will be hated by all nations for my names sake."
40,24,10,"And then many will fall away, and will betray one another, and hate one another."
40,24,11,"And many false prophets will rise up and deceive many."
40,24,12,"And because wickedness will increase, the love of most will grow cold."
40,24,13,"But he who endures to the end will be saved."
40,24,14,"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come."
40,24,15,"»So when you see standing in the holy place the abomination of desolation, spoken of by the prophet Daniel (let the reader understand)"
40,24,16,"then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains."
40,24,17,"Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house."
40,24,18,"And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes."
40,24,19,"But woe for those who are pregnant and for those who are nursing babies in those days!"
40,24,20,"Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath."
40,24,21,"For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be."
40,24,22,"And if those days had not been shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened."
40,24,23,"Then if any one says to you, Look, here is the Christ! or There he is! do not believe it."
40,24,24,"For false christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect."
40,24,25,"See, I have told you beforehand."
40,24,26,"So if they say to you, There he is, out in the desert, do not go out; or, Here he is, in the inner rooms, do not believe it."
40,24,27,"For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be."
40,24,28,"Wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together."
40,24,29,"»Immediately after the tribulation of those days"
40,24,30,"Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."
40,24,31,"And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other."
40,24,32,"»Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near."
40,24,33,"So also, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door."
40,24,34,"Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all these things take place."
40,24,35,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."
40,24,36,"»But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only."
40,24,37,"But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be."
40,24,38,"For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,"
40,24,39,"and they did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be."
40,24,40,"Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left."
40,24,41,"Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and the other left."
40,24,42,"Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming."
40,24,43,"But know this, that if the owner of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into."
40,24,44,"Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."
40,24,45,"»Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?"
40,24,46,"Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing."
40,24,47,"Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions."
40,24,48,"But if that servant is wicked and says to himself, My master is staying away a long time,"
40,24,49,"and he then begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards,"
40,24,50,"the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of,"
40,24,51,"and he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40,25,1,"»Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom."
40,25,2,"Five of them were foolish, and five were wise."
40,25,3,"For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them;"
40,25,4,"but the wise took oil in their flasks with their lamps."
40,25,5,"While the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and slept."
40,25,6,"But at midnight there was a cry: Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him."
40,25,7,"Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps."
40,25,8,"And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
40,25,9,"But the wise replied, No, there may not be enough for both us and you; go rather to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves."
40,25,10,"And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut."
40,25,11,"Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us!"
40,25,12,"But he replied, Truly, I say to you, I do not know you."
40,25,13,"Therefore keep watch, for you know neither the day nor the hour."
40,25,14,"»For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them."
40,25,15,"To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey."
40,25,16,"He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them; and he made five talents more."
40,25,17,"So also, he who had the two talents gained two more."
40,25,18,"But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground, and hid his masters money."
40,25,19,"Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them."
40,25,20,"So he who had received the five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; look, I have gained five more talents."
40,25,21,"His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your master."
40,25,22,"He also who had received the two talents came and said, Master, you delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two more talents."
40,25,23,"His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your master."
40,25,24,"Then he who had received the one talent came and said, Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed."
40,25,25,"So I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours."
40,25,26,"But his master answered him, You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed?"
40,25,27,"Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest."
40,25,28,"Therefore take the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents."
40,25,29,"For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away."
40,25,30,"And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40,25,31,"»When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne."
40,25,32,"All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats."
40,25,33,"And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left."
40,25,34,"Then the King will say to those on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:"
40,25,35,"for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you took me in,"
40,25,36,"I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me."
40,25,37,"Then the righteous will answer him, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?"
40,25,38,"When did we see you a stranger and take you in, or naked and clothe you?"
40,25,39,"When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?"
40,25,40,"And the King will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me."
40,25,41,"»Then he will say to those on his left hand, Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels:"
40,25,42,"for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,"
40,25,43,"I was a stranger and you did not take me in, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me."
40,25,44,"Then they also will answer, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?"
40,25,45,"Then he will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me."
40,25,46,"And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.«"
40,26,1,"When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,"
40,26,2,"»You know that after two days is the Passover, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.«"
40,26,3,"Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,"
40,26,4,"and they plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him."
40,26,5,"But they said, »Not during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people.«"
40,26,6,"Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,"
40,26,7,"a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head as he sat at the table."
40,26,8,"But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, »Why this waste?"
40,26,9,"For this perfume might have been sold for a high price and given to the poor.«"
40,26,10,"But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, »Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me."
40,26,11,"For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me."
40,26,12,"For in pouring this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial."
40,26,13,"Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.«"
40,26,14,"Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests"
40,26,15,"and said, »What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?« And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver."
40,26,16,"And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him."
40,26,17,"Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, »Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?«"
40,26,18,"He said, »Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, my time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.«"
40,26,19,"So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover."
40,26,20,"When evening had come, he sat at the table with the twelve."
40,26,21,"And as they were eating, he said, »Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.«"
40,26,22,"And they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another, »Is it I, Lord?«"
40,26,23,"He answered, »He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me."
40,26,24,"The Son of Man goes just as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.«"
40,26,25,"Then Judas, who was betraying him, answered, »Rabbi, is it I?« He said to him, »You have said it.«"
40,26,26,"Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, »Take, eat; this is my body.«"
40,26,27,"Then he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, »Drink from it, all of you."
40,26,28,"For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."
40,26,29,"I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.«"
40,26,30,"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
40,26,31,"Then Jesus said to them, »You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written,"
40,26,32,"But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.«"
40,26,33,"Peter declared to him, »Even if all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.«"
40,26,34,"Jesus said to him, »Truly I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.«"
40,26,35,"Peter said to him, »Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you.« And so said all the disciples."
40,26,36,"Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, »Sit here while I go over there and pray.«"
40,26,37,"He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled."
40,26,38,"Then he said to them, »My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me.«"
40,26,39,"And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, »O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.«"
40,26,40,"Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, »So, could you not watch with me one hour?"
40,26,41,"Watch and pray, so that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.«"
40,26,42,"Again, a second time, he went away and prayed, »O my Father, if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink it, your will be done.«"
40,26,43,"And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy."
40,26,44,"So he left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words."
40,26,45,"Then he came to the disciples and said to them, »Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
40,26,46,"Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.«"
40,26,47,"While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people."
40,26,48,"Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, »The one I kiss is the man; seize him.«"
40,26,49,"And at once he went up to Jesus and said, »Greetings, Rabbi!« and kissed him."
40,26,50,"Jesus said to him, »Friend, why are you here?« Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him."
40,26,51,"And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear."
40,26,52,"But Jesus said to him, »Put your sword back in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
40,26,53,"Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?"
40,26,54,"But how then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen in this way?«"
40,26,55,"At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me."
40,26,56,"But all this has taken place, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.« Then all the disciples forsook him and fled."
40,26,57,"And those who had seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled."
40,26,58,"But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the end."
40,26,59,"Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,"
40,26,60,"but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward"
40,26,61,"and said, »This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.«"
40,26,62,"And the high priest stood up and said, »Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?«"
40,26,63,"But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, »I charge you under oath by the living God: tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.«"
40,26,64,"Jesus said to him, »It is as you said. But I say to you,"
40,26,65,"Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, »He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard his blasphemy."
40,26,66,"What do you think?« They answered, »He is worthy of death.«"
40,26,67,"Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists; and others slapped him,"
40,26,68,"saying, »Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck you?«"
40,26,69,"Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, »You also were with Jesus of Galilee.«"
40,26,70,"But he denied it before them all, saying, »I do not know what you are talking about.«"
40,26,71,"And when he went out to the gateway, another girl saw him and said to the people there, »This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.«"
40,26,72,"But again he denied it with an oath, »I do not know the man!«"
40,26,73,"After a little while those who stood by came up and said to Peter, »Surely you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.«"
40,26,74,"Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, »I do not know the man.« And immediately the rooster crowed."
40,26,75,"And Peter remembered the word Jesus had said, »Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.« So he went out and wept bitterly."
40,27,1,"When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death."
40,27,2,"And they bound him, and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor."
40,27,3,"When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,"
40,27,4,"saying, »I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.« And they said, »What is that to us? You see to it!«"
40,27,5,"Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself."
40,27,6,"But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, »It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are the money of blood.«"
40,27,7,"So they took counsel, and bought with them the potters field, to bury strangers in."
40,27,8,"Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day."
40,27,9,"Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, »And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,"
40,27,10,"and they gave them for the potters field, as the Lord directed me.«"
40,27,11,"Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, »Are you the king of the Jews?« So Jesus said to him, »It is as you say.«"
40,27,12,"But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer."
40,27,13,"Then Pilate said to him, »Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?«"
40,27,14,"But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly."
40,27,15,"Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted."
40,27,16,"And at that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas."
40,27,17,"So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, »Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?«"
40,27,18,"For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed him over."
40,27,19,"While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, »Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered greatly today in a dream because of him.«"
40,27,20,"But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus."
40,27,21,"The governor answered them, »Which of the two do you want me to release to you?« They said, »Barabbas!«"
40,27,22,"Pilate said to them, »Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?« They all said, »Let him be crucified!«"
40,27,23,"And he said, »Why, what evil has he done?« But they shouted all the more, »Let him be crucified!«"
40,27,24,"When Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, »I am innocent of this mans blood. See to it yourselves.«"
40,27,25,"And all the people answered, »His blood be on us and on our children!«"
40,27,26,"Then he released Barabbas to them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified."
40,27,27,"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around him."
40,27,28,"And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,"
40,27,29,"and when they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they bowed the knee before him and mocked him, saying, »Hail, King of the Jews!«"
40,27,30,"And they spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head."
40,27,31,"And when they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him."
40,27,32,"Now as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to carry his cross."
40,27,33,"And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull),"
40,27,34,"they offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it."
40,27,35,"And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots;"
40,27,36,"and sitting down, they kept watch over him there."
40,27,37,"And they put up over his head the charge written against him:"
40,27,38,"Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left."
40,27,39,"And those who passed by hurled insults at him, wagging their heads"
40,27,40,"and saying, »You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.«"
40,27,41,"So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,"
40,27,42,"»He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him."
40,27,43,"He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, I am the Son of God.«"
40,27,44,"And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way."
40,27,45,"Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land."
40,27,46,"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, »Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?« that is, »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«"
40,27,47,"When some of those standing there heard this, they said, »This man is calling Elijah.«"
40,27,48,"Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a reed, and offered it to him to drink."
40,27,49,"The rest said, »Let him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save him.«"
40,27,50,"And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit."
40,27,51,"And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split;"
40,27,52,"the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,"
40,27,53,"and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many."
40,27,54,"So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were terrified, and said, »Truly this was the Son of God!«"
40,27,55,"And many women were also there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him;"
40,27,56,"among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees sons."
40,27,57,"And when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself also become a disciple of Jesus."
40,27,58,"He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him."
40,27,59,"When Joseph took the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"
40,27,60,"and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed."
40,27,61,"Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb."
40,27,62,"The next day, the one after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered to Pilate"
40,27,63,"and said, »Sir, we remember how that deceiver said, while he was still alive, After three days I will rise again."
40,27,64,"Therefore order that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away, and tell the people, He has risen from the dead. So the last deception will be worse than the first.«"
40,27,65,"Pilate said to them, »You have a guard; go your way, make it as secure as you know how.«"
40,27,66,"So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard."
40,28,1,"Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb."
40,28,2,"And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it."
40,28,3,"His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow."
40,28,4,"And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men."
40,28,5,"But the angel said to the women, »Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified."
40,28,6,"He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay."
40,28,7,"Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead. And behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told you.«"
40,28,8,"So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples."
40,28,9,"And behold, Jesus met them and said, »Hail!« And they came to him and took hold of his feet and worshipped him."
40,28,10,"Then Jesus said to them, »Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee; and there they will see me.«"
40,28,11,"Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened."
40,28,12,"When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,"
40,28,13,"and said, »Tell them, His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep."
40,28,14,"And if this comes to the governors ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.«"
40,28,15,"So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day."
40,28,16,"Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them."
40,28,17,"When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted."
40,28,18,"And Jesus came and said to them, »All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
40,28,19,"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,"
40,28,20,"teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.«"
41,1,1,"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."
41,1,2,"As it is written in Isaiah the prophet:"
41,1,3,""
41,1,4,"John came baptizing in the wilderness, and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins."
41,1,5,"And all the land of Judea, and the people from Jerusalem, went out to him and they were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins."
41,1,6,"Now John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey."
41,1,7,"And he preached, saying, »After me comes One who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."
41,1,8,"I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.«"
41,1,9,"In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan."
41,1,10,"And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove."
41,1,11,"And a voice came from heaven, »You are my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«"
41,1,12,"The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness."
41,1,13,"And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him."
41,1,14,"Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,"
41,1,15,"and saying, »The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel.«"
41,1,16,"And as he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the Sea; for they were fishermen."
41,1,17,"And Jesus said to them, »Come follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.«"
41,1,18,"And immediately they left their nets and followed him."
41,1,19,"When he had gone a little farther from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets."
41,1,20,"And immediately he called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him."
41,1,21,"And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught."
41,1,22,"And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes."
41,1,23,"Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,"
41,1,24,"saying, »Let us alone! What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you arethe Holy One of God!«"
41,1,25,"But Jesus rebuked him, saying, »Be quiet, and come out of him!«"
41,1,26,"And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him."
41,1,27,"And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, »What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.«"
41,1,28,"And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee."
41,1,29,"As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John, and entered the house of Simon and Andrew."
41,1,30,"Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her."
41,1,31,"So he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her. And she served them."
41,1,32,"Now at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed."
41,1,33,"And the whole city was gathered together at the door."
41,1,34,"And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him."
41,1,35,"Now in the morning, a long while before daylight, he rose and went out to a solitary place, and there he prayed."
41,1,36,"And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,"
41,1,37,"and when they found him, they said to him, »Everyone is looking for you.«"
41,1,38,"And he said to them, »Let us go on to the next towns, so I may preach there also; for that is why I have come.«"
41,1,39,"And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons."
41,1,40,"Then a leper came to him, imploring him, kneeling down to him and saying to him, »If you are willing, you can make me clean.«"
41,1,41,"And Jesus, moved with compassion, put out his hand and touched him, and said to him, »I am willing; be clean.«"
41,1,42,"And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean."
41,1,43,"And he strictly warned him and sent him away at once,"
41,1,44,"and he said to him, »See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.«"
41,1,45,"But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was outside in the deserted places; and people came to him from every quarter."
41,2,1,"And when he entered Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was home."
41,2,2,"And many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive them, not even near the door. And he preached the word to them."
41,2,3,"Then they came to him, bringing a paralytic carried by four men."
41,2,4,"And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above him; and when they had broken through, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying."
41,2,5,"When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, »Son, your sins are forgiven.«"
41,2,6,"Now some of the scribes were sitting there, reasoning in their hearts,"
41,2,7,"»Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?«"
41,2,8,"And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, he said to them, »Why do you reason about these things in your hearts?"
41,2,9,"Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise, take up your pallet and walk?"
41,2,10,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins«he said to the paralytic,"
41,2,11,"»I say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home.«"
41,2,12,"And he rose, and immediately took up the pallet and went out in the sight of them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, »We never saw anything like this!«"
41,2,13,"Then he went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them."
41,2,14,"As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, »Follow me.« So he rose and followed him."
41,2,15,"And as he sat at table in Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him."
41,2,16,"And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, »Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?«"
41,2,17,"And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, »Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.«"
41,2,18,"Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, »Why do Johns disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?«"
41,2,19,"And Jesus said to them, »Can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
41,2,20,"But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day."
41,2,21,"»No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, and the tear is made worse."
41,2,22,"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.«"
41,2,23,"One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain."
41,2,24,"And the Pharisees said to him, »Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?«"
41,2,25,"But he said to them, »Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those who were with him:"
41,2,26,"how he entered the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave some to those who were with him?«"
41,2,27,"And he said to them, »The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
41,2,28,"So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.«"
41,3,1,"He entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand."
41,3,2,"And they watched him closely, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him."
41,3,3,"And he said to the man who had the withered hand, »Come here.«"
41,3,4,"Then he said to them, »Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?« But they kept silent."
41,3,5,"And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, »Stretch out your hand.« He stretched it out, and his hand was restored."
41,3,6,"Then the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him."
41,3,7,"Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed; also from Judea"
41,3,8,"and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how many things he was doing, came to him."
41,3,9,"And he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they should crush him."
41,3,10,"For he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him."
41,3,11,"And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, »You are the Son of God.«"
41,3,12,"But he strictly ordered them not to make him known."
41,3,13,"And he went up on the mountain, and called to him those he himself wanted. And they came to him."
41,3,14,"Then he appointed twelve, that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach,"
41,3,15,"and to have authority to cast out the demons:"
41,3,16,"Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;"
41,3,17,"James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, »Sons of Thunder«;"
41,3,18,"Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot;"
41,3,19,"and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him."
41,3,20,"Then he went home; and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat."
41,3,21,"When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, »He is out of his mind.«"
41,3,22,"And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, »He is possessed by Beelzebub, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.«"
41,3,23,"So he called them to himself and said to them in parables: »How can Satan cast out Satan?"
41,3,24,"If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand."
41,3,25,"And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand."
41,3,26,"And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end."
41,3,27,"No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house."
41,3,28,"Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;"
41,3,29,"but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin«"
41,3,30,"because they said, »He has an unclean spirit.«"
41,3,31,"Then his brothers and his mother came. And standing outside they sent to him, and called him."
41,3,32,"And a crowd was sitting around him; and they said to him, »Your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.«"
41,3,33,"And he replied, »Who are my mother and my brothers?«"
41,3,34,"And he looked at those who sat in a circle around him, and said, »Here are my mother and my brothers!"
41,3,35,"Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother.«"
41,4,1,"Again he began to teach by the sea. and a very large crowd gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land."
41,4,2,"Then he taught them many things by parables, and said to them in his teaching:"
41,4,3,"»Listen! A sower went out to sow."
41,4,4,"And as he sowed the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it."
41,4,5,"Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil."
41,4,6,"But when the sun came up it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away."
41,4,7,"Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain."
41,4,8,"But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced thirtyfold, sixty, and a hundred.«"
41,4,9,"And he said, »He who has ears to hear, let him hear.«"
41,4,10,"And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables."
41,4,11,"And he said to them, »To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those outside everything is in parables;"
41,4,12,"so that"
41,4,13,"And he said to them, »Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?"
41,4,14,"The sower sows the word."
41,4,15,"And these are the ones along the path where the word is sown. When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in them."
41,4,16,"And these likewise are the ones sown on rocky ground who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;"
41,4,17,"and they have no root in themselves, but endure for only a time. Then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away."
41,4,18,"And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word,"
41,4,19,"but the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."
41,4,20,"But these are the ones sown on good soil, those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit thirtyfold, sixty, and a hundred.«"
41,4,21,"And he said to them, »Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand?"
41,4,22,"For there is nothing hidden, except to be revealed; nor is anything secret, but that it should come to light."
41,4,23,"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.«"
41,4,24,"Then he said to them, »Take heed what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you; and more will be given you."
41,4,25,"For whoever has, to him will more be given; and whoever does not have, from him even what he has will be taken away.«"
41,4,26,"And he said, »The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground,"
41,4,27,"and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how."
41,4,28,"All by itself the earth produces grainfirst the blade, then the head, then the full kernel in the head."
41,4,29,"But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.«"
41,4,30,"And he said, »With what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?"
41,4,31,"It is like a mustard seed which, when it is sown on the ground, is the smallest of all seeds in the earth;"
41,4,32,"yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.«"
41,4,33,"With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it."
41,4,34,"But without a parable he did not speak to them. And when they were alone, he explained everything to his own disciples."
41,4,35,"On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, »Let us go over to the other side.«"
41,4,36,"And leaving the crowd, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him."
41,4,37,"And a great storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling."
41,4,38,"But he was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. And they woke him and said to him, »Teacher, do you not care if we perish?«"
41,4,39,"Then he rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, »Peace! Be still!« And the wind ceased and there was a great calm."
41,4,40,"He said to them, »Why are you so afraid? Have you no faith?«"
41,4,41,"And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, »Who is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!«"
41,5,1,"They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes."
41,5,2,"And when he had come out of the boat, there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,"
41,5,3,"who lived among the tombs; and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain,"
41,5,4,"for he had often been bound with shackles and chains. But the chains he wrenched apart, and the shackles he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him."
41,5,5,"Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out, and cutting himself with stones."
41,5,6,"And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and worshipped him."
41,5,7,"And crying out with a loud voice, he said, »What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me.«"
41,5,8,"For he had said to him, »Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!«"
41,5,9,"Then Jesus asked him, »What is your name?« And he replied, »My name is Legion, for we are many.«"
41,5,10,"And he begged him eagerly not to send them out of the country."
41,5,11,"Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside."
41,5,12,"So all the demons begged him, »Send us to the swine, that we may enter them.«"
41,5,13,"So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the sea."
41,5,14,"So those who fed the swine fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And people went out to see what it was that had happened."
41,5,15,"And they came to Jesus, and saw the man who had been possessed sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had had the legion; and they were afraid."
41,5,16,"And those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and about the swine."
41,5,17,"Then they began to plead with Jesus to depart from their region."
41,5,18,"And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged him that he might be with him."
41,5,19,"Jesus did not let him, but said, »Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.«"
41,5,20,"And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and all men marveled."
41,5,21,"And when Jesus had crossed over again by the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him; and he was by the sea."
41,5,22,"Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name. And seeing him, he fell at his feet,"
41,5,23,"and pleaded earnestly with him, saying, »My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be healed, and live.«"
41,5,24,"So Jesus went with him."
41,5,25,"And there was a woman who had endured a flow of blood for twelve years,"
41,5,26,"and she had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she owned, and was no better but rather grew worse."
41,5,27,"When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment."
41,5,28,"For she said, »If I touch even his clothes, I shall be made well.«"
41,5,29,"And immediately the bleeding stopped; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease."
41,5,30,"And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and said, »Who touched my clothes?«"
41,5,31,"And his disciples said to him, »You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, Who touched me?«"
41,5,32,"And he looked around to see who had done it."
41,5,33,"But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him in fear and trembling and told him the whole truth."
41,5,34,"And he said to her, »Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your disease.«"
41,5,35,"While he was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue's house who said, »Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?«"
41,5,36,"But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, »Do not be afraid; only believe.«"
41,5,37,"And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James."
41,5,38,"When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, he saw a tumult, and people weeping and wailing loudly."
41,5,39,"And when he came in, he said to them, »Why make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeping.«"
41,5,40,"And they laughed at him. But after he put them all outside, he took the child's father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was."
41,5,41,"He took her by the hand and said to her, »Talitha cumi!« which means, »Little girl, I say to you, arise.«"
41,5,42,"Immediately the girl stood up and walked (she was twelve years of age). And they were overcome with great amazement."
41,5,43,"He strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat."
41,6,1,"He went away from there and came to his own country, and his disciples followed him."
41,6,2,"And when the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many who heard him were astonished, saying, »Where did this man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to him, that such mighty works are performed by his hands!"
41,6,3,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us?« And they took offense at him."
41,6,4,"But Jesus said to them, »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house.«"
41,6,5,"Now he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them."
41,6,6,"And he marveled because of their unbelief. Then he went around the villages teaching."
41,6,7,"And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits."
41,6,8,"He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staffno bag, no bread, no money in their belts"
41,6,9,"but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics."
41,6,10,"And he said to them, »Where you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place."
41,6,11,"And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.«"
41,6,12,"So they went out and preached that people should repent."
41,6,13,"And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them."
41,6,14,"King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some said, »John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these powers are at work in him.«"
41,6,15,"But others said, »It is Elijah.« And others said, »It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.«"
41,6,16,"But when Herod heard, he said, »This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!«"
41,6,17,"For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her."
41,6,18,"For John had said to Herod, »It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.«"
41,6,19,"And Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not,"
41,6,20,"for Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly."
41,6,21,"But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his high officers and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee."
41,6,22,"And when the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, »Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.«"
41,6,23,"And he vowed to her, »Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.«"
41,6,24,"So she went out and said to her mother, »What shall I ask?« And she said, »The head of John the Baptist!«"
41,6,25,"Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, »I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.«"
41,6,26,"And the king was exceedingly sorry; but, because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her."
41,6,27,"And immediately the king sent an executioner and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison,"
41,6,28,"and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother."
41,6,29,"When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb."
41,6,30,"The apostles gathered to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught."
41,6,31,"And he said to them, »Come away by yourselves to a lonely place and rest a while.« For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat."
41,6,32,"So they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves."
41,6,33,"But many saw them going, and knew them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns, and got there ahead of them."
41,6,34,"When Jesus went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things."
41,6,35,"When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him and said, »This is a deserted place, and already the hour is late."
41,6,36,"Send them away, so they can go to the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves something to eat.«"
41,6,37,"But he answered them, »You give them something to eat.« And they said to him, »Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give it to them to eat?«"
41,6,38,"But he said to them, »How many loaves do you have? Go and see.« And when they found out they said, »Five, and two fish.«"
41,6,39,"Then he commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass."
41,6,40,"So they sat down in groups, of hundreds and fifties."
41,6,41,"And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and he divided the two fish among them all."
41,6,42,"And they all ate and were satisfied."
41,6,43,"And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish."
41,6,44,"Now those who had eaten the loaves were about five thousand men."
41,6,45,"Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd."
41,6,46,"And after he had left them, he went up on the mountain to pray."
41,6,47,"When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on land."
41,6,48,"And he saw the disciples straining at the oars, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He was about to pass by them,"
41,6,49,"but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;"
41,6,50,"for they all saw him, and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, »Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.«"
41,6,51,"Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were completely amazed,"
41,6,52,"for they had not understood about the loaves, because their hearts were hardened."
41,6,53,"When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there."
41,6,54,"And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,"
41,6,55,"and ran about that whole region, and began to carry those who were sick around on pallets to wherever they heard he was."
41,6,56,"Wherever he entered, into villages, cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched him were made well."
41,7,1,"Now when the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered together to him,"
41,7,2,"they saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed."
41,7,3,"(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands in a special way, holding the tradition of the elders."
41,7,4,"When they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash themselves. And there are many other traditions which they observe, the washing of cups and pitchers and copper vessels. )"
41,7,5,"The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, »Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with impure hands?«"
41,7,6,"And he said to them, »Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites; as it is written:"
41,7,7,""
41,7,8,"You let go of the commandment of God, and hold on to the tradition of men.«"
41,7,9,"And he said to them, »You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God, in order to keep your tradition!"
41,7,10,"For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death."
41,7,11,"But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban (that is, a gift devoted to God),"
41,7,12,"then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother,"
41,7,13,"thus making void the word of God through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such things you do.«"
41,7,14,"And he called all the people to him again, and said to them, »Hear me, everyone, and understand:"
41,7,15,"there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him.«"
41,7,16,""
41,7,17,"When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable."
41,7,18,"So he said to them, »Are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him,"
41,7,19,"since it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and so passes on?« (Thus he declared all foods clean.)"
41,7,20,"And he said, »What comes out of a man is what defiles a man."
41,7,21,"For from within, out of the heart of men, come evil thoughts, fornications, theft, murder, adultery,"
41,7,22,"coveting, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness."
41,7,23,"All these evil things come from within, and they defile a man.«"
41,7,24,"From there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house, and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not be hidden."
41,7,25,"But a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard about him, and she came and fell at his feet."
41,7,26,"Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter."
41,7,27,"And he said to her, »Let the children first be fed, for it is not right to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs.«"
41,7,28,"But she answered him, »Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.«"
41,7,29,"Then he said to her, »For this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.«"
41,7,30,"She went home, and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone."
41,7,31,"Then he departed from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decapolis."
41,7,32,"Then they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they begged him to put his hand on him."
41,7,33,"And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue."
41,7,34,"And looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him, »Ephphatha,« that is, »Be opened.«"
41,7,35,"And"
41,7,36,"And he commanded them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more widely they proclaimed it."
41,7,37,"And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, »He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.«"
41,8,1,"In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him, and said to them,"
41,8,2,"»I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat."
41,8,3,"And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come a long distance.«"
41,8,4,"And his disciples answered him, »How can one feed these men with bread here in the desert?«"
41,8,5,"And he asked them, »How many loaves do you have?« They said, »Seven.«"
41,8,6,"So he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd."
41,8,7,"They also had a few small fish; and having blessed them, he commanded that these also should be set before them."
41,8,8,"They ate, and were satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over."
41,8,9,"About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away,"
41,8,10,"he immediately got into the boat with his disciples, and went to the region of Dalmanutha."
41,8,11,"The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, to test him."
41,8,12,"And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, »Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.«"
41,8,13,"And he left them, and getting into the boat again he departed to the other side."
41,8,14,"Now the disciples had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat."
41,8,15,"And he cautioned them, saying, »Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.«"
41,8,16,"And they discussed it with one another, saying, »It is because we have no bread.«"
41,8,17,"Being aware of it, Jesus said to them, »Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?"
41,8,18,"Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?"
41,8,19,"When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?« They said to him, »Twelve.«"
41,8,20,"»And when I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of pieces did you take up?« And they said, »Seven.«"
41,8,21,"He said to them, »Do you not yet understand?«"
41,8,22,"And they came to Bethsaida; and some people brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him."
41,8,23,"So he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. And when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands on him, he asked him »Do you see anything?«"
41,8,24,"And he looked up and said, »I see men; but they look like trees, walking.«"
41,8,25,"Then he put his hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored, and saw everything clearly."
41,8,26,"And he sent him away to his home, saying, »Do not even go into the village.«"
41,8,27,"And Jesus went on with his disciples, to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples, »Who do men say that I am?«"
41,8,28,"They replied, »Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.«"
41,8,29,"And he asked them, »But who do you say that I am?« Peter answered him, »You are the Christ.«"
41,8,30,"And he charged them to tell no one about him."
41,8,31,"And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again."
41,8,32,"He spoke plainly about this. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him."
41,8,33,"But when he had turned around and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter, and said, »Get behind me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.«"
41,8,34,"And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
41,8,35,"For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospels will save it."
41,8,36,"For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?"
41,8,37,"Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?"
41,8,38,"For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.«"
41,9,1,"And he said to them, »Truly, I say to you that there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power.«"
41,9,2,"After six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves. And he was transfigured before them,"
41,9,3,"and his clothes became dazzling, exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth could bleach them."
41,9,4,"And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus."
41,9,5,"And Peter said to Jesus, »Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernaclesone for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«"
41,9,6,"For he did not know what to say, for they were greatly afraid."
41,9,7,"And a cloud came and overshadowed them; and a voice came out of the cloud, »This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!«"
41,9,8,"Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only."
41,9,9,"And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead."
41,9,10,"So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant."
41,9,11,"And they asked him, »Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?«"
41,9,12,"Then he said to them, »Elijah does come first and restores all things. And how is it written of the Son of Man, that he must suffer many things and be treated with contempt?"
41,9,13,"But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wished, as it is written of him.«"
41,9,14,"And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them."
41,9,15,"Immediately, when they saw him, all the people were greatly amazed, and ran to him and greeted him."
41,9,16,"And he asked them, »What are you discussing with them?«"
41,9,17,"And one of the crowd answered him, »Teacher, I brought my son to you, who has a mute spirit."
41,9,18,"And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to cast out the spirit, but they could not.«"
41,9,19,"He answered him, »O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.«"
41,9,20,"And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth."
41,9,21,"And Jesus asked his father, »How long has he been like this?« And he said, »From childhood."
41,9,22,"And it has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us.«"
41,9,23,"Jesus said to him, »If you can, all things are possible to him who believes.«"
41,9,24,"Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, »I believe; help my unbelief!«"
41,9,25,"And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, »You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again.«"
41,9,26,"And the spirit cried out, convulsed him terribly, and came out. And the boy was like a corpse; so that many of them said, »He is dead.«"
41,9,27,"But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose."
41,9,28,"And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, »Why could we not cast it out?«"
41,9,29,"And he said to them, »This kind can only come out by prayer.«"
41,9,30,"Then they departed from there and passed through Galilee, and he did not want anyone to know it."
41,9,31,"For he was teaching his disciples and said to them, »The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and when he is killed, after three days he will rise.«"
41,9,32,"But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to ask him."
41,9,33,"And they came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, »What were you discussing on the road?«"
41,9,34,"But they kept silent; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest."
41,9,35,"And he sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, »If anyone desires to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.«"
41,9,36,"And he took a little child, and put him in the midst of them. And taking him in his arms, he said to them,"
41,9,37,"»Whoever receives one of these little children in my name receives me; and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me.«"
41,9,38,"John said to him, »Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your name and we forbade him, because he was not one of us.«"
41,9,39,"But Jesus said, »Do not forbid him, for no one who does a miracle in my name can soon afterward speak evil of me."
41,9,40,"For he who is not against us is for us."
41,9,41,"For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you belong to Christ, will by no means lose his reward."
41,9,42,"»Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea."
41,9,43,"If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, to the fire that shall never be quenched."
41,9,44,""
41,9,45,"And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell."
41,9,46,""
41,9,47,"And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,"
41,9,48,"where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched."
41,9,49,"For every one will be salted with fire."
41,9,50,"Salt is good, but if the salt loses its flavor, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.«"
41,10,1,"Then he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan. And crowds gathered to him again; and again, as his custom was, he taught them."
41,10,2,"The Pharisees came and in order to test him asked, »Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?«"
41,10,3,"He answered them, »What did Moses command you?«"
41,10,4,"They said, »Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce, and to put her away.«"
41,10,5,"But Jesus said to them, »Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment."
41,10,6,"But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female."
41,10,7,"For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,"
41,10,8,"and the two shall become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh."
41,10,9,"Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.«"
41,10,10,"In the house his disciples also asked him again about this matter."
41,10,11,"So he said to them, »Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her."
41,10,12,"And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.«"
41,10,13,"And they were bringing children to him, that he might touch them; but the disciples rebuked them."
41,10,14,"But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, »Let the little children come to me; and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God."
41,10,15,"Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it.«"
41,10,16,"And he took them in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them."
41,10,17,"And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him, and asked him, »Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?«"
41,10,18,"And Jesus said to him, »Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone."
41,10,19,"You know the commandments: Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.«"
41,10,20,"And he said to him, »Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.«"
41,10,21,"Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, »You lack one thing; go and sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.«"
41,10,22,"But he fell sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions."
41,10,23,"Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, »How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!«"
41,10,24,"And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, »Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!"
41,10,25,"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.«"
41,10,26,"And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, »Then who can be saved?«"
41,10,27,"Jesus looked at them and said, »With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.«"
41,10,28,"Peter began to say to him, »See, we have left everything and followed you.«"
41,10,29,"Jesus said, »Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel,"
41,10,30,"who will not receive a hundredfold now in this timehouse and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come, eternal life."
41,10,31,"But many who are first will be last, and the last first.«"
41,10,32,"They were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them; and they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And he took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was to happen to him."
41,10,33,"»Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles;"
41,10,34,"and they will mock him, and spit on him, and scourge him, and kill him. And after three days he will rise.«"
41,10,35,"Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and said, »Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.«"
41,10,36,"And he said to them, »What do you want me to do for you?«"
41,10,37,"And they said to him, »Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your glory.«"
41,10,38,"But Jesus said to them, »You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?«"
41,10,39,"They said to him, »We are able.« So Jesus said to them, »You will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the baptism I am baptized with you will be baptized;"
41,10,40,"but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.«"
41,10,41,"And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant with James and John."
41,10,42,"But Jesus called them to himself and said to them, »You know that those who are considered rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them."
41,10,43,"But it shall not be so among you. But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,"
41,10,44,"and whoever wants to be first among you must be slave of all."
41,10,45,"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.«"
41,10,46,"And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, Bartimaeus, a blind man, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside begging."
41,10,47,"And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, »Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!«"
41,10,48,"Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he cried out all the more, »Son of David, have mercy on me!«"
41,10,49,"So Jesus stopped and said, »Call him.« And they called the blind man, saying to him, »Take heart; rise, he is calling you.«"
41,10,50,"And throwing aside his garment, he rose and came to Jesus."
41,10,51,"And Jesus said to him, »What do you want me to do for you?« And the blind man said to him, »Master, let me receive my sight.«"
41,10,52,"Then Jesus said to him, »Go your way; your faith has made you well.« And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the road."
41,11,1,"And when they drew near Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,"
41,11,2,"and said to them, »Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it."
41,11,3,"If anyone says to you, Why are you doing this? say, The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.«"
41,11,4,"They went away and found a colt tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied it."
41,11,5,"And some of those who stood there said to them, »What are you doing, untying the colt?«"
41,11,6,"They answered as Jesus had told them to, and they let them go."
41,11,7,"Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments on it, and he sat on it."
41,11,8,"And many spread their garments on the road, and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields."
41,11,9,"And those who went before and those who followed cried out,"
41,11,10,""
41,11,11,"Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the temple. And when he had looked round at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve."
41,11,12,"On the next day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry."
41,11,13,"And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs."
41,11,14,"And he said to it, »May no one ever eat fruit from you again.« And his disciples heard it."
41,11,15,"So they came to Jerusalem. And Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves."
41,11,16,"And he would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple."
41,11,17,"And as he taught them, he said, »Is it not written,"
41,11,18,"And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought a way to destroy him; for they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching."
41,11,19,"When evening came, they went out of the city."
41,11,20,"In the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots."
41,11,21,"Peter remembered and said to him, »Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered.«"
41,11,22,"And Jesus answered them, »Have faith in God."
41,11,23,"Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him."
41,11,24,"Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours."
41,11,25,"And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses."
41,11,26,""
41,11,27,"Then they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him."
41,11,28,"And they said to him, »By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority to do them?«"
41,11,29,"Jesus said to them, »I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
41,11,30,"The baptism of Johnwas it from heaven or from men? Answer me.«"
41,11,31,"And they reasoned among themselves, »If we say, From heaven, He will say, Why then did you not believe him?"
41,11,32,"But if we say, From men«they feared the people, for all held that John was a real prophet."
41,11,33,"So they answered Jesus, »We do not know.« And Jesus said to them, »Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.«"
41,12,1,"Then he began to speak to them in parables: »A man planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a place for the wine vat and built a tower. And he leased it to vine dressers and went into a far country."
41,12,2,"At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants, to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard."
41,12,3,"And they took him and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed."
41,12,4,"Again he sent to them another servant, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully."
41,12,5,"And he sent another, and him they killed; and so with many others, some they beat and some they killed."
41,12,6,"He still had one left to send, a beloved son. He sent him to them last, saying, They will respect my son."
41,12,7,"But those tenants said to one another, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
41,12,8,"So they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard."
41,12,9,"What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and give the vineyard to others."
41,12,10,"Have you not read this Scripture:"
41,12,11,""
41,12,12,"And they sought to arrest him, but feared the multitude, for they knew he had spoken the parable against them. So they left him and went away."
41,12,13,"Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch him in his words."
41,12,14,"When they came, they said to him, »Teacher, we know that you are true, and care about no man; for you do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
41,12,15,"Should we pay them, or should we not?« But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, »Why do you put me to the test? Bring me a denarius, and let me look at it.«"
41,12,16,"And they brought one. And he said to them, »Whose likeness and inscription is this?« They said to him, »Caesar's.«"
41,12,17,"Jesus said to them, »Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.« And they were amazed at him."
41,12,18,"Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him; and they asked him a question, saying:"
41,12,19,"»Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the wife, and raise up children for his brother."
41,12,20,"Now there were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no children."
41,12,21,"And the second took her, and he died; leaving behind no children. And the third likewise."
41,12,22,"So the seven had her and left no children. Last of all the woman died also."
41,12,23,"In the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.«"
41,12,24,"Jesus said to them, »Is not this why you are wrong, that you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?"
41,12,25,"For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven."
41,12,26,"And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?"
41,12,27,"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are greatly mistaken.«"
41,12,28,"And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him, »Which commandment is the first of all?«"
41,12,29,"Jesus answered, »The first is: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord."
41,12,30,"And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength."
41,12,31,"The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.«"
41,12,32,"And the scribe said to him, »You are right, Teacher; you have well said that God is one, and there is no other but he;"
41,12,33,"and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.«"
41,12,34,"And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, »You are not far from the kingdom of God.« And after that no one dared to ask him any question."
41,12,35,"And Jesus said, while he taught in the temple, »How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?"
41,12,36,"David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared:"
41,12,37,"Therefore David himself calls him Lord; how is he then his son?« And the common people heard him gladly."
41,12,38,"And in his teaching he said, »Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes, and to have salutations in the market places"
41,12,39,"and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,"
41,12,40,"who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.«"
41,12,41,"And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the multitude putting money into the treasury. Many people who were rich put in large sums."
41,12,42,"And a poor widow came, and put in two copper coins, which make a penny."
41,12,43,"And he called his disciples to him, and said to them, »Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury."
41,12,44,"For they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everythingall she had to live on.«"
41,13,1,"And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, »Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!«"
41,13,2,"And Jesus said to him, »Do you see all these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.«"
41,13,3,"Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,"
41,13,4,"»Tell us, when will this be? And what will be the sign when these things are all to be fulfilled?«"
41,13,5,"And Jesus began to say to them: »Take heed that no one deceives you."
41,13,6,"Many will come in my name, saying, I am he, and will deceive many."
41,13,7,"When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; such things must happen, but the end is not yet."
41,13,8,"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and troubles. These are the beginning of birth pains."
41,13,9,"But watch out for yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be beaten in the synagogues. You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them."
41,13,10,"And the gospel must first be preached to all nations."
41,13,11,"And when they bring you to trial and deliver you up, do not worry beforehand what you are to say. But say whatever is given you in that hour; for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit."
41,13,12,"Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death."
41,13,13,"And you will be hated by all men for my name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved."
41,13,14,"»When you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains."
41,13,15,"Let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter to take anything out of his house."
41,13,16,"And let him who is in the field not go back to get his cloak."
41,13,17,"But woe for those who are pregnant and those who are nursing babies in those days!"
41,13,18,"Pray that it may not happen in winter."
41,13,19,"For in those days there will be tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be."
41,13,20,"And if the Lord had not shortened those days, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the days."
41,13,21,"Then if anyone says to you, Look, here is the Christ! or, Look, he is there! do not believe it."
41,13,22,"For false christs and false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect."
41,13,23,"But take heed; see, I have told you all things beforehand."
41,13,24,"»But in those days, after that tribulation,"
41,13,25,""
41,13,26,"Then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory."
41,13,27,"And then he will send out his angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven."
41,13,28,"»Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near."
41,13,29,"So also, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door."
41,13,30,"Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away before all these things take place."
41,13,31,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."
41,13,32,"»But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."
41,13,33,"Take heed, watch; for you do not know when the time will come."
41,13,34,"It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch."
41,13,35,"Watch thereforefor you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning"
41,13,36,"lest, coming suddenly, he find you sleeping."
41,13,37,"And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch!«"
41,14,1,"It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth, and kill him."
41,14,2,"But they said, »Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people.«"
41,14,3,"And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly. And she broke the flask and poured it over his head."
41,14,4,"But there were some who said to themselves indignantly, »Why was this ointment wasted?"
41,14,5,"For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.« And they criticized her sharply."
41,14,6,"But Jesus said, »Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me."
41,14,7,"For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you will, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me."
41,14,8,"She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint my body for burial."
41,14,9,"And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.«"
41,14,10,"Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him to them."
41,14,11,"And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to give him money. So he sought an opportunity to betray him."
41,14,12,"Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they killed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, »Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?«"
41,14,13,"And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, »Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him."
41,14,14,"And wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, The Teacher says, where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"
41,14,15,"He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready; make preparations for us there.«"
41,14,16,"So the disciples set out and went to the city, and found it just as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover."
41,14,17,"And when it was evening he came with the twelve."
41,14,18,"And as they were at table eating, Jesus said, »Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.«"
41,14,19,"They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, »Is it I?«"
41,14,20,"He said to them, »It is one of the twelve, one who dips bread into the dish with me."
41,14,21,"For the Son of Man goes just as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.«"
41,14,22,"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them and said, »Take; this is my body.«"
41,14,23,"Then he took the cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank from it."
41,14,24,"And he said to them, »This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many."
41,14,25,"Truly, I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.«"
41,14,26,"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."
41,14,27,"And Jesus said to them, »You will all fall away; for it is written:"
41,14,28,"But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.«"
41,14,29,"Peter said to him, »Even if all fall away, I will not.«"
41,14,30,"Jesus said to him, »Truly, I say to you that this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.«"
41,14,31,"But he spoke more vehemently, »If I have to die with you, I will not deny you!« And they all said the same."
41,14,32,"They went to a place which was called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, »Sit here, while I pray.«"
41,14,33,"And he took Peter, James and John with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled."
41,14,34,"And he said to them, »My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; stay here, and watch.«"
41,14,35,"And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him."
41,14,36,"And he said, »Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me; yet not what I will, but what you will.«"
41,14,37,"Then he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, »Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?"
41,14,38,"Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.«"
41,14,39,"And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words."
41,14,40,"And when he came again, he found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to answer him."
41,14,41,"Then he came the third time and said to them, »Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
41,14,42,"Rise, let us go; see, my betrayer is at hand.«"
41,14,43,"And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders."
41,14,44,"Now the betrayer had given them a signal, saying, »The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away under guard.«"
41,14,45,"And when he came, he went up to him at once, and said, »Rabbi!« and he kissed him."
41,14,46,"And they laid hands on him and seized him."
41,14,47,"And one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear."
41,14,48,"And Jesus said to them, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?"
41,14,49,"Every day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But the scriptures must be fulfilled.«"
41,14,50,"Then they all forsook him and fled."
41,14,51,"And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth around his body. And they seized him,"
41,14,52,"and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked."
41,14,53,"And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled."
41,14,54,"But Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire."
41,14,55,"Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none."
41,14,56,"For many bore false witness against him, but their testimonies did not agree."
41,14,57,"Then some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,"
41,14,58,"»We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another not made with hands.«"
41,14,59,"Yet even then their testimony did not agree."
41,14,60,"And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, »Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?«"
41,14,61,"But he was silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, »Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?«"
41,14,62,"And Jesus said, »I am."
41,14,63,"The high priest tore his clothes and said, »Why do we need any more witnesses?"
41,14,64,"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?« And they all condemned him as worthy of death."
41,14,65,"Then some began to spit on him, and to blindfold him, and to beat him, and to say to him, »Prophesy!« And the guards received him with slaps in the face."
41,14,66,"Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came."
41,14,67,"And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, »You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.«"
41,14,68,"But he denied it, saying, »I neither know nor understand what you mean.« And he went out into the gateway."
41,14,69,"And the servant girl saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by, »This is one of them.«"
41,14,70,"But again he denied it. And after a little while again those standing near said to Peter, »Surely you are one of them; for you are a Gallilean.«"
41,14,71,"But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, »I do not know this man of whom you speak.«"
41,14,72,"And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had said to him, »Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.« And he broke down and wept."
41,15,1,"Very early in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council; and they bound Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate."
41,15,2,"Then Pilate asked him, »Are you the King of the Jews?« And he answered him, »It is as you say.«"
41,15,3,"And the chief priests accused him of many things."
41,15,4,"And Pilate again asked him, »Have you no answer to make? See how many things they bring against you.«"
41,15,5,"But Jesus still made no answer, so that Pilate was amazed."
41,15,6,"Now at the feast he was accustomed to release for them one prisoner whom they requested."
41,15,7,"And with the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas."
41,15,8,"And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he had always done for them."
41,15,9,"But Pilate answered them, »Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«"
41,15,10,"For he knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him."
41,15,11,"But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead."
41,15,12,"And Pilate again said to them, »Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?«"
41,15,13,"And they cried out again, »Crucify him!«"
41,15,14,"And Pilate said to them, »Why, what evil has he done?« But they shouted all the more, »Crucify him!«"
41,15,15,"So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged him, to be crucified."
41,15,16,"The soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and they called together the whole battalion."
41,15,17,"And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and they twisted a crown of thorns and put it on him."
41,15,18,"And they began to salute him, »Hail, King of the Jews!«"
41,15,19,"Then they struck him on the head with a reed and spat on him; and falling on their knees, they paid homage to him."
41,15,20,"And when they had mocked him, they took the purple robe off him, and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him."
41,15,21,"Then they compelled a certain man, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to carry his cross."
41,15,22,"And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull)."
41,15,23,"Then they offered him wine mingled with myrrh, but he did not take it."
41,15,24,"And when they crucified him,"
41,15,25,"And it was the third hour, when they crucified him."
41,15,26,"And the inscription of the charge written against him read:"
41,15,27,"And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left."
41,15,28,""
41,15,29,"And those who passed by hurled insults at him, wagging their heads, and saying, »Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days,"
41,15,30,"save yourself, and come down from the cross!«"
41,15,31,"So also the chief priests mocked him among themselves with the scribes, and said, »He saved others; he cannot save himself."
41,15,32,"Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.« Those who were crucified with him also reviled him."
41,15,33,"And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour."
41,15,34,"And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, »Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?«which means, »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«"
41,15,35,"When some of those standing near heard this, they said, »Behold, he is calling Elijah.«"
41,15,36,"And one ran and filled a sponge full of wine vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to him to drink, saying, »Wait, let us see if Elijah will come to take him down.«"
41,15,37,"And with a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last."
41,15,38,"Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom."
41,15,39,"So when the centurion, who stood opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, »Truly this man was the Son of God!«"
41,15,40,"There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome,"
41,15,41,"who also followed him and ministered to him when he was in Galilee; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem."
41,15,42,"Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,"
41,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus."
41,15,44,"Pilate marveled that he was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if he was already dead."
41,15,45,"And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph."
41,15,46,"Then he bought fine linen, took him down, and wrapped him in the linen. And he laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb."
41,15,47,"Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid."
41,16,1,"Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him."
41,16,2,"And very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen."
41,16,3,"And they asked each other, »Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?«"
41,16,4,"But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, though it was very large, had been rolled away."
41,16,5,"And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were alarmed."
41,16,6,"But he said to them, »Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him."
41,16,7,"But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.«"
41,16,8,"So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had gripped them. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid."
41,16,9,"Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons."
41,16,10,"She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept."
41,16,11,"And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it."
41,16,12,"After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country."
41,16,13,"And they went and told it to the rest, but they did not believe them either."
41,16,14,"Later he appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table; and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen."
41,16,15,"And he said to them, »Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation."
41,16,16,"He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned."
41,16,17,"And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;"
41,16,18,"they will pick up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.«"
41,16,19,"So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God."
41,16,20,"Then they went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that accompanied it. Amen."
42,1,1,"Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things which have been fulfilled among us,"
42,1,2,"just as they were delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,"
42,1,3,"it seemed good to me also, having carefully investigated all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus,"
42,1,4,"so that you may know the certainty of the things which you have been taught."
42,1,5,"In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth."
42,1,6,"And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless."
42,1,7,"But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years."
42,1,8,"Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty,"
42,1,9,"according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense."
42,1,10,"And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense."
42,1,11,"Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense."
42,1,12,"And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him."
42,1,13,"But the angel said to him, »Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John."
42,1,14,"And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth."
42,1,15,"For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mothers womb."
42,1,16,"And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God."
42,1,17,"And he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.«"
42,1,18,"And Zechariah said to the angel, »How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.«"
42,1,19,"And the angel answered him, »I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news."
42,1,20,"And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things come to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.«"
42,1,21,"And the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple."
42,1,22,"But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he made signs to them and remained speechless."
42,1,23,"And when his time of service was completed, he went to his home."
42,1,24,"After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she hid herself, saying,"
42,1,25,"»Thus the Lord has done to me, in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.«"
42,1,26,"In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,"
42,1,27,"to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgins name was Mary."
42,1,28,"The angel went to her and said, »Hail, O highly favored one, the Lord is with you!«"
42,1,29,"But she was greatly troubled at his saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be."
42,1,30,"And the angel said to her, »Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God."
42,1,31,"And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus."
42,1,32,"He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David."
42,1,33,"And he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.«"
42,1,34,"And Mary said to the angel, »How can this be, since I am a virgin?«"
42,1,35,"And the angel answered her, »The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God."
42,1,36,"And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren."
42,1,37,"For with God nothing will be impossible.«"
42,1,38,"Then Mary said, »Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.« And the angel departed from her."
42,1,39,"In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah,"
42,1,40,"and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth."
42,1,41,"And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit."
42,1,42,"And she exclaimed with a loud voice, »Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!"
42,1,43,"But why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"
42,1,44,"For behold, as soon as the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy."
42,1,45,"And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.«"
42,1,46,"And Mary said:"
42,1,47,""
42,1,48,""
42,1,49,""
42,1,50,""
42,1,51,""
42,1,52,""
42,1,53,""
42,1,54,""
42,1,55,""
42,1,56,"And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home."
42,1,57,"Now the time came for Elizabeth to be delivered, and she gave birth to a son."
42,1,58,"Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her."
42,1,59,"On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they would have named him Zechariah after his father,"
42,1,60,"but his mother said, »No; he shall be called John.«"
42,1,61,"They said to her, »There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name.«"
42,1,62,"And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he would have him called."
42,1,63,"And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, »His name is John.« And they all marveled."
42,1,64,"And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, praising God."
42,1,65,"And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea;"
42,1,66,"and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, »What then will this child be?« For the hand of the Lord was with him."
42,1,67,"Now his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:"
42,1,68,""
42,1,69,""
42,1,70,""
42,1,71,""
42,1,72,""

42,1,76,""
42,1,77,""
42,1,78,""
42,1,79,""
42,1,80,"And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness till the day of his manifestation to Israel."
42,2,1,"In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of all the world."
42,2,2,"This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria."
42,2,3,"And all went to be registered, everyone to his own city."
42,2,4,"And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,"
42,2,5,"to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child."
42,2,6,"And while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered."
42,2,7,"And she gave birth to her first-born son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn."
42,2,8,"And in that region there were shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night."
42,2,9,"And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear."
42,2,10,"Then the angel said to them, »Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people."
42,2,11,"For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord."
42,2,12,"And this will be a sign to you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.«"
42,2,13,"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,"
42,2,14,""
42,2,15,"When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, »Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.«"
42,2,16,"And they went with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger."
42,2,17,"Now when they had seen him, they made widely known the saying which had been told them concerning this child."
42,2,18,"And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them."
42,2,19,"But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart."
42,2,20,"Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it had been told them."
42,2,21,"And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb."
42,2,22,"And when the time of their purification according to the law of Moses was completed, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord"
42,2,23,"(as it is written in the law of the Lord, »Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord«),"
42,2,24,"and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, »a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.«"
42,2,25,"Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him."
42,2,26,"And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ."
42,2,27,"So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,"
42,2,28,"he took him up in his arms and blessed God, and said:"
42,2,29,""
42,2,30,""
42,2,31,""
42,2,32,""
42,2,33,"And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him."
42,2,34,"Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, »Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be spoken against"
42,2,35,"(and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.«"
42,2,36,"And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity,"
42,2,37,"and as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, but worshipped with fasting and prayer night and day."
42,2,38,"And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem."
42,2,39,"And when they had performed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth."
42,2,40,"And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him."
42,2,41,"His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover."
42,2,42,"And when he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom."
42,2,43,"And when the feast was over, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,"
42,2,44,"but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and they sought him among their relatives and acquaintances."
42,2,45,"And when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him."
42,2,46,"After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions."
42,2,47,"And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers."
42,2,48,"And when they saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, »Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.«"
42,2,49,"And he said to them, »Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?«"
42,2,50,"But they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them."
42,2,51,"Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them, but his mother kept all these things in her heart."
42,2,52,"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men."
42,3,1,"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,"
42,3,2,"during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness."
42,3,3,"And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins."
42,3,4,"As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,"
42,3,5,""
42,3,6,""
42,3,7,"Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, »You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
42,3,8,"Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones."
42,3,9,"And even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.«"
42,3,10,"And the multitudes asked him, »What then shall we do?«"
42,3,11,"And he answered them, »He who has two tunics, let him share with him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.«"
42,3,12,"Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, »Teacher, what shall we do?«"
42,3,13,"And he said to them, »Collect no more than is appointed you.«"
42,3,14,"Likewise the soldiers asked him, »And what shall we do?« So he said to them, »Rob no one by violence or accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.«"
42,3,15,"As the people were in expectation, and all men questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he were the Christ,"
42,3,16,"John answered them all, »I baptize you with water; but one mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire."
42,3,17,"His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.«"
42,3,18,"And with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people."
42,3,19,"But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the other evil things Herod had done,"
42,3,20,"added this to them all, that he shut up John in prison."
42,3,21,"When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was also baptized. And as he was praying, the heaven was opened"
42,3,22,"and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, »You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.«"
42,3,23,"Now Jesus himself, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,"
42,3,24,"the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,"
42,3,25,"the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,"
42,3,26,"the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,"
42,3,27,"the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,"
42,3,28,"the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,"
42,3,29,"the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,"
42,3,30,"the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,"
42,3,31,"the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,"
42,3,32,"the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,"
42,3,33,"the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,"
42,3,34,"the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,"
42,3,35,"the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,"
42,3,36,"the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,"
42,3,37,"the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan,"
42,3,38,"the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God."
42,4,1,"Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,"
42,4,2,"being tempted for forty days by the devil. In those days he ate nothing, and when they had ended, he was hungry."
42,4,3,"And the devil said to him, »If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.«"
42,4,4,"But Jesus answered him, »It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.«"
42,4,5,"Then the devil took him up to a high place, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time."
42,4,6,"And he said to him, »To you I will give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will."
42,4,7,"If you, then, will worship me, it shall all be yours.«"
42,4,8,"And Jesus answered him, »It is written,"
42,4,9,"He took him to Jerusalem, set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here;"
42,4,10,"for it is written:"
42,4,11,"and,"
42,4,12,"And Jesus answered him, »It is said, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.«"
42,4,13,"When the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time."
42,4,14,"Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news of him went out through all the surrounding country."
42,4,15,"And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all."
42,4,16,"And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read."
42,4,17,"And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. And he opened the book, and found the place where it was written:"
42,4,18,""
42,4,19,""
42,4,20,"Then he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him."
42,4,21,"And he began to say to them, »Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.«"
42,4,22,"And all spoke well of him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth; and they said, »Is not this Joseph's son?«"
42,4,23,"He said to them, »Surely you will quote this proverb to me: Physician, heal yourself! Do here also in your own country what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.«"
42,4,24,"Then he said, »Truly, I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own country."
42,4,25,"But I tell you truly, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land;"
42,4,26,"but Elijah was sent to none of them except to Zarephath, in the region of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow."
42,4,27,"And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha; and not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.«"
42,4,28,"When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath."
42,4,29,"And they rose up and cast him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down the cliff."
42,4,30,"But passing through the midst of them, he went his way."
42,4,31,"Then he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and he was teaching them on the Sabbath."
42,4,32,"And they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority."
42,4,33,"And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice,"
42,4,34,"»Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you arethe Holy One of God!«"
42,4,35,"But Jesus rebuked him, saying, »Be quiet, and come out of him!« And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him without doing him any harm."
42,4,36,"And they were all amazed and said to one another, »What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!«"
42,4,37,"And the report about him went out into every place in the surrounding region."
42,4,38,"And he arose and left the synagogue, and entered Simon's house. Now Simons mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they made request of him on her behalf."
42,4,39,"So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she rose and served them."
42,4,40,"When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them."
42,4,41,"And demons also came out of many, crying, »You are the Son of God!« But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ."
42,4,42,"Now when it was day, he departed and went into a deserted place. And the people sought him and came to him, and tried to keep him from leaving them;"
42,4,43,"but he said to them, »I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because I was sent for this purpose.«"
42,4,44,"And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea."
42,5,1,"Now as the people pressed around him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret."
42,5,2,"And he saw two boats by the lake; but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets."
42,5,3,"Then he got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat."
42,5,4,"When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, »Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.«"
42,5,5,"And Simon answered, »Master, we toiled all night and caught nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.«"
42,5,6,"And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their nets were breaking."
42,5,7,"So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink."
42,5,8,"When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, »Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!«"
42,5,9,"For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken;"
42,5,10,"and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, »Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.«"
42,5,11,"So when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him."
42,5,12,"While he was in one of the cities, a man who was full of leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on his face and begged him, »Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.«"
42,5,13,"And he stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, »I am willing; be clean.« And immediately the leprosy left him."
42,5,14,"And he charged him to tell no one, »But go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing as a testimony to them, just as Moses commanded.«"
42,5,15,"But the report went around concerning him all the more; and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities."
42,5,16,"But he often withdrew to the wilderness and prayed."
42,5,17,"One day as he was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal."
42,5,18,"Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Jesus."
42,5,19,"When they could not find a way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus."
42,5,20,"When he saw their faith he said, »Man, your sins are forgiven you.«"
42,5,21,"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, »Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?«"
42,5,22,"But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, »Why are you reasoning in your hearts?"
42,5,23,"Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Rise up and walk?"
42,5,24,"But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins«he said to the man who was paralyzed »I say to you, rise, take up your bed and go home.«"
42,5,25,"Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and went home, glorifying God."
42,5,26,"And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, »We have seen strange things today.«"
42,5,27,"After this he went out, and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, »Follow me.«"
42,5,28,"And he left everything, rose up and followed him."
42,5,29,"Then Levi made him a great feast in his house; and there were a great number of tax collectors and others sitting at table with them."
42,5,30,"And the Pharisees and their scribes complained against his disciples, saying, »Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?«"
42,5,31,"And Jesus answered them, »Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
42,5,32,"I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.«"
42,5,33,"They said to him, »The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.«"
42,5,34,"And Jesus said to them, »Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?"
42,5,35,"But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.«"
42,5,36,"He told them a parable also: »No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one; if he does, he will tear the new garment, and the piece from the new will not match the old."
42,5,37,"And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined."
42,5,38,"But new wine must be put into new wineskins."
42,5,39,"And no one after drinking old wine desires the new; for he says, The old is better.«"
42,6,1,"One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grain fields, and his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands."
42,6,2,"But some of the Pharisees said, »Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?«"
42,6,3,"Jesus answered them, »Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:"
42,6,4,"how he entered the house of God, took and ate the consecrated bread, and also gave some to those with him, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat?«"
42,6,5,"And he said to them, »The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.«"
42,6,6,"On another Sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught, and a man was there whose right hand was withered."
42,6,7,"The scribes and the Pharisees watched him closely, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him."
42,6,8,"But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, »Rise and stand here.« And he rose and stood there."
42,6,9,"Then Jesus said to them, »I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?«"
42,6,10,"And he looked around at them all, and said to the man, »Stretch out your hand.« He did so, and his hand was restored."
42,6,11,"But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus."
42,6,12,"In those days he went out to the mountain to pray, and all night he continued in prayer to God."
42,6,13,"And when it was day, he called his disciples to himself; and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:"
42,6,14,"Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip, and Bartholomew,"
42,6,15,"Matthew, and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,"
42,6,16,"Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor."
42,6,17,"And he came down with them and stood on a level place with a crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and be healed of their diseases,"
42,6,18,"and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured."
42,6,19,"And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came from him and healed them all."
42,6,20,"He lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said:"
42,6,21,""
42,6,22,"Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude you and revile you, and cast out your name as evil, because of the Son of Man."
42,6,23,"Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets."
42,6,24,""
42,6,25,""
42,6,26,"Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for so did their fathers to the false prophets."
42,6,27,"»But I say to you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,"
42,6,28,"bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you."
42,6,29,"To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also. And from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic."
42,6,30,"Give to everyone who asks of you, and from him who takes away your goods do not ask them back."
42,6,31,"And as you wish that men would do to you, do so to them."
42,6,32,"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them."
42,6,33,"And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same."
42,6,34,"And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back, what credit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much back."
42,6,35,"But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For he is kind to the ungrateful and evil."
42,6,36,"Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful."
42,6,37,"»Judge not, and you will not be judged. Condemn not, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven."
42,6,38,"Give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.«"
42,6,39,"He also told them a parable: »Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?"
42,6,40,"A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher."
42,6,41,"And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the plank in your own eye?"
42,6,42,"Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me remove the speck that is in your eye, when you yourself do not see the plank that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the plank from out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye."
42,6,43,"»For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit."
42,6,44,"For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a bramble bush."
42,6,45,"The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good, and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks."
42,6,46,"»Why do you call me, Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?"
42,6,47,"Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like:"
42,6,48,"he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it was well built."
42,6,49,"But he who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.«"
42,7,1,"When he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum."
42,7,2,"A centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die."
42,7,3,"When he heard of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant."
42,7,4,"And when they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, »He is worthy to have you do this for him,"
42,7,5,"for he loves our nation, and has built us our synagogue.«"
42,7,6,"And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, »Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof."
42,7,7,"Therefore I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed."
42,7,8,"For I am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.«"
42,7,9,"When Jesus heard this, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd that followed him, »I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.«"
42,7,10,"And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well."
42,7,11,"Soon afterward, he went to a city called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him."
42,7,12,"As he came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her."
42,7,13,"When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, »Do not weep.«"
42,7,14,"Then he came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And he said, »Young man, I say to you, arise.«"
42,7,15,"The dead man sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother."
42,7,16,"Fear seized them all; and they glorified God, saying, »A great prophet has arisen among us;« and »God has visited his people.«"
42,7,17,"And this report about him spread throughout all Judea and all the surrounding country."
42,7,18,"Then the disciples of John told him about all these things."
42,7,19,"And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent them to the Lord, saying, »Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?«"
42,7,20,"When the men had come to him, they said, »John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?«"
42,7,21,"At that very hour he cured many of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits, and to many that were blind he gave sight."
42,7,22,"He answered them, »Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have the good news preached to them."
42,7,23,"And blessed is he who is not offended because of me.«"
42,7,24,"When the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: »What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
42,7,25,"What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts."
42,7,26,"But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet."
42,7,27,"This is he of whom it is written:"
42,7,28,"I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.«"
42,7,29,"(And when they heard him, all the people, even the tax collectors, justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John."
42,7,30,"But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)"
42,7,31,"»To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?"
42,7,32,"They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another:"
42,7,33,"For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon."
42,7,34,"The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!"
42,7,35,"But wisdom is justified by all her children.«"
42,7,36,"One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went to the Pharisee's house, and reclined at the table."
42,7,37,"And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that Jesus was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of perfume,"
42,7,38,"and as she stood behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the perfume."
42,7,39,"Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, »If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.«"
42,7,40,"And Jesus answered him, »Simon, I have something to say to you.« And he said, »Teacher, say it.«"
42,7,41,"»A certain creditor had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty."
42,7,42,"When they had nothing with which to pay him back, he freely forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?«"
42,7,43,"Simon answered, »I suppose the one to whom he forgave more.« And he said to him, »You have judged rightly.«"
42,7,44,"Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, »Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head."
42,7,45,"You gave me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss my feet from the time I came in."
42,7,46,"You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume."
42,7,47,"Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.«"
42,7,48,"And he said to her, »Your sins are forgiven.«"
42,7,49,"Then those who reclined at the table with him began to say among themselves, »Who is this who even forgives sins?«"
42,7,50,"He said to the woman, »Your faith has saved you; go in peace.«"
42,8,1,"Soon afterward, he went on through every city and village, preaching and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,"
42,8,2,"and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out,"
42,8,3,"and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their means."
42,8,4,"And when a great crowd came together and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable:"
42,8,5,"»A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it."
42,8,6,"Some fell on the rock; and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture."
42,8,7,"And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it."
42,8,8,"But others fell on good soil, sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.« When he had said this he called out, »He who has ears to hear, let him hear!«"
42,8,9,"When his disciples asked him what this parable meant,"
42,8,10,"he said, »To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to others it is given in parables, so that"
42,8,11,"»Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God."
42,8,12,"The ones along the path are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, that they may not believe and be saved."
42,8,13,"And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy; but these have no root, they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away."
42,8,14,"And the ones that fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature."
42,8,15,"But the ones that fell on the good soil are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience."
42,8,16,"»No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, that those who enter may see the light."
42,8,17,"For nothing is secret that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light."
42,8,18,"Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.«"
42,8,19,"Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd."
42,8,20,"And it was told him, »Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.«"
42,8,21,"But he said to them, »My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.«"
42,8,22,"One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, »Let us go over to the other side of the lake.« So they set out."
42,8,23,"As they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in danger."
42,8,24,"And they went and woke him, saying, »Master, Master, we are perishing!« Then he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased, and there was a calm."
42,8,25,"He said to them, »Where is your faith?« And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, »Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him?«"
42,8,26,"Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee."
42,8,27,"When he stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he lived not in a house but in the tombs."
42,8,28,"When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, »What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me!«"
42,8,29,"For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness."
42,8,30,"Jesus asked him, »What is your name?« And he said, »Legion«; because many demons had entered him."
42,8,31,"And they begged him repeatedly not to command them to go into the Abyss."
42,8,32,"Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him to let them enter them. So he gave them permission."
42,8,33,"Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned."
42,8,34,"When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country."
42,8,35,"Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid."
42,8,36,"Those who had seen it told them how he who had been demon-possessed was healed."
42,8,37,"Then all the people of the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned."
42,8,38,"The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying,"
42,8,39,"»Return to your home, and tell how much God has done for you.« And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him."
42,8,40,"Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him."
42,8,41,"And behold, there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus' feet and begged him to come to his house,"
42,8,42,"for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying."
42,8,43,"And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years and could not be healed by anyone,"
42,8,44,"came up behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of blood stopped."
42,8,45,"And Jesus said, »Who touched me?« When all denied it, Peter said, »Master, the multitudes surround you and press upon you!«"
42,8,46,"But Jesus said, »Someone touched me; for I know that power has gone out from me.«"
42,8,47,"When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed."
42,8,48,"And he said to her, »Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.«"
42,8,49,"While he was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's house and said, »Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.«"
42,8,50,"But Jesus on hearing this answered him, »Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be well.«"
42,8,51,"When he came into the house he permitted no one to go in with him except Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl."
42,8,52,"Now all were wailing and mourning for her; but he said, »Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeping.«"
42,8,53,"And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead."
42,8,54,"But he took her by the hand and called, saying, »Child, arise.«"
42,8,55,"Then her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat."
42,8,56,"And her parents were astonished, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened."
42,9,1,"Then he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases."
42,9,2,"And he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick."
42,9,3,"And he said to them, »Take nothing for the journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics."
42,9,4,"Whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart."
42,9,5,"And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town, shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.«"
42,9,6,"So they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere."
42,9,7,"Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,"
42,9,8,"by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again."
42,9,9,"And Herod said, »John I have beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?« So he sought to see him."
42,9,10,"And when the apostles returned, they told him what they had done. Then he took them with him and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida."
42,9,11,"But when the crowds learned it, they followed him; and he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing."
42,9,12,"Now the day began to wear away; and the twelve came and said to him, »Send the crowd away, to go to the surrounding villages and country, to lodge and get provisions; for we are here in a deserted place.«"
42,9,13,"But he said to them, »You give them something to eat.« And they said, »We have no more than five loaves and two fishunless we go and buy food for all these people.«"
42,9,14,"For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, »Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.«"
42,9,15,"And they did so, and made them all sit down."
42,9,16,"Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the people."
42,9,17,"They all ate and were satisfied, and they took up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over."
42,9,18,"Now it happened that as he was praying alone his disciples were with him; and he asked them, »Who do the crowds say that I am?«"
42,9,19,"So they answered, »John the Baptist; but others say Elijah; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.«"
42,9,20,"And he said to them, »But who do you say that I am?« And Peter answered, »The Christ of God.«"
42,9,21,"But he strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,"
42,9,22,"saying, »The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.«"
42,9,23,"Then he said to them all, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me."
42,9,24,"For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it."
42,9,25,"For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?"
42,9,26,"For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels."
42,9,27,"But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.«"
42,9,28,"Now about eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray."
42,9,29,"And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his robe became white and glistening."
42,9,30,"And behold, two men talked with him, Moses and Elijah,"
42,9,31,"who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem."
42,9,32,"But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him."
42,9,33,"As the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, »Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah«not knowing what he said."
42,9,34,"While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud."
42,9,35,"And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, »This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!«"
42,9,36,"When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen."
42,9,37,"On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him."
42,9,38,"And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, »Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son, for he is my only child."
42,9,39,"And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and will hardly leave him, bruising him."
42,9,40,"I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.«"
42,9,41,"Then Jesus answered, »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.«"
42,9,42,"While he was coming, the demon threw him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father."
42,9,43,"And they were all amazed at the majesty of God."
42,9,44,"»Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.«"
42,9,45,"But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying."
42,9,46,"And an argument arose among them as to which of them would be the greatest."
42,9,47,"Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a little child and set him by him,"
42,9,48,"and said to them, »Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.«"
42,9,49,"Now John answered, »Master, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.«"
42,9,50,"But Jesus said to him, »Do not forbid him, for he that is not against you is for you.«"
42,9,51,"When the time drew near for him to be received up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem."
42,9,52,"And he sent messengers on ahead, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him;"
42,9,53,"but the people did not receive him, because his face was set for Jerusalem."
42,9,54,"And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, »Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?«"
42,9,55,"But he turned and rebuked them,"
42,9,56,"and they went on to another village."
42,9,57,"As they were going along the road, a man said to him, »I will follow you wherever you go.«"
42,9,58,"And Jesus said to him, »Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.«"
42,9,59,"To another he said, »Follow me.« But he said, »Lord, let me first go and bury my father.«"
42,9,60,"Jesus said to him, »Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.«"
42,9,61,"Still another said, »I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say farewell to those at my home.«"
42,9,62,"Jesus said to him, »No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.«"
42,10,1,"After this the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go."
42,10,2,"And he said to them, »The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."
42,10,3,"Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves."
42,10,4,"Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals; and greet no one on the road."
42,10,5,"Whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house."
42,10,6,"And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you."
42,10,7,"And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they give, for the laborer deserves his wages. Do not go from house to house."
42,10,8,"Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you."
42,10,9,"Heal the sick there and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near to you."
42,10,10,"But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say,"
42,10,11,"Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near."
42,10,12,"I tell you, it will be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that town."
42,10,13,"»Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
42,10,14,"But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you."
42,10,15,"And you, Capernaum,"
42,10,16,"»He who hears you hears me, he who rejects you rejects me, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.«"
42,10,17,"The seventy returned with joy, saying, »Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.«"
42,10,18,"And he said to them, »I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven."
42,10,19,"Behold, I have given you authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you."
42,10,20,"Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.«"
42,10,21,"At that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, »I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it was your good pleasure."
42,10,22,"All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and the one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.«"
42,10,23,"Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, »Blessed are the eyes which see what you see."
42,10,24,"For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.«"
42,10,25,"And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, »Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?«"
42,10,26,"He said to him, »What is written in the law? How do you read?«"
42,10,27,"And he answered, »You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.«"
42,10,28,"And he said to him, »You have answered right; do this, and you will live.«"
42,10,29,"But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, »And who is my neighbor?«"
42,10,30,"Jesus said: »A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him of his clothing, beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead."
42,10,31,"Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side."
42,10,32,"So likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side."
42,10,33,"But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion."
42,10,34,"He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn, and took care of him."
42,10,35,"The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back."
42,10,36,"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?«"
42,10,37,"He said, »The one who showed mercy on him.« And Jesus said to him, »Go and do likewise.«"
42,10,38,"Now as they went on their way, he entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house."
42,10,39,"And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his word."
42,10,40,"But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said, »Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.«"
42,10,41,"But the Lord answered her, »Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things;"
42,10,42,"but only one thing is needed. And Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.«"
42,11,1,"He was praying in a certain place, and when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, »Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.«"
42,11,2,"He said to them, »When you pray, say:"
42,11,3,""
42,11,4,""
42,11,5,"And he said to them, »Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;"
42,11,6,"for a friend of mine has come to me on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him;"
42,11,7,"and he will answer from within, Do not bother me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything?"
42,11,8,"I tell you, though he will not get up and give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him as much as he needs."
42,11,9,"So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."
42,11,10,"For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened."
42,11,11,"What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent?"
42,11,12,"Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?"
42,11,13,"If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!«"
42,11,14,"Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. So it was, when the demon had gone out, that the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled."
42,11,15,"But some of them said, »He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons.«"
42,11,16,"Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven."
42,11,17,"But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them: »Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a house divided against itself falls."
42,11,18,"If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub."
42,11,19,"And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges."
42,11,20,"But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."
42,11,21,"When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are in peace."
42,11,22,"But when one stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils."
42,11,23,"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters."
42,11,24,"»When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, I will return to my house from which I came."
42,11,25,"And when he comes, he finds it swept and put in order."
42,11,26,"Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first.«"
42,11,27,"As he said these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, »Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts that nursed you!«"
42,11,28,"But he said, »Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!«"
42,11,29,"When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, »This is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah."
42,11,30,"For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation."
42,11,31,"The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here."
42,11,32,"The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here."
42,11,33,"»No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a secret place or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light."
42,11,34,"Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is good, your whole body also is full of light. But when it is bad, your body also is full of darkness."
42,11,35,"Therefore be careful that the light in you is not darkness."
42,11,36,"If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be completely lighted, as when the bright shining of a lamp gives you light.«"
42,11,37,"While he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him; so he went in and sat at table."
42,11,38,"The Pharisee was surprised to see that he did not first wash before dinner."
42,11,39,"But the Lord said to him, »Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness."
42,11,40,"You foolish ones! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?"
42,11,41,"But give for alms those things which are within; and behold, everything is clean for you."
42,11,42,"But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone."
42,11,43,"Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces."
42,11,44,"Woe to you! For you are like graves which are not seen, and men walk over them without knowing it.«"
42,11,45,"One of the lawyers answered him, »Teacher, by saying these things you reproach us also.«"
42,11,46,"And he said, »Woe to you also, lawyers! For you load men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers."
42,11,47,"Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them."
42,11,48,"So you witness that you approve of the deeds of your fathers; for they killed them, and you build their tombs."
42,11,49,"Therefore the wisdom of God also said, I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,"
42,11,50,"that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation,"
42,11,51,"from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it shall be required of this generation."
42,11,52,"Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.«"
42,11,53,"As he went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard, and to provoke him to speak of many things,"
42,11,54,"lying in wait for him, to catch at something he might say."
42,12,1,"In the meantime, when so many thousands of the multitude had gathered together that they trampled one another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, »Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
42,12,2,"There is nothing covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known."
42,12,3,"Therefore whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops."
42,12,4,"»I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do."
42,12,5,"But I will show you whom you should fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has power to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear him!"
42,12,6,"Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God."
42,12,7,"Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows."
42,12,8,"»I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God."
42,12,9,"But he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God."
42,12,10,"And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven."
42,12,11,"Now when they bring you before the synagogues and rulers and authorities, do not worry about how or what you should answer, or what you are to say;"
42,12,12,"for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.«"
42,12,13,"Someone in the crowd said to him, »Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.«"
42,12,14,"But he said to him, »Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?«"
42,12,15,"And he said to them, »Take heed, and beware of all covetousness; for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.«"
42,12,16,"And he told them a parable, saying: »The ground of a certain rich man yielded plentifully."
42,12,17,"And he thought to himself, What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?"
42,12,18,"And he said, I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones; and there I will store all my grain and my goods."
42,12,19,"And I will say to my soul, »Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry.«"
42,12,20,"But God said to him, Fool! This night your soul will be required of you; then whose will those things be which you have prepared?"
42,12,21,"So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.«"
42,12,22,"Then he said to his disciples, »Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; nor about your body, what you will put on."
42,12,23,"For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing."
42,12,24,"Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds!"
42,12,25,"And which of you by worrying can add a single cubit to his span of life?"
42,12,26,"If you then are not able to do this very little thing, why are you anxious about the rest?"
42,12,27,"Consider the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
42,12,28,"But if God so clothes the grass, which today is in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith!"
42,12,29,"And do not seek what you will eat or what you will drink, nor have an anxious mind."
42,12,30,"For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them."
42,12,31,"But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well."
42,12,32,"Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."
42,12,33,"Sell your possessions, and give alms; provide yourselves purses that do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys."
42,12,34,"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
42,12,35,"»Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning,"
42,12,36,"and be like men who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding feast, so that they may open to him immediately when he comes and knocks."
42,12,37,"Blessed are those servants whom the master finds watching when he comes. Truly, I say to you that he will gird himself and have them sit at table, and will come and serve them."
42,12,38,"If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those servants."
42,12,39,"But know this, that if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into."
42,12,40,"Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.«"
42,12,41,"Peter said, »Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to all?«"
42,12,42,"And the Lord said, »Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?"
42,12,43,"Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes."
42,12,44,"Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions."
42,12,45,"But if that servant says to himself, My master is delayed in coming, and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,"
42,12,46,"the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour he is not aware of, and he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers."
42,12,47,"And that servant who knew his master's will, and did not ready himself or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes."
42,12,48,"But he who did not know, and committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask the more."
42,12,49,"»I came to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!"
42,12,50,"But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!"
42,12,51,"Do you think that I came to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division."
42,12,52,"For from now on there will be five in one house divided: three against two, and two against three."
42,12,53,""
42,12,54,"He also said to the multitudes, »When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, »A shower is coming; and so it happens."
42,12,55,"And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, There will be hot weather; and there is."
42,12,56,"You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky; but how is it you do not know how to interpret this present time?"
42,12,57,"»And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?"
42,12,58,"As you go with your adversary to the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison."
42,12,59,"I tell you, you will not get out till you have paid the very last copper.«"
42,13,1,"There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices."
42,13,2,"And Jesus answered them, »Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered this way?"
42,13,3,"I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish."
42,13,4,"Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse sinners than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem?"
42,13,5,"I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.«"
42,13,6,"He told this parable: »A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none."
42,13,7,"So he said to the keeper of his vineyard, Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why should it use up the ground?"
42,13,8,"And he answered him, Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it."
42,13,9,"And if it bears fruit next year, fine; but if not, you can cut it down.«"
42,13,10,"Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath."
42,13,11,"And there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years; she was bent over and could not straighten up at all."
42,13,12,"When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, »Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.«"
42,13,13,"And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and praised God."
42,13,14,"But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, »There are six days on which work ought to be done; come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.«"
42,13,15,"Then the Lord answered him, »You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall, and lead it away to water it?"
42,13,16,"Then ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound for eighteen years, be loosed on the Sabbath day from this bond?«"
42,13,17,"When he said this, all his adversaries were put to shame; and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him."
42,13,18,"Then he said, »What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?"
42,13,19,"It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his garden; and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.«"
42,13,20,"And again he said, »To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?"
42,13,21,"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it was all leavened.«"
42,13,22,"He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem."
42,13,23,"Then one said to him, »Lord, will those who are saved be few?« And he said to them,"
42,13,24,"»Strive to enter through the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able."
42,13,25,"When once the owner of the house has risen up and shut the door, you will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open for us. He will answer you, I do not know where you come from."
42,13,26,"Then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets."
42,13,27,"But he will say, I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity!"
42,13,28,"There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out."
42,13,29,"And men will come from east and west, and from north and south, and sit at table in the kingdom of God."
42,13,30,"And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.«"
42,13,31,"At that very time some Pharisees came, and said to him, »Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you.«"
42,13,32,"And he said to them, »Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I finish my course."
42,13,33,"Nevertheless I must journey today and tomorrow, and the day following; for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem."
42,13,34,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were not willing!"
42,13,35,"Behold, your house is left to you desolate. And I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!«"
42,14,1,"One Sabbath, when he went to dine at the house of a ruler who belonged to the Pharisees, they watched him."
42,14,2,"And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy."
42,14,3,"And Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, »Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?«"
42,14,4,"But they kept silent. And he took him and healed him, and let him go."
42,14,5,"Then he said to them, »Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?«"
42,14,6,"And they could not reply to this."
42,14,7,"So he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noted how they chose the places of honor, saying to them:"
42,14,8,"»When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest one more distinguished than you be invited by him;"
42,14,9,"and he who invited you both will come and say to you, Give place to this man, and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place."
42,14,10,"But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you."
42,14,11,"For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.«"
42,14,12,"Then he also said to the one who invited him, »When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers, your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back, and you be repaid."
42,14,13,"But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,"
42,14,14,"and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.«"
42,14,15,"When one of those who sat at table with him heard this, he said to him, »Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!«"
42,14,16,"Then he said to him, »A certain man gave a great banquet and invited many."
42,14,17,"And at the time of the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, Come, for all is now ready."
42,14,18,"But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. I ask you to have me excused."
42,14,19,"And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you to have me excused."
42,14,20,"Still another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come."
42,14,21,"So the servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in the poor and the maimed, the blind and the lame."
42,14,22,"And the servant said, Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room."
42,14,23,"Then the master said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled."
42,14,24,"For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.«"
42,14,25,"Now great multitudes went with him; and he turned and said to them,"
42,14,26,"»If any one comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple."
42,14,27,"And whoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple."
42,14,28,"For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?"
42,14,29,"Otherwise, when he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him,"
42,14,30,"saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish."
42,14,31,"Or what king, going to make war against another king, will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?"
42,14,32,"And if not, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks terms of peace."
42,14,33,"So likewise, whoever of you does not give up all that he has cannot be my disciple."
42,14,34,"Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its taste, how shall it be seasoned?"
42,14,35,"It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill; men throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!«"
42,15,1,"Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him."
42,15,2,"And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, »This man receives sinners and eats with them.«"
42,15,3,"So he told them this parable:"
42,15,4,"»What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?"
42,15,5,"And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing."
42,15,6,"And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost."
42,15,7,"I tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance."
42,15,8,"»Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?"
42,15,9,"And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I had lost."
42,15,10,"In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.«"
42,15,11,"Then he said: »There was a man who had two sons."
42,15,12,"And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the share of property that falls to me. So he divided his living between them."
42,15,13,"Not many days after, the younger son gathered together all he had and took his journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in loose living."
42,15,14,"And when he had spent everything, there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in want."
42,15,15,"So he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed swine."
42,15,16,"And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him anything."
42,15,17,"But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and here I perish with hunger!"
42,15,18,"I will arise and go to my father and will say to him, »Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you."
42,15,19,"I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.«"
42,15,20,"And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion for him, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him."
42,15,21,"And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son."
42,15,22,"But the father said to his servants, Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet."
42,15,23,"And bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;"
42,15,24,"for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry."
42,15,25,"»Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing."
42,15,26,"So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant."
42,15,27,"And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound."
42,15,28,"But he was angry and refused to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him."
42,15,29,"But he answered his father, Behold, these many years I have been serving you, and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends."
42,15,30,"But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your living with harlots, you killed for him the fatted calf!"
42,15,31,"And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours."
42,15,32,"It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.«"
42,16,1,"He also said to his disciples: »There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods."
42,16,2,"So he called him and said to him, What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward."
42,16,3,"The steward said to himself, What shall I do, since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg."
42,16,4,"I have decided what to do, so that people may receive me into their houses when I am put out of the stewardship."
42,16,5,"So he called in each one of his master's debtors, and he said to the first, How much do you owe my master?"
42,16,6,"And he said, A hundred measures of oil. So he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty."
42,16,7,"Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty."
42,16,8,"So the master commended the dishonest steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light."
42,16,9,"And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings."
42,16,10,"He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he who is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much."
42,16,11,"If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will trust you with the true riches?"
42,16,12,"And if you have not been faithful in what is another's, who will give you what is your own?"
42,16,13,"No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.«"
42,16,14,"The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all this, and they scoffed at him."
42,16,15,"He said to them, »You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God."
42,16,16,"The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it."
42,16,17,"But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one dot of the law to fail."
42,16,18,"Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery."
42,16,19,"»There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and feasted sumptuously every day."
42,16,20,"And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,"
42,16,21,"longing to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores."
42,16,22,"So the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried."
42,16,23,"And in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom."
42,16,24,"And he called out, Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in this flame."
42,16,25,"But Abraham said, Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus received evil things; but now he is comforted here and you are in agony."
42,16,26,"And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us."
42,16,27,"And he said,  Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house,"
42,16,28,"for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they also come to this place of torment."
42,16,29,"Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."
42,16,30,"And he said, No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent."
42,16,31,"He said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if some one should rise from the dead.«"
42,17,1,"Then he said to his disciples, »Things that cause people to sin are bound to come, but woe to him through whom they do come!"
42,17,2,"It would be better for him if a millstone were hung round his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin."
42,17,3,"Take heed to yourselves; if your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him."
42,17,4,"And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and turns to you seven times, and says, I repent, you must forgive him.«"
42,17,5,"The apostles said to the Lord, »Increase our faith!«"
42,17,6,"So the Lord said, »If you have faith as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea, and it would obey you."
42,17,7,"»Will any one of you, who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep, say to him when he has come in from the field, Come at once and sit down to eat?"
42,17,8,"Will he not rather say to him, Prepare my supper, and gird yourself and serve me, till I eat and drink; and afterward you shall eat and drink'?"
42,17,9,"Does he thank the servant because he did what he was commanded?"
42,17,10,"So you also, when you have done all that is commanded you, say, We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.«"
42,17,11,"On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee."
42,17,12,"As he entered a village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance."
42,17,13,"And they lifted up their voices and said, »Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!«"
42,17,14,"When he saw them, he said to them, »Go, show yourselves to the priests.« And as they went, they were cleansed."
42,17,15,"Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice;"
42,17,16,"and he fell on his face at Jesus feet, giving him thanks. And he was a Samaritan."
42,17,17,"Then said Jesus, »Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?"
42,17,18,"Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?«"
42,17,19,"And he said to him, »Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.«"
42,17,20,"Now when he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, »The kingdom of God does not come with observation;"
42,17,21,"nor will they say, Look, here it is! or There! for behold, the kingdom of God is within you.«"
42,17,22,"Then he said to the disciples, »The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it."
42,17,23,"And they will say to you, Look here! or Look there! Do not go after them or follow them."
42,17,24,"For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one part to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day."
42,17,25,"But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation."
42,17,26,"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man."
42,17,27,"They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all."
42,17,28,"Likewise as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;"
42,17,29,"but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all."
42,17,30,"So will it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed."
42,17,31,"On that day, let him who is on the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away. And likewise let him who is in the field not turn back."
42,17,32,"Remember Lots wife."
42,17,33,"Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it."
42,17,34,"I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other left."
42,17,35,"Two women will be grinding together; one will be taken and the other left.«"
42,17,36,""
42,17,37,"And they said to him, »Where, Lord?« He said to them, »Where the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.«"
42,18,1,"Then he told them a parable, to show that they ought always to pray and not lose heart."
42,18,2,"He said: »In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor regarded man."
42,18,3,"And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, Grant me justice against my adversary."
42,18,4,"For a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself, Though I neither fear God nor regard man,"
42,18,5,"yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her justice, or she will wear me out by her continual coming.«"
42,18,6,"And the Lord said, »Hear what the unjust judge says."
42,18,7,"And will not God bring about justice for his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them?"
42,18,8,"I tell you that he will bring about justice for them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?«"
42,18,9,"Also he told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:"
42,18,10,"»Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector."
42,18,11,"The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you that I am not like other menextortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector."
42,18,12,"I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get."
42,18,13,"But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner!"
42,18,14,"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.«"
42,18,15,"Now they were also bringing infants to him that he might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them."
42,18,16,"But Jesus called them to him and said, »Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God."
42,18,17,"Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it.«"
42,18,18,"Now a certain ruler asked him, »Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?«"
42,18,19,"So Jesus said to him, »Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone."
42,18,20,"You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.«"
42,18,21,"And he said, »All these I have kept from my youth.«"
42,18,22,"When Jesus heard it, he said to him, »One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.«"
42,18,23,"But when he heard this, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich."
42,18,24,"Jesus looked at him and said, »How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!"
42,18,25,"For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.«"
42,18,26,"Those who heard it said, »Then who can be saved?«"
42,18,27,"But he said, »What is impossible with men is possible with God.«"
42,18,28,"Then Peter said, »Behold, we have left all and followed you.«"
42,18,29,"So he said to them, »Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,"
42,18,30,"who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.«"
42,18,31,"Then he took the twelve aside and said to them, »Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written of the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished."
42,18,32,"For he will be delivered to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon."
42,18,33,"They will scourge him and kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.«"
42,18,34,"But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about."
42,18,35,"As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging."
42,18,36,"And hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant."
42,18,37,"They told him, »Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.«"
42,18,38,"And he cried out, »Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!«"
42,18,39,"And those who led the way rebuked him, telling him to be quiet; but he cried out all the more, »Son of David, have mercy on me!«"
42,18,40,"So Jesus stopped, and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,"
42,18,41,"»What do you want me to do for you?« He said, »Lord, I want to receive my sight.«"
42,18,42,"And Jesus said to him, »Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.«"
42,18,43,"And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God."
42,19,1,"Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through."
42,19,2,"Now behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich."
42,19,3,"And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature."
42,19,4,"So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way."
42,19,5,"And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, »Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today.«"
42,19,6,"So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully."
42,19,7,"And when they saw it they all murmured, »He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.«"
42,19,8,"And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, »Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of anything, I restore it fourfold.«"
42,19,9,"And Jesus said to him, »Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham."
42,19,10,"For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.«"
42,19,11,"As they heard these things, he went on to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately."
42,19,12,"Therefore he said: »A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return."
42,19,13,"So he called ten of his servants, gave them ten minas, and said to them, Do business till I come."
42,19,14,"But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us."
42,19,15,"And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he then commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading."
42,19,16,"Then came the first, saying,  Master, your mina has earned ten minas more."
42,19,17,"And he said to him, Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very little, be in authority over ten cities."
42,19,18,"And the second came, saying, Master, your mina has earned five minas."
42,19,19,"Likewise he said to him, You also be over five cities."
42,19,20,"Then another came, saying, Master, here is your mina, which I have kept laid away in a handkerchief;"
42,19,21,"for I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow."
42,19,22,"He said to him, I will judge you out of your own mouth, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a hard man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?"
42,19,23,"Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?"
42,19,24,"And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him, and give it to him who has ten minas."
42,19,25,"And they said to him, Master, he has ten minas already!"
42,19,26,"I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away."
42,19,27,"But those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.«"
42,19,28,"When he had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem."
42,19,29,"When he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,"
42,19,30,"saying, »Go into the village opposite you, where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here."
42,19,31,"If any one asks you, Why are you untying it? you shall say to him, The Lord has need of it.«"
42,19,32,"So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them."
42,19,33,"And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, »Why are you untying the colt?«"
42,19,34,"And they said, »The Lord has need of it.«"
42,19,35,"And they brought it to Jesus, and they threw their garments on the colt and set Jesus on it."
42,19,36,"And as he went along, many spread their garments on the road."
42,19,37,"And, as he was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen,"
42,19,38,"saying,"
42,19,39,"And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, »Teacher, rebuke your disciples.«"
42,19,40,"He answered, »I tell you, if these keep silent, the stones would cry out.«"
42,19,41,"And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it,"
42,19,42,"saying, »If you had known, even you, this day, the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes."
42,19,43,"For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, and surround you and hem you in on every side,"
42,19,44,"and dash you to the ground, you and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone upon another in you; because you did not know the time of your visitation.«"
42,19,45,"Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,"
42,19,46,"saying to them, »It is written,"
42,19,47,"And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy him,"
42,19,48,"but they could not find anything they could do, for all the people hung upon his words."
42,20,1,"One day as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes, together with the elders, came up to him"
42,20,2,"and said to him, »Tell us by what authority are you doing these things? Or who it is that gave you this authority.«"
42,20,3,"He answered them, »I also will ask you a question; now tell me,"
42,20,4,"the baptism of Johnwas it from heaven or from men?«"
42,20,5,"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, »If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why did you not believe him?"
42,20,6,"But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.«"
42,20,7,"So they answered that they did not know where it was from."
42,20,8,"And Jesus said to them, »Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.«"
42,20,9,"Then he began to tell the people this parable: »A man planted a vineyard, leased it to vine-dressers, and went into another country for a long time."
42,20,10,"At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants, that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed."
42,20,11,"He sent another servant; him also they beat and treated shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed."
42,20,12,"He sent a third; and they wounded him and cast him out."
42,20,13,"Then the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him."
42,20,14,"But when the tenants saw him, they reasoned among themselves and said, This is the heir. Let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours."
42,20,15,"So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?"
42,20,16,"He will come and destroy those tenants, and give the vineyard to others.« When they heard this, they said, »May this never be!«"
42,20,17,"But he looked at them and said, »What then is this that is written:"
42,20,18,"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.«"
42,20,19,"The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the peoplefor they knew that he had spoken this parable against them."
42,20,20,"So they watched him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might catch him on what he said, in order to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor."
42,20,21,"And they asked him, »Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and you do not show partiality, but teach the way of God in truth."
42,20,22,"Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?«"
42,20,23,"But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them,"
42,20,24,"»Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?« They said, »Caesars.«"
42,20,25,"He said to them, »Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.«"
42,20,26,"And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him by what he said. But marveling at his answer they were silent."
42,20,27,"Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him,"
42,20,28,"and they questioned him, »Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother."
42,20,29,"Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children."
42,20,30,"And the second"
42,20,31,"and then the third took her, and in the same way the seven died, and they left no children."
42,20,32,"Finally the woman died also."
42,20,33,"In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.«"
42,20,34,"And Jesus said to them, »The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage."
42,20,35,"But those who are considered worthy to attain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,"
42,20,36,"nor can they die any more, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection."
42,20,37,"But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob."
42,20,38,"Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all live to him.«"
42,20,39,"And some of the scribes answered, »Teacher, you have spoken well.«"
42,20,40,"For they no longer dared to ask him any question."
42,20,41,"And he said to them, »How can they say that the Christ is the Son of David?"
42,20,42,"For David himself says in the Book of Psalms,"
42,20,43,""
42,20,44,"David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?«"
42,20,45,"And in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,"
42,20,46,"»Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,"
42,20,47,"who devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive greater condemnation.«"
42,21,1,"He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,"
42,21,2,"and he also saw a poor widow put in two copper coins."
42,21,3,"So he said, »Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of the others;"
42,21,4,"for these all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on.«"
42,21,5,"And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, he said,"
42,21,6,"»As for these things which you see, the days will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.«"
42,21,7,"So they asked him, »Teacher, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when they are about to take place?«"
42,21,8,"And he said: »Take heed that you not are deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, I am he, and, The time is near. Do not go after them."
42,21,9,"And when you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be terrified; for these things must first take place, but the end will not come immediately.«"
42,21,10,"Then he said to them, »Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom."
42,21,11,"There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven."
42,21,12,"But before all this, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. And you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake."
42,21,13,"This will turn into an opportunity for you to bear testimony."
42,21,14,"Therefore settle it in your minds not to meditate beforehand how you will answer;"
42,21,15,"for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict."
42,21,16,"You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death."
42,21,17,"You will be hated by all for my name's sake."
42,21,18,"But not a hair of your head will perish."
42,21,19,"By your endurance you will gain your lives."
42,21,20,"»But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near."
42,21,21,"Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, let those who are in the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it."
42,21,22,"For these are days of vengeance, to fulfil all that is written."
42,21,23,"Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people."
42,21,24,"They will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led captive to all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled."
42,21,25,"»There will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves,"
42,21,26,"men fainting from fear and foreboding of what is coming on the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken."
42,21,27,"Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory."
42,21,28,"Now when these things begin to take place, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.«"
42,21,29,"He told them a parable: »Look at the fig tree, and all the trees."
42,21,30,"When they are sprouting, you see and know for yourselves that summer is already near."
42,21,31,"So you also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near."
42,21,32,"Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all things take place."
42,21,33,"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."
42,21,34,"»But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that Day come on you unexpectedly like a trap."
42,21,35,"For it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth."
42,21,36,"Watch at all times, and pray always that you may have strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.«"
42,21,37,"And every day he was teaching in the temple, but at night he went out to spend the night on the mount called Olivet."
42,21,38,"And early in the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him."
42,22,1,"Now the feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the Passover."
42,22,2,"And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to kill him, for they feared the people."
42,22,3,"Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, who was numbered of the twelve."
42,22,4,"So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests and officers, how he might betray him to them."
42,22,5,"And they were glad, and agreed to give him money."
42,22,6,"So he consented, and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude."
42,22,7,"Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed."
42,22,8,"So he sent Peter and John, saying, »Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.«"
42,22,9,"They said to him, »Where do you want us to prepare it?«"
42,22,10,"He said to them, »Behold, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters."
42,22,11,"And say to the owner of the house, The Teacher says to you: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"
42,22,12,"He will show you a large, furnished upper room; there make ready.«"
42,22,13,"So they went, and found it just as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover."
42,22,14,"When the hour came, he sat at table, and the apostles with him."
42,22,15,"And he said to them, »I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;"
42,22,16,"for I tell you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.«"
42,22,17,"Then he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, »Take this and divide it among yourselves;"
42,22,18,"for I tell you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.«"
42,22,19,"And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, »This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me.«"
42,22,20,"Likewise he took the cup after supper, saying, »This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you."
42,22,21,"But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table."
42,22,22,"For the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!«"
42,22,23,"Then they began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this."
42,22,24,"A dispute also arose among them, which of them was to be considered the greatest."
42,22,25,"And he said to them, »The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors."
42,22,26,"But not so among you; on the contrary, he who is greatest among you, let him be as the youngest, and he who leads as one who serves."
42,22,27,"For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at the table? But I am among you as One who serves."
42,22,28,"You are those who have continued with me in my trials."
42,22,29,"And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as my Father bestowed one on me,"
42,22,30,"so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
42,22,31,"»Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat."
42,22,32,"But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren.«"
42,22,33,"But he said to him, »Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.«"
42,22,34,"He said, »I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day before you deny three times that you know me.«"
42,22,35,"And he said to them, »When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?« They said, »Nothing.«"
42,22,36,"He said to them, »But now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag; and let him who has no sword sell his robe and buy one."
42,22,37,"For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, And he was numbered with transgressors; for what is written about me has its fulfillment.«"
42,22,38,"They said, »Look, Lord, here are two swords.« And he said to them, »It is enough.«"
42,22,39,"He came out, and went to the Mount of Olives, as was his custom, and his disciples followed him."
42,22,40,"When he came to the place, he said to them, »Pray that you may not enter into temptation.«"
42,22,41,"And he withdrew from them about a stones throw, and knelt down and prayed,"
42,22,42,"»Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.«"
42,22,43,"An angel appeared to him from heaven, and strengthened him."
42,22,44,"And being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground."
42,22,45,"When he rose from prayer, and came to his disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow."
42,22,46,"He said to them, »Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.«"
42,22,47,"While he was still speaking, a crowd came, and the man who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him;"
42,22,48,"but Jesus said to him, »Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?«"
42,22,49,"When those around him saw what was going to happen, they said, »Lord, shall we strike with the sword?«"
42,22,50,"And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear."
42,22,51,"But Jesus answered, »No more of this!« And he touched his ear and healed him."
42,22,52,"Then Jesus said to the chief priests, officers of the temple, and the elders who had come to him, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?"
42,22,53,"When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.«"
42,22,54,"Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priests house. Peter followed at a distance."
42,22,55,"When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them."
42,22,56,"And a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight, looked at him, and said, »This man also was with him.«"
42,22,57,"But he denied it, saying, »Woman, I do not know him.«"
42,22,58,"And a little later some one else saw him and said, »You also are of them.« But Peter said, »Man, I am not!«"
42,22,59,"Then after about an hour had passed, another insisted, saying, »Certainly this fellow also was with him, for he is a Galilean.«"
42,22,60,"But Peter said, »Man, I do not know what you are saying!« Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed."
42,22,61,"And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, »Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.«"
42,22,62,"And he went out and wept bitterly."
42,22,63,"Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him."
42,22,64,"They blindfolded him and asked him, »Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?«"
42,22,65,"And they spoke many other things against him, blaspheming."
42,22,66,"As soon as it was day, the council of the elders of the people came together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to their council chamber, saying,"
42,22,67,"»If you are the Christ, tell us.« But he said to them, »If I tell you, you will not believe."
42,22,68,"And if I ask you, you will not answer."
42,22,69,"But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.«"
42,22,70,"They all said, »Are you the Son of God, then?« He said to them, »You said what I am.«"
42,22,71,"And they said, »What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.«"
42,23,1,"Then the whole body of them arose and led him to Pilate."
42,23,2,"And they began to accuse him, saying, »We found this man perverting our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.«"
42,23,3,"So Pilate asked him, »Are you the King of the Jews?« He answered him, »It is as you say.«"
42,23,4,"Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, »I find no crime in this man.«"
42,23,5,"But they were urgent, saying, »He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee to this place.«"
42,23,6,"When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean."
42,23,7,"And when he learned that he belonged to Herods jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who also was in Jerusalem at that time."
42,23,8,"Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had desired to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by him."
42,23,9,"Then he questioned him with many words, but he gave him no answer."
42,23,10,"The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him."
42,23,11,"And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then, dressing him in a gorgeous robe, he sent him back to Pilate."
42,23,12,"That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for before this they had been at enmity with each other."
42,23,13,"Pilate then called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,"
42,23,14,"and said to them, »You have brought this man to me as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. And behold, having examined him in your presence, I have found no guilt in this man concerning those charges which you make against him;"
42,23,15,"neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him;"
42,23,16,"I will therefore chastise him and release him.«"
42,23,17,""
42,23,18,"But they all cried out together, »Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas«"
42,23,19,"a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder."
42,23,20,"Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate addressed to them again."
42,23,21,"But they shouted, »Crucify him, crucify him!«"
42,23,22,"Then he said to them the third time, »Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death. I will therefore chastise him and release him.«"
42,23,23,"But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that he be crucified. And their voices prevailed."
42,23,24,"So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted."
42,23,25,"And he released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will."
42,23,26,"And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus."
42,23,27,"And a great multitude of the people followed him, and women who also mourned and lamented him."
42,23,28,"But Jesus turning to them said, »Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children."
42,23,29,"For behold, the days are coming when they will say, Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed!"
42,23,30,""
42,23,31,"For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?«"
42,23,32,"Two others, criminals, were also led with him to be put to death."
42,23,33,"And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left."
42,23,34,"Then Jesus said, »Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.« And they divided his garments and cast lots."
42,23,35,"And the people stood watching; but even the rulers sneered at him, saying, »He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.«"
42,23,36,"The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him wine vinegar,"
42,23,37,"and saying, »If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.«"
42,23,38,"There was also an inscription written over him:"
42,23,39,"One of the criminals who were hanged there hurled insults at him, saying, »Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!«"
42,23,40,"But the other rebuked him, saying, »Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?"
42,23,41,"And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.«"
42,23,42,"Then he said, »Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.«"
42,23,43,"And Jesus said to him, »Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.«"
42,23,44,"It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,"
42,23,45,"for the sun was darkened; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two."
42,23,46,"And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, »Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.« And having said this, he breathed his last."
42,23,47,"Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he praised God, and said, »Certainly this was a righteous man!«"
42,23,48,"When all the multitudes who had gathered to witness this sight saw what had taken place, they beat their breasts, and returned home."
42,23,49,"But all his acquaintances, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things."
42,23,50,"Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and righteous man,"
42,23,51,"who had not consented to their decision and deed. He came from of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and he was waiting for the kingdom of God."
42,23,52,"This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus."
42,23,53,"Then he took it down and wrapped it in linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever yet been laid."
42,23,54,"It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin."
42,23,55,"The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid."
42,23,56,"Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes."
42,23,57,""
42,24,1,"But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared."
42,24,2,"And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,"
42,24,3,"but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus."
42,24,4,"While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel."
42,24,5,"And as they were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, »Why do you seek the living among the dead?"
42,24,6,"He is not here, but is risen! Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee,"
42,24,7,"The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.«"
42,24,8,"And they remembered his words."
42,24,9,"Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest."
42,24,10,"It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who told this to the apostles."
42,24,11,"But their words seemed to them like idle tales, and they did not believe them."
42,24,12,"But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying by themselves; and he went away, marveling to himself at what had happened."
42,24,13,"Now behold, that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem."
42,24,14,"And they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened."
42,24,15,"While they talked and discussed, Jesus himself drew near and went with them."
42,24,16,"But their eyes were kept from recognizing him."
42,24,17,"And he said to them, »What is this conversation which you are exchanging with each other as you walk?« And they stood still, looking sad."
42,24,18,"Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, »Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?«"
42,24,19,"And he said to them, »What things?« And they said to him, »The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,"
42,24,20,"and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him."
42,24,21,"But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since all this happened."
42,24,22,"In addition, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning,"
42,24,23,"and when they did not find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said he was alive."
42,24,24,"Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but him they did not see.«"
42,24,25,"And he said to them, »O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!"
42,24,26,"Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and enter his glory?«"
42,24,27,"And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures."
42,24,28,"As they drew near the village to which they were going, he acted as though he would be going farther,"
42,24,29,"but they constrained him, saying, »Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.« So he went in to stay with them."
42,24,30,"When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them."
42,24,31,"Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight."
42,24,32,"And they said to each other, »Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us on the road, while he opened to us the scriptures?«"
42,24,33,"So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,"
42,24,34,"saying, »The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!«"
42,24,35,"Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread."
42,24,36,"As they were saying this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, »Peace be with you.«"
42,24,37,"But they were startled and frightened, and supposed that they saw a spirit."
42,24,38,"And he said to them, »Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your hearts?"
42,24,39,"See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.«"
42,24,40,"When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet."
42,24,41,"And while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, he said to them, »Have you anything here to eat?«"
42,24,42,"They gave him a piece of broiled fish,"
42,24,43,"and he took it and ate in their presence."
42,24,44,"Then he said to them, »These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.«"
42,24,45,"Then he opened their minds, so they could understand the Scriptures."
42,24,46,"And he said to them, »Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day,"
42,24,47,"and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."
42,24,48,"You are witnesses of these things."
42,24,49,"And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but stay in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high.«"
42,24,50,"Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them."
42,24,51,"While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven."
42,24,52,"Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,"
42,24,53,"and were continually in the temple praising God."
43,1,1,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
43,1,2,"He was with God in the beginning."
43,1,3,"All things were made through him, and without him nothing was made that was made."
43,1,4,"In him was life, and the life was the light of men."
43,1,5,"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it."
43,1,6,"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John."
43,1,7,"He came for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him."
43,1,8,"He was not the light, but came to bear witness of the light."
43,1,9,"The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world."
43,1,10,"He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world did not know him."
43,1,11,"He came to his own, and his own did not receive him."
43,1,12,"But to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God"
43,1,13,"who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God."
43,1,14,"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth."
43,1,15,"John bore witness of him and cried out, saying, »This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me ranks before me, for he was before me.«"
43,1,16,"And from his fullness have we all received, grace upon grace."
43,1,17,"For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."
43,1,18,"No one has ever seen God; God the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known."
43,1,19,"Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, »Who are you?«"
43,1,20,"He confessed, he did not deny, but confessed, »I am not the Christ.«"
43,1,21,"And they asked him, »What then? Are you Elijah?« He said, »I am not.« »Are you the prophet?« And he answered, »No.«"
43,1,22,"Then they said to him, »Who are you? Give us an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?«"
43,1,23,"He said,"
43,1,24,"Now they had been sent from the Pharisees."
43,1,25,"They asked him, »Then why do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?«"
43,1,26,"John answered them, »I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know."
43,1,27,"It is he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.«"
43,1,28,"This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing."
43,1,29,"The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, »Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"
43,1,30,"This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who ranks before me, for he was before me."
43,1,31,"I myself did not know him; but for this I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.«"
43,1,32,"And John bore witness, »I saw the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven, and it remained on him."
43,1,33,"I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit."
43,1,34,"And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.«"
43,1,35,"Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples."
43,1,36,"And he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, »Behold, the Lamb of God!«"
43,1,37,"The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus."
43,1,38,"Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, »What do you seek?« They said to him, »Rabbi« (which means Teacher), »where are you staying?«"
43,1,39,"He said to them, »Come and see.« They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour."
43,1,40,"One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother."
43,1,41,"He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, »We have found the Messiah« (which means the Christ)."
43,1,42,"He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, »You are Simon son of John. You shall be called Cephas« (which means Peter)."
43,1,43,"The next day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him, »Follow me.«"
43,1,44,"Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."
43,1,45,"Philip found Nathanael and said to him, »We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote  Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.«"
43,1,46,"And Nathanael said to him, »Can anything good come out of Nazareth?« Philip said to him, »Come and see.«"
43,1,47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and said of him, »Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!«"
43,1,48,"Nathanael said to him, »How do you know me?« Jesus answered him, »Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.«"
43,1,49,"Nathanael answered him, »Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!«"
43,1,50,"Jesus answered him, »Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.«"
43,1,51,"And he said to him, »Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.«"
43,2,1,"On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there."
43,2,2,"And Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding."
43,2,3,"When the wine was gone, the mother of Jesus said to him, »They have no wine.«"
43,2,4,"Jesus said to her, »Woman, what have you to do with me? My hour has not yet come.«"
43,2,5,"His mother said to the servants, »Do whatever he tells you.«"
43,2,6,"Now six stone jars were standing there, according to the manner for purification of the Jews, each holding twenty or thirty gallons."
43,2,7,"Jesus said to them, »Fill the jars with water.« And they filled them up to the brim."
43,2,8,"He said to them, »Now draw some out, and take it to the master of the feast.« So they took it."
43,2,9,"When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it had come from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom."
43,2,10,"And he said to him, »Every man sets out the good wine first; and when the guests have drunk freely, then the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.«"
43,2,11,"This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him."
43,2,12,"After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples; and there they stayed for a few days."
43,2,13,"The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
43,2,14,"In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers at their business."
43,2,15,"And he made a whip of cords, and drove them all, with the sheep and oxen, out of the temple; and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables."
43,2,16,"And he said to those who sold doves, »Take these things away! You shall not make my Father's house a house of merchandise!«"
43,2,17,"His disciples remembered that it was written, »Zeal for your house will consume me.«"
43,2,18,"Then the Jews said to him, »What sign do you show to us, since you do this?«"
43,2,19,"Jesus answered them, »Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.«"
43,2,20,"The Jews then said, »It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?«"
43,2,21,"But he was speaking of the temple of his body."
43,2,22,"When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken."
43,2,23,"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs which he did."
43,2,24,"But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,"
43,2,25,"and he had no need for anyone to bear witness of man, for he knew what was in man."
43,3,1,"Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews."
43,3,2,"This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, »Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.«"
43,3,3,"Jesus answered him, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.«"
43,3,4,"Nicodemus said to him, »How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?«"
43,3,5,"Jesus answered, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
43,3,6,"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
43,3,7,"Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again."
43,3,8,"The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.«"
43,3,9,"Nicodemus said to him, »How can this be?«"
43,3,10,"Jesus answered him, »Are you the teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?"
43,3,11,"Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and testify to what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony."
43,3,12,"If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?"
43,3,13,"No one has ascended into heaven, but he who came from heaven  the Son of Man."
43,3,14,"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,"
43,3,15,"that whoever believes in him may have eternal life."
43,3,16,"For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life."
43,3,17,"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved."
43,3,18,"He who believes in him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God."
43,3,19,"And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."
43,3,20,"For every one who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed."
43,3,21,"But he who does the truth comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been done in God.«"
43,3,22,"After this Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea, and there he remained with them and baptized."
43,3,23,"Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized."
43,3,24,"For John had not yet been put in prison."
43,3,25,"Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over purifying."
43,3,26,"And they came to John and said to him, »Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testifiedbehold, he is baptizing, and all are going to him.«"
43,3,27,"John answered, »A man can receive only what is given to him from heaven."
43,3,28,"You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him."
43,3,29,"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now full."
43,3,30,"He must increase, but I must decrease."
43,3,31,"»He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth, and of the earth he speaks. He who comes from heaven is above all."
43,3,32,"He testifies to what he has seen and heard; yet no one receives his testimony."
43,3,33,"He who has received his testimony has certified that God is true."
43,3,34,"For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure."
43,3,35,"The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand."
43,3,36,"He who believes in the Son has eternal life; he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.«"
43,4,1,"Now when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John"
43,4,2,"(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples),"
43,4,3,"he left Judea and departed again to Galilee."
43,4,4,"Now he had to go through Samaria."
43,4,5,"So he came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph."
43,4,6,"Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour."
43,4,7,"There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, »Give me a drink.«"
43,4,8,"For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food."
43,4,9,"Then the woman of Samaria said to him, »How is it that you, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?« For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans."
43,4,10,"Jesus answered her, »If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.«"
43,4,11,"The woman said to him, »Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?"
43,4,12,"Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his cattle?«"
43,4,13,"Jesus answered her, »Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,"
43,4,14,"but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. The water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.«"
43,4,15,"The woman said to him, »Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.«"
43,4,16,"Jesus said to her, »Go, call your husband, and come here.«"
43,4,17,"The woman answered, »I have no husband.« Jesus said to her, »You are right in saying, I have no husband;"
43,4,18,"for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.«"
43,4,19,"The woman said to him, »Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet."
43,4,20,"Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.«"
43,4,21,"Jesus said to her, »Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father."
43,4,22,"You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews."
43,4,23,"But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him."
43,4,24,"God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.«"
43,4,25,"The woman said to him, »I know that Messiah is coming« (who is called Christ). »When he comes, he will tell us all things.«"
43,4,26,"Jesus said to her, »I who speak to you am he.«"
43,4,27,"Just then his disciples came. And they marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, »What do you wish?« or, »Why are you talking with her?«"
43,4,28,"Then the woman left her water jar, and went away into the city, and said to the people,"
43,4,29,"»Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?«"
43,4,30,"They went out of the city and came to him."
43,4,31,"Meanwhile his disciples urged him, saying, »Rabbi, eat.«"
43,4,32,"But he said to them, »I have food to eat of which you do not know.«"
43,4,33,"So the disciples said to one another, »Has any one brought him food?«"
43,4,34,"Jesus said to them, »My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work."
43,4,35,"Do you not say, There are yet four months and then comes the harvest? Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields! They are already white for harvest."
43,4,36,"And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together."
43,4,37,"For here the saying is true, One sows and another reaps."
43,4,38,"I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.«"
43,4,39,"Many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony, »He told me all that I ever did.«"
43,4,40,"So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days."
43,4,41,"And many more believed because of his word."
43,4,42,"They said to the woman, »We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man is indeed the Savior of the world.«"
43,4,43,"After the two days he departed to Galilee."
43,4,44,"For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country."
43,4,45,"So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast."
43,4,46,"So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was sick."
43,4,47,"When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death."
43,4,48,"Jesus said to him, »Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.«"
43,4,49,"The official said to him, »Sir, come down before my child dies.«"
43,4,50,"Jesus said to him, »Go; your son will live.« The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way."
43,4,51,"As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was living."
43,4,52,"So he inquired of them the hour when his son got better, and they said to him, »Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.«"
43,4,53,"So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus had said to him, »Your son will live.« And he himself believed, and all his household."
43,4,54,"This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee."
43,5,1,"After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
43,5,2,"Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches."
43,5,3,"In these lay a multitude of disabled people, blind, lame, paralyzed."
43,5,4,""
43,5,5,"One man who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years."
43,5,6,"When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been in this condition for a long time, he said to him, »Do you want to be made well?«"
43,5,7,"The sick man answered him, »Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.«"
43,5,8,"Jesus said to him, »Rise, take up your bed, and walk.«"
43,5,9,"And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked."
43,5,10,"So the Jews said to the man who was cured, »It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.«"
43,5,11,"But he answered them, »The man who made me well said to me, Take up your bed, and walk.«"
43,5,12,"They asked him, »Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed, and walk?«"
43,5,13,"Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in that place."
43,5,14,"Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, »See, you are well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse may happen to you.«"
43,5,15,"The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well."
43,5,16,"For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath."
43,5,17,"But Jesus answered them, »My Father is working still, and I am working.«"
43,5,18,"Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was his Father, making himself equal with God."
43,5,19,"Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, the Son also does."
43,5,20,"For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does; and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel."
43,5,21,"For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom he will."
43,5,22,"For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,"
43,5,23,"that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him."
43,5,24,"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life."
43,5,25,"Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live."
43,5,26,"For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself,"
43,5,27,"and has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man."
43,5,28,"Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice"
43,5,29,"and come forth  those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment."
43,5,30,"»I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me."
43,5,31,"»If I bear witness of myself, my testimony is not true."
43,5,32,"There is another who bears witness of me, and I know that the testimony which he bears of me is true."
43,5,33,"You have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth."
43,5,34,"Not that the testimony which I receive is from man; but I say this that you may be saved."
43,5,35,"He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a time in his light."
43,5,36,"But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, these very works which I am doing, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me."
43,5,37,"And the Father who sent me has himself testified of me. You have never heard his voice, nor seen his form."
43,5,38,"And you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent."
43,5,39,"You search the Scriptures, because in them you think that you have eternal life; and these are they that testify of me."
43,5,40,"Yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life."
43,5,41,"»I do not receive glory from men."
43,5,42,"But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you."
43,5,43,"I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive."
43,5,44,"How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?"
43,5,45,"Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; it is Moses who accuses you, on whom you set your hope."
43,5,46,"If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me."
43,5,47,"But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?«"
43,6,1,"After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias."
43,6,2,"And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he performed on those who were diseased."
43,6,3,"Jesus went up on the mountain, and there sat down with his disciples."
43,6,4,"Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near."
43,6,5,"Then Jesus lifted up his eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward him, he said to Philip, »Where shall we buy bread, that these people may eat?«"
43,6,6,"But this he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do."
43,6,7,"Philip answered him, »Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each one of them to have a little.«"
43,6,8,"One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,"
43,6,9,"»There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?«"
43,6,10,"Jesus said, »Make the people sit down.« Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down, in number about five thousand."
43,6,11,"Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted."
43,6,12,"And when they had eaten their fill, he said to his disciples, »Gather up the fragments left over, that nothing may be lost.«"
43,6,13,"So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, left over by those who had eaten."
43,6,14,"When the people saw the sign that Jesus did, they said, »Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.«"
43,6,15,"Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself."
43,6,16,"When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,"
43,6,17,"got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them."
43,6,18,"The sea rose because a strong wind was blowing."
43,6,19,"So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid."
43,6,20,"But he said to them, »It is I; do not be afraid.«"
43,6,21,"Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going."
43,6,22,"On the next day the people who remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone."
43,6,23,"However, boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks."
43,6,24,"So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus."
43,6,25,"When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, »Rabbi, when did you come here?«"
43,6,26,"Jesus answered them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves."
43,6,27,"Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal.«"
43,6,28,"Then they said to him, »What must we do, to be doing the works of God?«"
43,6,29,"Jesus answered them, »This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.«"
43,6,30,"So they said to him, »What sign will you perform then, that we may see it and believe you? What work will you do?"
43,6,31,"Our fathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.«"
43,6,32,"Jesus then said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven."
43,6,33,"For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.«"
43,6,34,"Then they said to him, »Lord, give us this bread always.«"
43,6,35,"And Jesus said to them, »I am the bread of life. He who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst."
43,6,36,"But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe."
43,6,37,"All that the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will by no means cast out."
43,6,38,"For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me."
43,6,39,"And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day."
43,6,40,"For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.«"
43,6,41,"The Jews then began to murmur about him, because he said, »I am the bread which came down from heaven.«"
43,6,42,"They said, »Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, I have come down from heaven?«"
43,6,43,"Jesus answered them, »Do not murmur among yourselves."
43,6,44,"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day."
43,6,45,"It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me."
43,6,46,"Not that any one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father."
43,6,47,"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has everlasting life."
43,6,48,"I am the bread of life."
43,6,49,"Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died."
43,6,50,"This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die."
43,6,51,"I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.«"
43,6,52,"Then the Jews began to argue among themselves, saying, »How can this man give us his flesh to eat?«"
43,6,53,"So Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you."
43,6,54,"Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."
43,6,55,"For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed."
43,6,56,"He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him."
43,6,57,"As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on me will live because of me."
43,6,58,"This is the bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats this bread will live for ever.«"
43,6,59,"This he said in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum."
43,6,60,"Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, »This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?«"
43,6,61,"When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples complained about this, he said to them, »Does this offend you?"
43,6,62,"What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before?"
43,6,63,"It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life."
43,6,64,"But there are some of you who do not believe.« For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who would betray him."
43,6,65,"And he said, »This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.«"
43,6,66,"From this time many of his disciples went back and no longer walked with him."
43,6,67,"Then Jesus said to the twelve, »Do you also want to go away?«"
43,6,68,"Simon Peter answered him, »Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life."
43,6,69,"And we believe, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.«"
43,6,70,"Jesus answered them, »Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?«"
43,6,71,"He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for it was he who was to betray him, though one of the twelve."
43,7,1,"After this Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him."
43,7,2,"Now the Jews' feast of Tabernacles was at hand."
43,7,3,"So his brothers said to him, »Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples may see the works you are doing."
43,7,4,"For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.«"
43,7,5,"For even his brothers did not believe in him."
43,7,6,"Jesus said to them, »My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready."
43,7,7,"The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil."
43,7,8,"You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.«"
43,7,9,"Having said this, he remained in Galilee."
43,7,10,"But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but in secret."
43,7,11,"The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, »Where is he?«"
43,7,12,"And there was much complaining among the people about him. Some said, »He is a good man«; others said, »No, on the contrary, he deceives the people.«"
43,7,13,"However, no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews."
43,7,14,"Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught."
43,7,15,"And the Jews marveled, saying, »How did this man get such learning, having never studied?«"
43,7,16,"Jesus answered them, »My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me."
43,7,17,"If anyone is willing to do his will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own authority."
43,7,18,"He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of the One who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood."
43,7,19,"Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?«"
43,7,20,"The people answered, »You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill you?«"
43,7,21,"Jesus answered them, »I did one deed, and you all marvel."
43,7,22,"Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath."
43,7,23,"If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?"
43,7,24,"Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.«"
43,7,25,"Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, »Is not this the man whom they seek to kill?"
43,7,26,"Here he is, speaking publicly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that he is the Christ?"
43,7,27,"But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from.«"
43,7,28,"Then Jesus cried out, as he taught in the temple, »You know me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come on my own, but he who sent me is true, and him you do not know."
43,7,29,"But I know him, for I am from him, and he sent me.«"
43,7,30,"Then they sought to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come."
43,7,31,"And many of the people believed in him, and they said, »When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?«"
43,7,32,"The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest him."
43,7,33,"Then Jesus said to them, »I shall be with you a little while longer, and then I go to him who sent me."
43,7,34,"You will seek me, and you will not find me; where I am you cannot come.«"
43,7,35,"The Jews said to one another, »Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?"
43,7,36,"What does he mean when he said, You will seek me and you will not find me, and, Where I am you cannot come?«"
43,7,37,"On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, »If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink."
43,7,38,"He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.«"
43,7,39,"Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified."
43,7,40,"When they heard these words, some of the people said, »Surely this is the prophet.«"
43,7,41,"Others said, »This is the Christ.« But some said, »Will the Christ come from Galilee?"
43,7,42,"Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?«"
43,7,43,"So there was a division among the people because of him."
43,7,44,"Some of them wanted to seize him, but no one laid hands on him."
43,7,45,"The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, »Why did you not bring him?«"
43,7,46,"The officers answered, »No man ever spoke like this man!«"
43,7,47,"The Pharisees answered them, »Are you deceived, you also?"
43,7,48,"Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?"
43,7,49,"But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.«"
43,7,50,"Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before, and who was one of them, said to them,"
43,7,51,"»Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he is doing?«"
43,7,52,"They replied, »Are you from Galilee, too? Search and look, and you will find that no prophet is to rise out of Galilee.«"
43,7,53,"Then each went to his own house."
43,8,1,"But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives."
43,8,2,"Early in the morning he came again to the temple; all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them."
43,8,3,"Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought to him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst,"
43,8,4,"they said to him, »Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery."
43,8,5,"Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say?«"
43,8,6,"They said this to test him, that they might have something of which to accuse him. But Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger."
43,8,7,"And when they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, »Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.«"
43,8,8,"And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground."
43,8,9,"Then those who heard it went away one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last, and Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing before him."
43,8,10,"Jesus straightened up and said to her, »Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?«"
43,8,11,"She said, »No one, Lord.« And Jesus said, »Neither do I condemn you; go, and sin no more.«"
43,8,12,"Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, »I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.«"
43,8,13,"The Pharisees then said to him, »You are bearing witness of yourself; your testimony is not true.«"
43,8,14,"Jesus answered, »Even if I bear witness of myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going."
43,8,15,"You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one."
43,8,16,"And yet if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me."
43,8,17,"In your own law it is written that the testimony of two men is true."
43,8,18,"I am One who bears witness of myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness of me.«"
43,8,19,"Then they said to him, »Where is your Father?« Jesus answered, »You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father also.«"
43,8,20,"These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come."
43,8,21,"Then Jesus said to them again, »I am going away, and you will seek me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come.«"
43,8,22,"Then the Jews said, »Will he kill himself, since he says, Where I go you cannot come?«"
43,8,23,"He said to them, »You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world."
43,8,24,"Therefore I told to you that you would die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.«"
43,8,25,"They said to him, »Who are you?« Jesus said to them, »Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning."
43,8,26,"I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.«"
43,8,27,"They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father."
43,8,28,"So Jesus said, »When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak just what the Father taught me."
43,8,29,"And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.«"
43,8,30,"As he spoke these words, many believed in him."
43,8,31,"Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him, »If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples."
43,8,32,"And you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.«"
43,8,33,"They answered him, »We are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can you say, You will be made free?«"
43,8,34,"Jesus answered them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin."
43,8,35,"And a slave does not continue in the house forever, but a son continues forever."
43,8,36,"So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed."
43,8,37,"I know that you are Abraham's descendants, yet you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you."
43,8,38,"I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your Father.«"
43,8,39,"They answered him, »Abraham is our father.« Jesus said to them, »If you were Abraham's children, you would do the things Abraham did,"
43,8,40,"but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did."
43,8,41,"You do the deeds of your father.« They said to him, »We were not born of fornication; we have one Father  God.«"
43,8,42,"Jesus said to them, »If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and came forth from God; I have not come of my own accord, but he sent me."
43,8,43,"Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you are not able to hear my word."
43,8,44,"You are of your father the devil, and you want to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies."
43,8,45,"But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me."
43,8,46,"Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?"
43,8,47,"He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason you do not hear them is that you are not of God.«"
43,8,48,"The Jews answered him, »Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?«"
43,8,49,"Jesus answered, »I do not have a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me."
43,8,50,"Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge."
43,8,51,"Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word he will never see death.«"
43,8,52,"The Jews said to him, »Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death."
43,8,53,"Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you claim to be?«"
43,8,54,"Jesus answered, »If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God."
43,8,55,"But you have not known him; I know him. If I said, I do not know him, I would be a liar like you; but I do know him and keep his word."
43,8,56,"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad.«"
43,8,57,"The Jews then said to him, »You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?«"
43,8,58,"Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.«"
43,8,59,"So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple."
43,9,1,"As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth."
43,9,2,"And his disciples asked him, »Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?«"
43,9,3,"Jesus answered, »Neither this man sinned nor his parents sinned. But that the works of God might be revealed in him,"
43,9,4,"we must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. Night is coming, when no one can work."
43,9,5,"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.«"
43,9,6,"As he said this, he spat on the ground and made clay of the saliva, and anointed the man's eyes with the clay."
43,9,7,"And he said to him, »Go, wash in the pool of Siloam« (which means, Sent). So he went and washed, and came back seeing."
43,9,8,"The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar, said, »Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?«"
43,9,9,"Some said, »It is he.« Others said, »No, but he is like him.« He said, »I am the man.«"
43,9,10,"They said to him, »Then how were your eyes opened?«"
43,9,11,"He answered and said, »A man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and I received sight.«"
43,9,12,"They said to him, »Where is he?« He said, »I do not know.«"
43,9,13,"They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind."
43,9,14,"Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes."
43,9,15,"Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, »He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.«"
43,9,16,"Some of the Pharisees said, »This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.« But others said, »How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?« And there was a division among them."
43,9,17,"So they again said to the blind man, »What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?« He said, »He is a prophet.«"
43,9,18,"The Jews did not believe that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight."
43,9,19,"And they asked them, »Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?«"
43,9,20,"His parents answered, »We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;"
43,9,21,"but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.«"
43,9,22,"His parents said this because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone confessed that he was Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue."
43,9,23,"Therefore his parents said, »He is of age; ask him.«"
43,9,24,"So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, »Give God the glory; we know that this man is a sinner.«"
43,9,25,"He answered, »Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know. One thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see.«"
43,9,26,"Then they said to him, »What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?«"
43,9,27,"He answered them, »I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?«"
43,9,28,"Then they reviled him and said, »You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses."
43,9,29,"We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we do not know where he comes from.«"
43,9,30,"The man answered, »Why, this is a marvel! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes."
43,9,31,"We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, he listens to him."
43,9,32,"Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind."
43,9,33,"If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.«"
43,9,34,"They answered him, »You were born in utter sin, and are you teaching us?« And they cast him out."
43,9,35,"Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and when he found him, he said, »Do you believe in the Son of Man?«"
43,9,36,"He answered, »Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?«"
43,9,37,"Jesus said to him, »You have seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.«"
43,9,38,"Then he said, »Lord, I believe!« And he worshiped him."
43,9,39,"Jesus said, »For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.«"
43,9,40,"Then some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this, and said to him, »Are we blind also?«"
43,9,41,"Jesus said to them, »If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, We see, your sin remains."
43,10,1,"»Truly, truly, I say to you, the man who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs in by some other way, he is a thief and a robber."
43,10,2,"But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep."
43,10,3,"To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out."
43,10,4,"When he has brought out all his own, he goes on before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice."
43,10,5,"A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.«"
43,10,6,"This figure Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them."
43,10,7,"Then Jesus said to them again, »Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep."
43,10,8,"All who ever came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them."
43,10,9,"I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture."
43,10,10,"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly."
43,10,11,"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."
43,10,12,"But he who is a hireling and not the shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them."
43,10,13,"He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep."
43,10,14,"I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep, and my sheep know me"
43,10,15,"just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep."
43,10,16,"And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock and one shepherd."
43,10,17,"For this reason my Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again."
43,10,18,"No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from my Father.«"
43,10,19,"There was again a division among the Jews because of these words."
43,10,20,"Many of them said, »He has a demon, and is mad. Why listen to him?«"
43,10,21,"Others said, »These are not the sayings of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?«"
43,10,22,"Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,"
43,10,23,"and Jesus was in the temple, walking in Solomon's Porch."
43,10,24,"So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, »How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.«"
43,10,25,"Jesus answered them, »I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me;"
43,10,26,"but you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep."
43,10,27,"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me."
43,10,28,"I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one shall snatch them out of my hand."
43,10,29,"My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand."
43,10,30,"I and the Father are one.«"
43,10,31,"The Jews took up stones again to stone him."
43,10,32,"Jesus answered them, »I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?«"
43,10,33,"The Jews answered him, »For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.«"
43,10,34,"Jesus answered them, »Is it not written in your law, I said, you are gods?"
43,10,35,"If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),"
43,10,36,"do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?"
43,10,37,"If I do not do the works of my father, do not believe me;"
43,10,38,"but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.«"
43,10,39,"Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped from their hands."
43,10,40,"He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed."
43,10,41,"And many came to him and they said, »John performed no sign, but all that John said about this man was true.«"
43,10,42,"And many believed in him there."
43,11,1,"Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha."
43,11,2,"It was this Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick."
43,11,3,"So the sisters sent to him, saying, »Lord, he whom you love is sick.«"
43,11,4,"When Jesus heard it, he said, »This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.«"
43,11,5,"Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus."
43,11,6,"So, when he heard that he was sick, he stayed two more days in the place where he was."
43,11,7,"Then after this he said to the disciples, »Let us go to Judea again.«"
43,11,8,"The disciples said to him, »Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?«"
43,11,9,"Jesus answered, »Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world."
43,11,10,"But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.«"
43,11,11,"These things he said, and after that he said to them, »Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to wake him up.«"
43,11,12,"His disciples said, »Lord, if he sleeps, he will recover.«"
43,11,13,"Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep."
43,11,14,"So then Jesus told them plainly, »Lazarus is dead;"
43,11,15,"and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.«"
43,11,16,"Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, »Let us also go, that we may die with him.«"
43,11,17,"So when Jesus came, he found that he had already been in the tomb four days."
43,11,18,"Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off,"
43,11,19,"and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother."
43,11,20,"When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary sat in the house."
43,11,21,"Martha said to Jesus, »Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
43,11,22,"But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you.«"
43,11,23,"Jesus said to her, »Your brother will rise again.«"
43,11,24,"Martha said to him, »I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.«"
43,11,25,"Jesus said to her, »I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live;"
43,11,26,"and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?«"
43,11,27,"She said to him, »Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.«"
43,11,28,"And when she had said this, she went her way and called Mary her sister, saying, »The Teacher is here and is calling for you.«"
43,11,29,"When she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him."
43,11,30,"Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him."
43,11,31,"The Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there."
43,11,32,"Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, »Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.«"
43,11,33,"When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled."
43,11,34,"And he said, »Where have you laid him?« They said to him, »Lord, come and see.«"
43,11,35,"Jesus wept."
43,11,36,"Then the Jews said, »See how he loved him!«"
43,11,37,"But some of them said, »Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?«"
43,11,38,"Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it."
43,11,39,"Jesus said, »Take away the stone.« Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, »Lord, by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been dead four days.«"
43,11,40,"Jesus said to her, »Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?«"
43,11,41,"So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, »Father, I thank you that you have heard me."
43,11,42,"I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing by, that they may believe that you sent me.«"
43,11,43,"When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, »Lazarus, come out!«"
43,11,44,"The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with grave clothes, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, »Unbind him, and let him go.«"
43,11,45,"Many of the Jews therefore, who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him."
43,11,46,"But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done."
43,11,47,"Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, »What are we to do? For this man performs many signs."
43,11,48,"If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.«"
43,11,49,"But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, »You know nothing at all!"
43,11,50,"You do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.«"
43,11,51,"He did not say this on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,"
43,11,52,"and not for that nation only, but also that he would gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad."
43,11,53,"So from that day on they plotted to put him to death."
43,11,54,"Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews, but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim; and there he stayed with his disciples."
43,11,55,"Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves."
43,11,56,"They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, »What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?«"
43,11,57,"Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, so that they might arrest him."
43,12,1,"Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead."
43,12,2,"There they made him a supper; and Martha served, while Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him."
43,12,3,"Then Mary took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume."
43,12,4,"But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, said,"
43,12,5,"»Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?«"
43,12,6,"This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief; and as he had the money box, he used to take what was put into it."
43,12,7,"Jesus said, »Let her alone, she has kept this for the day of my burial."
43,12,8,"The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.«"
43,12,9,"Now a great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead."
43,12,10,"So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus also to death,"
43,12,11,"because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus."
43,12,12,"The next day a great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem."
43,12,13,"They took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying,"
43,12,14,"Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,"
43,12,15,""
43,12,16,"His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him."
43,12,17,"The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness."
43,12,18,"For this reason the people went to meet him, because they heard that he had done this sign."
43,12,19,"The Pharisees then said to one another, »You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, The world has gone after him!«"
43,12,20,"Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast."
43,12,21,"Then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, »Sir, we wish to see Jesus.«"
43,12,22,"Philip went and told Andrew; and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus."
43,12,23,"Jesus answered them, »The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified."
43,12,24,"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much fruit."
43,12,25,"He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life."
43,12,26,"If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, him my Father will honor."
43,12,27,"»Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? No, for this purpose I came to this hour."
43,12,28,"Father, glorify your name.« Then a voice came from heaven, »I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.«"
43,12,29,"The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said, »An angel has spoken to him.«"
43,12,30,"Jesus answered, »This voice has come for your sake, not for mine."
43,12,31,"Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out."
43,12,32,"And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.«"
43,12,33,"He said this to show by what death he was to die."
43,12,34,"The crowd answered him, »We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever; and how can you say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?«"
43,12,35,"Then Jesus said to them, »A little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going."
43,12,36,"While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.«"
43,12,37,"Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him;"
43,12,38,"that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke:"
43,12,39,"Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:"
43,12,40,""
43,12,41,"Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him."
43,12,42,"Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;"
43,12,43,"for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God."
43,12,44,"Then Jesus cried out and said, »He who believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me."
43,12,45,"And he who sees me sees him who sent me."
43,12,46,"I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me should not remain in darkness."
43,12,47,"If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world."
43,12,48,"He who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will condemn him on the last day."
43,12,49,"For I have not spoken on my own authority; but the Father who sent me gave me a command, what to say and what to speak."
43,12,50,"And I know that his command is eternal life. Whatever I say, therefore, I say just as the Father has told me.«"
43,13,1,"Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end."
43,13,2,"And during supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,"
43,13,3,"Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God,"
43,13,4,"rose from supper, laid aside his garments, took a towel and girded himself."
43,13,5,"After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded."
43,13,6,"Then he came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to him, »Lord, are you going to wash my feet?«"
43,13,7,"Jesus answered him, »You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.«"
43,13,8,"Peter said to him, »You shall never wash my feet.« Jesus answered him, »If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.«"
43,13,9,"Simon Peter said to him, »Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!«"
43,13,10,"Jesus said to him, »He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not every one of you.«"
43,13,11,"For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, »You are not all clean.«"
43,13,12,"When he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and returned to his place, he said to them, »Do you know what I have done to you?"
43,13,13,"You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am."
43,13,14,"If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet."
43,13,15,"For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you."
43,13,16,"Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him."
43,13,17,"If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them."
43,13,18,"I am not speaking of you all. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, he who ate my bread has lifted up his heel against me."
43,13,19,"Now I tell you before it comes, that when it does take place, you may believe that I am he."
43,13,20,"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives anyone I send receives me; and he who receives me receives him who sent me.«"
43,13,21,"When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, »Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.«"
43,13,22,"The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke."
43,13,23,"One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was leaning close to the breast of Jesus."
43,13,24,"Simon Peter motioned to him and said, »Ask who it is of whom he speaks.«"
43,13,25,"Then, leaning back on the breast of Jesus, he said to him, »Lord, who is it?«"
43,13,26,"Jesus answered, »It is he to whom I shall give this piece of bread when I have dipped it.« And having dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon."
43,13,27,"Then after the bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, »What you are going to do, do quickly.«"
43,13,28,"But no one at the table knew why he said this to him."
43,13,29,"Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, »Buy what we need for the feast«; or, that he should give something to the poor."
43,13,30,"Having received the piece of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night."
43,13,31,"When he had gone out, Jesus said, »Now is the Son of Man glorified, and in him God is glorified."
43,13,32,"If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once."
43,13,33,"Little children, I shall be with you a little while longer. You will seek me; and as I said to the Jews, Where I am going, you cannot come, so now I say to you."
43,13,34,"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another."
43,13,35,"By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.«"
43,13,36,"Simon Peter said to him, »Lord, where are you going?« Jesus answered, »Where I am going you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow afterward.«"
43,13,37,"Peter said to him, »Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.«"
43,13,38,"Jesus answered, »Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow, till you have denied me three times."
43,14,1,"»Let not your hearts be troubled; believe in God, believe also in me."
43,14,2,"In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you."
43,14,3,"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to myself, that where I am you may be also."
43,14,4,"And you know the way where I am going.«"
43,14,5,"Thomas said to him, »Lord, we do not know where you are going, and how can we know the way?«"
43,14,6,"Jesus said to him, »I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."
43,14,7,"If you had known me, you would have known my Father also; and from now on you know him and have seen him.«"
43,14,8,"Philip said to him, »Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.«"
43,14,9,"Jesus said to him, »Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father; how can you say, Show us the Father?"
43,14,10,"Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but the Father who dwells in me does his works."
43,14,11,"Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me; or else believe me for the sake of the works themselves."
43,14,12,"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I go to the Father."
43,14,13,"And whatever you ask in my name, I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
43,14,14,"If you ask anything in my name, I will do it."
43,14,15,"»If you love me, you will keep my commandments."
43,14,16,"And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, to be with you forever "
43,14,17,"the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him; but you know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you."
43,14,18,"I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you."
43,14,19,"A little while longer, and the world will see me no more, but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also."
43,14,20,"In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you."
43,14,21,"He who has my commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.«"
43,14,22,"Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, »Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?«"
43,14,23,"Jesus answered him, »If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him."
43,14,24,"He who does not love me does not keep my words; and the word which you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me."
43,14,25,"»These things I have spoken to you, while I am still with you."
43,14,26,"But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you."
43,14,27,"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid."
43,14,28,"You have heard me say to you, I am going away and coming back to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice because I said, I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I."
43,14,29,"And now I have told you before it takes place, so that when it does take place, you may believe."
43,14,30,"I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in me."
43,14,31,"But I do as the Father commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us go from here."
43,15,1,"»I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser."
43,15,2,"Every branch in me that bears no fruit he takes away; and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, so that it may bear more fruit."
43,15,3,"You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you."
43,15,4,"Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me."
43,15,5,"I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from me you can do nothing."
43,15,6,"If anyone does not abide in me, he is like a branch that is cast away and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned."
43,15,7,"If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you."
43,15,8,"By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples."
43,15,9,"As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you; abide in my love."
43,15,10,"If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love."
43,15,11,"»These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full."
43,15,12,"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you."
43,15,13,"Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends."
43,15,14,"You are my friends if you do what I command you."
43,15,15,"No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you."
43,15,16,"You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you."
43,15,17,"This I command you, that you love one another."
43,15,18,"»If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated you."
43,15,19,"If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you."
43,15,20,"Remember the word that I said to you, A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also."
43,15,21,"But all this they will do to you for my name's sake, because they do not know him who sent me."
43,15,22,"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin."
43,15,23,"He who hates me hates my Father also."
43,15,24,"If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father."
43,15,25,"But this is to fulfill the word that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause."
43,15,26,"»But when the Counselor comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will testify of me."
43,15,27,"And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning."
43,16,1,"»I have said all this to you so that you will not go astray."
43,16,2,"They will put you out of the synagogues; yes, the time is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God."
43,16,3,"And they will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me."
43,16,4,"But I have told you these things, that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you of them."
43,16,5,"But now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, Where are you going?"
43,16,6,"But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart."
43,16,7,"Nevertheless I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away. For if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you."
43,16,8,"And when he comes, he will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:"
43,16,9,"of sin, because they do not believe in me;"
43,16,10,"of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you see me no more;"
43,16,11,"of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged."
43,16,12,"»I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now."
43,16,13,"But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak; and he will tell you things to come."
43,16,14,"He will glorify me, for he will take of what is mine and declare it to you."
43,16,15,"All that the Father has is mine. Therefore I said that he will take of what is mine and declare it to you."
43,16,16,"»A little while, and you will see me no more; again a little while, and you will see me.«"
43,16,17,"Then some of his disciples said to one another, »What is this that he says to us, A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me; and, because I go to the Father?«"
43,16,18,"They said, »What does he mean by a little while? We do not know what he is saying.«"
43,16,19,"Now Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, »Are you asking yourselves about what I meant when I said, A little while, and you will not see me; and again a little while, and you will see me?"
43,16,20,"Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy."
43,16,21,"When a woman is in labor she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but as soon as she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a child has been born into the world."
43,16,22,"So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you."
43,16,23,"In that day you will ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you."
43,16,24,"Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full."
43,16,25,"»I have said this to you in figurative language; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures, but I will tell you plainly about the Father."
43,16,26,"In that day you will ask in my name. And I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you;"
43,16,27,"for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God."
43,16,28,"I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father.«"
43,16,29,"His disciples said, »See, now you are speaking plainly, and not using a figure of speech!"
43,16,30,"Now we are sure that you know all things, and have no need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came from God.«"
43,16,31,"Jesus answered them, »Do you now believe?"
43,16,32,"Indeed the hour is coming, yes, has now come, when you will be scattered, each to his own, and will leave me alone. And yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me."
43,16,33,"I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage! I have overcome the world.«"
43,17,1,"When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said: »Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you,"
43,17,2,"as you have given him authority over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to all those you have given him."
43,17,3,"And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."
43,17,4,"I have glorified you on the earth, having finished the work which you have given me to do."
43,17,5,"And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory which I had with you before the world was made."
43,17,6,"»I have manifested your name to the men whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me, and they have kept your word."
43,17,7,"Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you."
43,17,8,"For I have given them the words which you have given me, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me."
43,17,9,"I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours."
43,17,10,"And all mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them."
43,17,11,"And now I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name  the name you gave me  that they may be one, even as we are one."
43,17,12,"While I was with them, I kept them in your name  the name you gave me. I have guarded them, and none of them is lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled."
43,17,13,"But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves."
43,17,14,"I have given them your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
43,17,15,"I do not pray that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil one."
43,17,16,"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
43,17,17,"Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth."
43,17,18,"As you sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world."
43,17,19,"And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth."
43,17,20,"»I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in me through their word;"
43,17,21,"that they all may be one, as you, Father, are in me, and I in you; that they also may be in us, that the world may believe that you sent me."
43,17,22,"And the glory which you gave me I have given them, that they may be one just as we are one:"
43,17,23,"I in them, and you in me; that they may become perfectly one, and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them even as you have loved me."
43,17,24,"Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me may be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world."
43,17,25,"O righteous Father, the world has not known you, but I have known you; and these know that you sent me."
43,17,26,"I have made known to them your name, and will make it known, that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.«"
43,18,1,"When Jesus had spoken these words, he went out with his disciples over the Kidron valley, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered."
43,18,2,"Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place; for Jesus often met there with his disciples."
43,18,3,"So Judas, having received a detachment of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons."
43,18,4,"Then Jesus, knowing all that was to come upon him, went forward and said to them, »Whom do you seek?«"
43,18,5,"They answered him, »Jesus of Nazareth.« Jesus said to them, »I am he.« And Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them."
43,18,6,"When he said to them, »I am he,« they drew back and fell to the ground."
43,18,7,"Again he asked them, »Whom do you seek?« And they said, »Jesus of Nazareth.«"
43,18,8,"Jesus answered, »I told you that I am he. So, if you seek me, let these men go.«"
43,18,9,"This happened so that the words which he had spoken would be fulfilled, »Of those whom you gave me I have lost none.«"
43,18,10,"Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priests servant, and cut off his right ear. The servants name was Malchus."
43,18,11,"Jesus said to Peter, »Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?«"
43,18,12,"Then the detachment of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him."
43,18,13,"And they led him to Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year."
43,18,14,"Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people."
43,18,15,"Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. As this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest."
43,18,16,"But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the girl who kept the door, and brought Peter in."
43,18,17,"Then the girl who kept the door said to Peter, »You are not also one of this mans disciples, are you?« He said, »I am not.«"
43,18,18,"Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself."
43,18,19,"The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching."
43,18,20,"Jesus answered him, »I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and I have said nothing in secret."
43,18,21,"Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. They know what I said.«"
43,18,22,"And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, »Is that the way you answer the high priest?«"
43,18,23,"Jesus answered him, »If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?«"
43,18,24,"Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest."
43,18,25,"Now Simon Peter stood warming himself. Therefore they said to him, »You are not also one of his disciples, are you?« He denied it and said, »I am not.«"
43,18,26,"One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, »Did I not see you in the garden with him?«"
43,18,27,"Peter again denied it; and at once a rooster crowed."
43,18,28,"Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. But they did not enter the Praetorium themselves, so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover."
43,18,29,"So Pilate went out to them and said, »What accusation do you bring against this man?«"
43,18,30,"They answered him, »If he were not an evildoer, we would not have handed him over to you.«"
43,18,31,"Pilate said to them, »Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.« The Jews said to him, »It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.«"
43,18,32,"This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken would be fulfilled, showing by what death he was going to die."
43,18,33,"Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to him, »Are you the King of the Jews?«"
43,18,34,"Jesus answered, »Do you say this on your own, or did others say it to you about me?«"
43,18,35,"Pilate answered, »Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me; what have you done?«"
43,18,36,"Jesus answered, »My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now my kingship is not from here.«"
43,18,37,"Pilate said to him, »You are a king then?« Jesus answered, »You say what I ama king. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.«"
43,18,38,"Pilate said to him, »What is truth?«"
43,18,39,"But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«"
43,18,40,"Then they all cried again, »Not this man, but Barabbas!« Now Barabbas was a robber."
43,19,1,"So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him."
43,19,2,"And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they clothed him in a purple robe."
43,19,3,"They came up to him, saying, »Hail, King of the Jews!« and struck him with their hands."
43,19,4,"Pilate went out again, and said to them, »See, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I find no crime in him.«"
43,19,5,"So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, »Behold the man!«"
43,19,6,"When the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, »Crucify him, crucify him!« Pilate said to them, »You take him and crucify him, for I find no fault in him.«"
43,19,7,"The Jews answered him, »We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.«"
43,19,8,"When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid,"
43,19,9,"and he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, »Where are you from?« But Jesus gave him no answer."
43,19,10,"Pilate said to him, »You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?«"
43,19,11,"Jesus answered, »You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered me to you has the greater sin.«"
43,19,12,"From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, »If you let this man go, you are not Caesars friend. Anyone who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.«"
43,19,13,"When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place that is called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha."
43,19,14,"Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover, about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, »Behold your King!«"
43,19,15,"But they cried out, »Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!« Pilate said to them, »Shall I crucify your King?« The chief priests answered, »We have no King but Caesar.«"
43,19,16,"Then he handed him over to them to be crucified."
43,19,17,"And he, bearing his cross, went out to a place called the Place of the Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha."
43,19,18,"There they crucified him, and two others with him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center."
43,19,19,"Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. It read:"
43,19,20,"Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin."
43,19,21,"The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, »Do not write, The King of the Jews, but, This man said, I am King of the Jews.«"
43,19,22,"Pilate answered, »What I have written, I have written.«"
43,19,23,"When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments, and made four parts, one for each soldier, and also his tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven in one piece from top to bottom."
43,19,24,"So they said to one another, »Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be.« This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says:"
43,19,25,"By the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene."
43,19,26,"When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing by, he said to his mother, »Woman, behold your son!«"
43,19,27,"Then he said to the disciple, »Behold, your mother!« And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home."
43,19,28,"After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, »I thirst.«"
43,19,29,"Now a vessel full of wine vinegar was sitting there; so they filled a sponge with the vinegar, put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth."
43,19,30,"So when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, »It is finished!« And he bowed his head and gave up his spirit."
43,19,31,"Therefore, because it was the day of Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away."
43,19,32,"Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him."
43,19,33,"But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs."
43,19,34,"But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out."
43,19,35,"He who saw it has testified, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth, that you also may believe."
43,19,36,"For these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled, »Not one of his bones shall be broken.«"
43,19,37,"And again another scripture says, »They shall look on him whom they have pierced.«"
43,19,38,"After this Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body."
43,19,39,"And Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds."
43,19,40,"So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews."
43,19,41,"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid."
43,19,42,"So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, as the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there."
43,20,1,"On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb."
43,20,2,"So she ran, and came to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, »They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.«"
43,20,3,"Peter therefore went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb."
43,20,4,"They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first."
43,20,5,"And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in."
43,20,6,"Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw the linen cloths lying there,"
43,20,7,"and the napkin that had been around his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a place by itself."
43,20,8,"Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in; and he saw and believed."
43,20,9,"For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead."
43,20,10,"Then the disciples went back to their homes."
43,20,11,"But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb."
43,20,12,"And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at the feet."
43,20,13,"They said to her, »Woman, why are you weeping?« She said to them, »Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.«"
43,20,14,"Saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus."
43,20,15,"Jesus said to her, »Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?« Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, »Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.«"
43,20,16,"Jesus said to her, »Mary!« She turned and said to him in Hebrew, »Rabboni!« (which means, Teacher)."
43,20,17,"Jesus said to her, »Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, »I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.«"
43,20,18,"Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples, »I have seen the Lord!« And she told them that he had said these things to her."
43,20,19,"On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, »Peace be with you.«"
43,20,20,"When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord."
43,20,21,"Jesus said to them again, »Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I also send you.«"
43,20,22,"And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, »Receive the Holy Spirit."
43,20,23,"If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.«"
43,20,24,"Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came."
43,20,25,"So the other disciples told him, »We have seen the Lord.« But he said to them, »Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger in the mark of the nails, and put my hand in his side, I will not believe.«"
43,20,26,"Eight days later, his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood among them, and said, »Peace be with you!«"
43,20,27,"Then he said to Thomas, »Put your finger here, and see my hands. Reach out your hand, and put it into my side; do not be unbelieving, but believing.«"
43,20,28,"Thomas answered him, »My Lord and my God!«"
43,20,29,"Jesus said to him, »Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.«"
43,20,30,"Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;"
43,20,31,"but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name."
43,21,1,"After this Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and in this way he showed himself:"
43,21,2,"Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together."
43,21,3,"Simon Peter said to them, »I am going fishing.« They said to him, »We will go with you.« They went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught nothing."
43,21,4,"But early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus."
43,21,5,"Jesus said to them, »Children, have you any fish?« They answered him, »No.«"
43,21,6,"He said to them, »Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.« So they cast, and now they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish."
43,21,7,"Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, »It is the Lord!« Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it), and threw himself into the sea."
43,21,8,"But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, but about a hundred yards off."
43,21,9,"When they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish lying on it, and bread."
43,21,10,"Jesus said to them, »Bring some of the fish you have just caught.«"
43,21,11,"Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn."
43,21,12,"Jesus said to them, »Come and have breakfast.« Now none of the disciples dared ask him, »Who are you?« They knew it was the Lord."
43,21,13,"Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish."
43,21,14,"This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead."
43,21,15,"When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, »Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?« He said to him, »Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.« He said to him, »Feed my lambs.«"
43,21,16,"He said to him again a second time, »Simon, son of John, do you love me?« He said to him, »Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.« He said to him, »Tend my sheep.«"
43,21,17,"He said to him the third time, »Simon, son of John, do you love me?« Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, »Do you love me?« And he said to him, »Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.« Jesus said to him, »Feed my sheep."
43,21,18,"Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.«"
43,21,19,"This he said to show by what death he would glorify God. And after this he said to him, »Follow me.«"
43,21,20,"Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved, who had leaned on his breast at the supper and had said, »Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?«"
43,21,21,"When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, »Lord, what about this man?«"
43,21,22,"Jesus said to him, »If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.«"
43,21,23,"Then the saying spread among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, »If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?«"
43,21,24,"This is the disciple who testifies to these things, and who wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true."
43,21,25,"But there are also many other things which Jesus did. If every one of them were to be written, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written."
44,1,1,"In the first book, O Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach,"
44,1,2,"until the day when he was taken up to heaven, after he had given orders through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen."
44,1,3,"To these he also presented himself alive after his suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God."
44,1,4,"And while staying with them, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, »Which,« he said, »you heard of from me;"
44,1,5,"for John baptized with water, but before many days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.«"
44,1,6,"So when they had come together, they asked him, »Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?«"
44,1,7,"He said to them, »It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority."
44,1,8,"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the ends of the earth.«"
44,1,9,"And after he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight."
44,1,10,"And as they were gazing intently into the sky while he was going, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them."
44,1,11,"They also said, »Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched him go into heaven.«"
44,1,12,"Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away."
44,1,13,"And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying; Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James."
44,1,14,"All these with one mind devoted themselves to prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers."
44,1,15,"In those days Peter stood up among the brethren (the company of persons was in all about a hundred and twenty), and said,"
44,1,16,"»Brethren, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David, concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus."
44,1,17,"For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry.«"
44,1,18,"(Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out."
44,1,19,"And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)"
44,1,20,"For it is written in the book of Psalms,"
44,1,21,"Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,"
44,1,22,"beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from usone of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.«"
44,1,23,"So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and Matthias."
44,1,24,"And they prayed and said, »You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen"
44,1,25,"to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside, to go to his own place.«"
44,1,26,"And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles."
44,2,1,"When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place."
44,2,2,"And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting."
44,2,3,"And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them."
44,2,4,"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance."
44,2,5,"Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven."
44,2,6,"And at this sound the crowd came together, and they were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language."
44,2,7,"They were amazed and wondered, saying, »Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?"
44,2,8,"And how is it that we hear them, each of us in his own native language?"
44,2,9,"Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,"
44,2,10,"Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,"
44,2,11,"Cretans and Arabswe hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God.«"
44,2,12,"And they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, »What does this mean?«"
44,2,13,"But others were mocking and said, »They are full of sweet wine.«"
44,2,14,"But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them: »Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words."
44,2,15,"For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day;"
44,2,16,"but this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:"
44,2,17,""
44,2,18,""
44,2,19,""
44,2,20,""
44,2,21,""
44,2,22,"»Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know"
44,2,23,"this man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put him to death."
44,2,24,"But God raised him up, having loosed the agony of death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power."
44,2,25,"For David says concerning him,"
44,2,26,""
44,2,27,""
44,2,28,""
44,2,29,"»Brethren, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day."
44,2,30,"And so, because he was a prophet, and knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,"
44,2,31,"he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ,"
44,2,32,"This Jesus God raised up again, and of that we are all witnesses."
44,2,33,"Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear."
44,2,34,"For David did not ascend into heaven, but he says himself:"
44,2,35,""
44,2,36,"Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.«"
44,2,37,"Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, »Brethren, what shall we do?«"
44,2,38,"And Peter said to them, »Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
44,2,39,"For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, for all whom the Lord our God will call to himself.«"
44,2,40,"And he testified with many other words and exhorted them, saying, »Save yourselves from this perverse generation.«"
44,2,41,"So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls."
44,2,42,"They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer."
44,2,43,"Everyone was filled with awe; and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles."
44,2,44,"And all who believed were together and had all things in common;"
44,2,45,"and they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, as anyone had need."
44,2,46,"And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they ate together with glad and sincere hearts,"
44,2,47,"praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved."
44,3,1,"Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour."
44,3,2,"And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to beg alms of those who entered the temple."
44,3,3,"When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms."
44,3,4,"And Peter, along with John, directed his gaze at him, and said, »Look at us.«"
44,3,5,"And he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them."
44,3,6,"But Peter said, »I do not have silver and gold, but I give you what I have; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.«"
44,3,7,"And taking him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong."
44,3,8,"With a leap he stood upright and began to walk; and he entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God."
44,3,9,"And all the people saw him walking and praising God,"
44,3,10,"and they recognized him as the one who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the temple to beg alms, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him."
44,3,11,"While he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch called Solomon's, astounded."
44,3,12,"And when Peter saw this he addressed the people, »Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made him walk?"
44,3,13,"The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, the one whom you delivered and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him."
44,3,14,"But you disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,"
44,3,15,"but killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses."
44,3,16,"And his name, by faith in his name, has made this man strong whom you see and know; and the faith which comes through Jesus has given him perfect health in the presence of you all."
44,3,17,"And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers."
44,3,18,"But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled."
44,3,19,"Repent therefore, and turn again, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,"
44,3,20,"and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus,"
44,3,21,"whom heaven must receive until the time for establishing all that God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from long ago."
44,3,22,"Moses said, The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brethren; you shall listen to everything he tells you."
44,3,23,"And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed from among the people."
44,3,24,"And likewise, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came afterwards, also announced these days."
44,3,25,"You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
44,3,26,"For you first, God raised up his servant and sent him to bless you by turning every one of you from your wicked ways.«"
44,4,1,"And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to them,"
44,4,2,"being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead."
44,4,3,"And they seized them and put them in jail until the next day, for it was already evening."
44,4,4,"But many of those who heard the message believed; and the number of the men came to about five thousand."
44,4,5,"On the next day, their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;"
44,4,6,"and Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family."
44,4,7,"And when they had set them in the midst, they began to inquire, »By what power or by what name did you do this?«"
44,4,8,"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, »Rulers of the people and elders,"
44,4,9,"if we are being examined today for a good deed done to a cripple, as to how this man has been healed,"
44,4,10,"be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him this man stands before you healed."
44,4,11,"He is"
44,4,12,"And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.«"
44,4,13,"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus."
44,4,14,"And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply."
44,4,15,"But when they had ordered them to leave the Council, they conferred with one another,"
44,4,16,"saying, »What shall we do with these men? For that a noteworthy miracle has been performed through them is apparent to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it."
44,4,17,"But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no longer to any one in this name.«"
44,4,18,"Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus."
44,4,19,"But Peter and John answered them, »Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge;"
44,4,20,"for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.«"
44,4,21,"And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for all the people were praising God for what had happened."
44,4,22,"For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old."
44,4,23,"When they had been released, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them."
44,4,24,"And when they heard this, they lifted their voices to God together and said, »Sovereign Lord, it is you who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything in them,"
44,4,25,"who by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David your servant, said,"
44,4,26,""
44,4,27,"For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,"
44,4,28,"to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place."
44,4,29,"And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,"
44,4,30,"while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders take place through the name of your holy servant Jesus.«"
44,4,31,"And when they had prayed, the place where they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness."
44,4,32,"Now the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common."
44,4,33,"And with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all."
44,4,34,"For there was not a needy person among them, For all who were owners of land or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of the sales"
44,4,35,"and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need."
44,4,36,"Thus Joseph who was called by the apostles Barnabas (which means, Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,"
44,4,37,"sold a field which he owned, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet."
44,5,1,"But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,"
44,5,2,"and with his wife's full knowledge he kept back some of the money for himself, and brought only a part and laid it at the apostles' feet."
44,5,3,"But Peter said, »Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land?"
44,5,4,"While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? How is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.«"
44,5,5,"When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear came upon all who heard of it."
44,5,6,"The young men arose and wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him."
44,5,7,"After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened."
44,5,8,"Peter said to her, »Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price.« And she said, »Yes, that was the price.«"
44,5,9,"Then Peter said to her, »How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.«"
44,5,10,"Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband."
44,5,11,"And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all who heard of these things."
44,5,12,"Now many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon's Porch."
44,5,13,"None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high honor."
44,5,14,"And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to their number,"
44,5,15,"so that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and pallets, so that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them."
44,5,16,"The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed."
44,5,17,"But the high priest rose up and all who were with him, that is, the party of the Sadducees, and they were filled with jealousy."
44,5,18,"They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail."
44,5,19,"But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison, and brought them out, and said,"
44,5,20,"»Go, stand and speak to the people in the temple the whole message of this Life.«"
44,5,21,"And when they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak and began to teach. Now when the high priest and his associates came, they called the Council together, even all the Senate of the sons of Israel, and sent orders to the prison house for them to be brought."
44,5,22,"But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, and they returned and reported back,"
44,5,23,"»We found the prison securely locked, and the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.«"
44,5,24,"Now when the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed about them, wondering what would come of this."
44,5,25,"And someone came and told them, »Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.«"
44,5,26,"Then the captain went along with the officers and brought them back without violence, for they were afraid of the people, that they might be stoned."
44,5,27,"When they had brought them, they set them before the council. The high priest questioned them,"
44,5,28,"saying, »We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.«"
44,5,29,"But Peter and the apostles answered, »We must obey God rather than men."
44,5,30,"The God of our fathers raised Jesuswhom you had killed by hanging him on a tree."
44,5,31,"God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior, to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel."
44,5,32,"We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.«"
44,5,33,"When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to kill them."
44,5,34,"But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, held in honor by all the people, stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a while."
44,5,35,"And he said to them, »Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men."
44,5,36,"For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men joined him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing."
44,5,37,"After this man, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him; he too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered."
44,5,38,"So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or action is of men, it will fail;"
44,5,39,"but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; or else you may even be found fighting against God.«"
44,5,40,"So they took his advice, and they called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go."
44,5,41,"Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name."
44,5,42,"And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ."
44,6,1,"Now in those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Hellenistic Jews among them complained against the native Hebrews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food."
44,6,2,"So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said, »It is not right for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables."
44,6,3,"Therefore, brethren, pick out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty."
44,6,4,"But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.«"
44,6,5,"And the statement pleased the whole congregation; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch."
44,6,6,"These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them."
44,6,7,"The word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith."
44,6,8,"And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people."
44,6,9,"Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, arose and disputed with Stephen."
44,6,10,"But they could not stand against the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke."
44,6,11,"Then they secretly induced men to say, »We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.«"
44,6,12,"They stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came on him and seized him, and brought him before the council."
44,6,13,"They put forward false witnesses who said, »This man never stops speaking against this holy place, and the law;"
44,6,14,"for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses handed down to us.«"
44,6,15,"And fixing their gaze on him, all who were sitting in the Council saw that his face was like the face of an angel."
44,7,1,"The high priest said, »Are these things so?«"
44,7,2,"And he said: »Hear me, brethren and fathers! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,"
44,7,3,"and said to him, Leave your country and your relatives, and go into the land that I will show you."
44,7,4,"Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after his father died, God had him move to this country in which you are now living."
44,7,5,"But He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground, and yet, even though he had no child, he promised that he would give it to him as a possession, and to his descendants after him."
44,7,6,"But God spoke to this effect, that his descendants would be aliens in a foreign land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years."
44,7,7,"But I will judge the nation which they serve, said God, and after that they will come out and worship me in this place."
44,7,8,"And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs."
44,7,9,"»And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt. But God was with him,"
44,7,10,"and rescued him from all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household."
44,7,11,"Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food."
44,7,12,"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there the first time."
44,7,13,"At the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family was made known to Pharaoh."
44,7,14,"Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and all his relatives to him, seventy-five persons in all."
44,7,15,"And Jacob went down to Egypt, and there he and our fathers died."
44,7,16,"They were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem."
44,7,17,"»But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt"
44,7,18,"until there arose another king over Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph."
44,7,19,"He dealt craftily with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not survive."
44,7,20,"At this time Moses was born, and was beautiful before God. And he was brought up for three months in his father's house;"
44,7,21,"and when he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her own son."
44,7,22,"Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds."
44,7,23,"»When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel."
44,7,24,"And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly, he defended him and avenged the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian."
44,7,25,"And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him, but they did not understand."
44,7,26,"On the following day he appeared to two of them as they were fighting, and tried to reconcile them, saying, Men, you are brethren; why do you wrong each other?"
44,7,27,"But the man who was wronging his neighbor pushed him aside, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?"
44,7,28,"Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?"
44,7,29,"At this remark Moses fled, and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons."
44,7,30,"»After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning bush."
44,7,31,"When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight; and as he approached to look more closely, there came the voice of the Lord:"
44,7,32,"I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look."
44,7,33,"And the Lord said to him, Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."
44,7,34,"I have certainly seen the oppression of my people in Egypt and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them. Come now, and I will send you to Egypt."
44,7,35,"This Moses whom they rejected, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? is the one God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush."
44,7,36,"This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years."
44,7,37,"This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brethren."
44,7,38,"This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living oracles to pass on to us."
44,7,39,"But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,"
44,7,40,"saying to Aaron, Make for us gods who will go before us; as for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egyptwe do not know what has happened to him."
44,7,41,"At that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands."
44,7,42,"But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets:"
44,7,43,""
44,7,44,"»Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern which he had seen."
44,7,45,"And having received it in their turn, our fathers brought it in with Joshua when they took the land from the nations whom God drove out before our fathers. So it was until the time of David,"
44,7,46,"who found favor in God's sight, and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob."
44,7,47,"But it was Solomon who built a house for him."
44,7,48,"However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands; as the prophet says:"
44,7,49,""
44,7,50,""
44,7,51,"»You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. You are doing just as your fathers did."
44,7,52,"Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered,"
44,7,53,"you who received the law as delivered by angels, and yet did not keep it.«"
44,7,54,"Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed their teeth at him."
44,7,55,"But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;"
44,7,56,"and he said, »Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.«"
44,7,57,"But they cried out with a loud voice, and covered their ears and rushed together upon him with."
44,7,58,"Then they cast him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul."
44,7,59,"And as they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, »Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.«"
44,7,60,"Then he fell on his knees and cried out with a loud voice, »Lord, do not hold this sin against them.« And when he had said this, he fell asleep."
44,8,1,"Saul was consenting to his death."
44,8,2,"Devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him."
44,8,3,"But Saul began ravaging the church, and, entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison."
44,8,4,"Now those who had been scattered went about preaching the word."
44,8,5,"Philip went down to a city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ to them."
44,8,6,"The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he did."
44,8,7,"For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed."
44,8,8,"So there was much joy in that city."
44,8,9,"Now there was a man named Simon, who had formerly practiced magic in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great,"
44,8,10,"and they all, from the least to the greatest, gave attention to him, saying, »This man is what is called the Great Power of God.«"
44,8,11,"And they gave heed to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic."
44,8,12,"But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."
44,8,13,"Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed."
44,8,14,"Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,"
44,8,15,"who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit."
44,8,16,"For he had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,8,17,"Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit."
44,8,18,"Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,"
44,8,19,"saying, »Give me also this power, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.«"
44,8,20,"But Peter said to him, »May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!"
44,8,21,"You have no part or share in this matter, for your heart is not right before God."
44,8,22,"Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you."
44,8,23,"For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.«"
44,8,24,"And Simon answered, »Pray for me to the Lord, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.«"
44,8,25,"Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans."
44,8,26,"But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, »Get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.« This is a desert road."
44,8,27,"So he got up and went. And there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship,"
44,8,28,"and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah."
44,8,29,"And the Spirit said to Philip, »Go up and join this chariot.«"
44,8,30,"So Philip ran up to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and asked, »Do you understand what you are reading?«"
44,8,31,"And he said, »How can I, unless someone guides me?« And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him."
44,8,32,"Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this:"
44,8,33,""
44,8,34,"And the eunuch said to Philip, »Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?«"
44,8,35,"Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this scripture he told him the good news of Jesus."
44,8,36,"And as they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch said, »Look, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?«"
44,8,37,""
44,8,38,"And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him."
44,8,39,"And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch saw him no more, but went on his way rejoicing."
44,8,40,"But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea."
44,9,1,"Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,"
44,9,2,"and asked for letters from him to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem."
44,9,3,"Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him."
44,9,4,"And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, »Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?«"
44,9,5,"And he said, »Who are you, Lord?« And he said, »I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,"
44,9,6,"but get up and enter the city, and it will be told you what you must do.«"
44,9,7,"The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one."
44,9,8,"Saul got up from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus."
44,9,9,"And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank."
44,9,10,"Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, »Ananias.« And he said, »Here I am, Lord.«"
44,9,11,"And the Lord said to him, »Get up and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying,"
44,9,12,"and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.«"
44,9,13,"But Ananias answered, »Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to your saints at Jerusalem;"
44,9,14,"and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.«"
44,9,15,"But the Lord said to him, »Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;"
44,9,16,"for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.«"
44,9,17,"So Ananias departed and entered the house. And after laying his hands on him said, »Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.«"
44,9,18,"And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight. And he got up and was baptized,"
44,9,19,"and he took food and was strengthened."
44,9,20,"And immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, »He is the Son of God.«"
44,9,21,"All those who heard him were amazed, and said, »Is this not he who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called on this name, and who had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?«"
44,9,22,"But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ."
44,9,23,"When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,"
44,9,24,"but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night, to kill him;"
44,9,25,"but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket."
44,9,26,"When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple."
44,9,27,"But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus."
44,9,28,"And he was with them moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord."
44,9,29,"And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews; but they were seeking to kill him."
44,9,30,"But when the brethren learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus."
44,9,31,"So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace and was built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase."
44,9,32,"Now as Peter went through all those regions, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda."
44,9,33,"There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed."
44,9,34,"Peter said to him, »Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed.« Immediately he got up."
44,9,35,"And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord."
44,9,36,"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha (which is translated Dorcas). She was full of good works and acts of charity."
44,9,37,"And at that time she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her body in an upper room."
44,9,38,"Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him, »Please come to us without delay.«"
44,9,39,"So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing the tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them."
44,9,40,"But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body, he said, »Tabitha, arise.« And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up."
44,9,41,"And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive."
44,9,42,"It became known all over Joppa, and many believed in the Lord."
44,9,43,"And Peter stayed for many days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon."
44,10,1,"At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort,"
44,10,2,"a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, and gave alms generously to the people and prayed to God continually."
44,10,3,"About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God who had just come in and said to him, »Cornelius!«"
44,10,4,"And he stared at him in terror, and said, »What is it, Lord?« And he said to him, »Your prayers and alms have ascended as a memorial before God."
44,10,5,"Now send men to Joppa, and bring a man named Simon who is called Peter;"
44,10,6,"he is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by the sea.«"
44,10,7,"When the angel who spoke to him had left, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier of those who were his personal attendants,"
44,10,8,"and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa."
44,10,9,"The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray."
44,10,10,"And he became hungry and was desiring something to eat; but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance"
44,10,11,"and he saw heaven opened, and something descending, like a great sheet, let down by four corners to the earth."
44,10,12,"In it were all kinds of four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of the air."
44,10,13,"A voice came to him, »Get up, Peter. Kill and eat!«"
44,10,14,"But Peter said, »No, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.«"
44,10,15,"And the voice came to him again a second time, »What God has cleansed, you must not call common.«"
44,10,16,"This happened three times, and immediately the thing was taken up to heaven."
44,10,17,"Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, appeared at the gate."
44,10,18,"They called out, asking whether Simon who was known as Peter was staying there."
44,10,19,"While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, »Behold, three men are looking for you."
44,10,20,"But get up, go downstairs and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them myself.«"
44,10,21,"Peter went down to the men and said, »Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason you have come?«"
44,10,22,"They said, »Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to hear what you have to say.«"
44,10,23,"So he invited them in to be his guests."
44,10,24,"On the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends."
44,10,25,"When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him."
44,10,26,"But Peter raised him up, saying, »Stand up; I too am just a man.«"
44,10,27,"As he talked with him, he went in and found many people assembled."
44,10,28,"And he said to them, »You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean."
44,10,29,"So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. I ask then why you sent for me.«"
44,10,30,"Cornelius said, »Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining garments,"
44,10,31,"and he said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God."
44,10,32,"Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter; he is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea."
44,10,33,"So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.«"
44,10,34,"And opening his mouth, Peter said: »I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality,"
44,10,35,"but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is welcome to him."
44,10,36,"You know the word which he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all)."
44,10,37,"You know what has happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached:"
44,10,38,"how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him."
44,10,39,"We are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree;"
44,10,40,"but God raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen,"
44,10,41,"not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead."
44,10,42,"And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead."
44,10,43,"Of him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.«"
44,10,44,"While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the message."
44,10,45,"All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles."
44,10,46,"For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,"
44,10,47,"»Can anyone refuse the water for these people to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?«"
44,10,48,"And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days."
44,11,1,"Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God."
44,11,2,"So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him,"
44,11,3,"saying, »You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.«"
44,11,4,"But Peter began and explained to them in order:"
44,11,5,"»I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, something descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came down to me."
44,11,6,"And when I looked into it I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air."
44,11,7,"Then I heard a voice saying to me, Get up, Peter. Kill and eat!"
44,11,8,"But I said, No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth."
44,11,9,"But the voice answered a second time from heaven, What God has cleansed you must not call common."
44,11,10,"This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven."
44,11,11,"And behold, at that moment three men appeared at the house in which we were staying, having been sent to me from Caesarea."
44,11,12,"The Spirit told me to go with them with no hesitation. These six brethren also went with me, and we entered the man's house."
44,11,13,"And he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, Send to Joppa and bring Simon, who is also called Peter;"
44,11,14,"he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household."
44,11,15,"As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning."
44,11,16,"And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit."
44,11,17,"So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could oppose God?«"
44,11,18,"When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, »So then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance unto life.«"
44,11,19,"Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews."
44,11,20,"But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus."
44,11,21,"The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord."
44,11,22,"News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch."
44,11,23,"When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts;"
44,11,24,"for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great number of people were brought to the Lord."
44,11,25,"So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul;"
44,11,26,"and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year they met with the church and taught great numbers of people; and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch."
44,11,27,"Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch."
44,11,28,"One of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine all over the world. And this took place in the reign of Claudius."
44,11,29,"And the disciples determined, each according to his ability, to send relief for the brethren living in Judea."
44,11,30,"And this they did, sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul."
44,12,1,"Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church in order to persecute them."
44,12,2,"He had James the brother of John put to death with the sword."
44,12,3,"When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread."
44,12,4,"When he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people."
44,12,5,"So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church."
44,12,6,"The very night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison."
44,12,7,"And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter's side and woke him up, saying, »Get up quickly.« And the chains fell off his hands."
44,12,8,"And the angel said to him, »Dress yourself and put on your sandals.« And he did so. And he said to him, »Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.«"
44,12,9,"So he went out and followed him; and he did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision."
44,12,10,"When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him."
44,12,11,"When Peter came to himself, he said, »Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.«"
44,12,12,"When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying."
44,12,13,"And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer."
44,12,14,"When she recognized Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate."
44,12,15,"They said to her, »You are out of your mind!« But she kept insisting that it was so. They said, »It is his angel.«"
44,12,16,"But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened the door, they saw him and were amazed."
44,12,17,"But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, »Tell this to James and to the brethren.« Then he left and went to another place."
44,12,18,"Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter."
44,12,19,"When Herod had searched for him and could not find him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there a while."
44,12,20,"Now he was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and they came to him in a body, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the kings country for food."
44,12,21,"On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and made an address to them."
44,12,22,"And the people shouted, »The voice of a god and not of a man!«"
44,12,23,"Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and died."
44,12,24,"But the word of God continued to grow and to be multiplied."
44,12,25,"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, taking along with them John, who was also called Mark."
44,13,1,"Now in the church that was at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."
44,13,2,"While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, »Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.«"
44,13,3,"Then after they had fasted and prayed, they laid their hands on them and sent them off."
44,13,4,"So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus."
44,13,5,"When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John as their helper."
44,13,6,"When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus,"
44,13,7,"who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God."
44,13,8,"But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith."
44,13,9,"But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him"
44,13,10,"and said, »You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop making crooked the straight ways of the Lord?"
44,13,11,"Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.« And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking someone to lead him by the hand."
44,13,12,"Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had happened, for he was amazed at the teaching of the Lord."
44,13,13,"Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem."
44,13,14,"But they passed on from Perga and came to Pisidian Antioch. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down."
44,13,15,"After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, »Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.«"
44,13,16,"Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said,"
44,13,17,"the God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it."
44,13,18,"For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness."
44,13,19,"When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years."
44,13,20,"After these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet."
44,13,21,"Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years."
44,13,22,"And after he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; concerning whom he testified and said, I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will."
44,13,23,"From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised."
44,13,24,"Before his coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel."
44,13,25,"And as John was completing his course, he said, What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie."
44,13,26,"»Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation."
44,13,27,"For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning him."
44,13,28,"Though they found no ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed."
44,13,29,"When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb."
44,13,30,"But God raised him from the dead;"
44,13,31,"and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people."
44,13,32,"And we preach to you the good news that what God promised to the fathers,"
44,13,33,"he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm:"
44,13,34,"As for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to decay, he spoke in this way:"
44,13,35,"Therefore he also says in another Psalm,"
44,13,36,"For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers and saw decay;"
44,13,37,"but he whom God raised did not see decay."
44,13,38,"Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,"
44,13,39,"and through him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses."
44,13,40,"Therefore take care, so that what is said in the prophets may not come upon you:"
44,13,41,""
44,13,42,"As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people begged that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath."
44,13,43,"When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God."
44,13,44,"The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord."
44,13,45,"But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted what was spoken by Paul, and blasphemed."
44,13,46,"Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, »It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first. Since you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles."
44,13,47,"For so the Lord has commanded us:"
44,13,48,"When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed."
44,13,49,"And the word of the Lord spread through the whole region."
44,13,50,"But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district."
44,13,51,"So they shook off the dust from their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium."
44,13,52,"And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit."
44,14,1,"Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue, and so spoke that a great number believed, both of Jews and of Greeks."
44,14,2,"But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren."
44,14,3,"So they spent a long time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands."
44,14,4,"But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles."
44,14,5,"When an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them,"
44,14,6,"they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and to the surrounding country;"
44,14,7,"and there they continued to preach the gospel."
44,14,8,"At Lystra there was a man sitting who had no strength in his feet, lame from birth, who had never walked."
44,14,9,"He listened to Paul speaking; and Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well,"
44,14,10,"said with a loud voice, »Stand upright on your feet.« And he leaped up and began to walk."
44,14,11,"And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language, »The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!«"
44,14,12,"Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, because he was the chief speaker, they called Hermes."
44,14,13,"The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds."
44,14,14,"But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out"
44,14,15,"»Men, why are you doing this? We also are men, of like nature with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them."
44,14,16,"In past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways;"
44,14,17,"yet he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.«"
44,14,18,"Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowds from offering sacrifice to them."
44,14,19,"But Jews came there from Antioch and Iconium; and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead."
44,14,20,"But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and entered the city. And the next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe."
44,14,21,"After they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,"
44,14,22,"strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, »Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.«"
44,14,23,"And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed."
44,14,24,"They passed through Pisidia, and came into Pamphylia."
44,14,25,"And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia."
44,14,26,"From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed."
44,14,27,"When they arrived, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles."
44,14,28,"And they spent a long time with the disciples."
44,15,1,"But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brethren, »Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.«"
44,15,2,"And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question."
44,15,3,"So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, reporting the conversion of the Gentiles, and they gave great joy to all the brethren."
44,15,4,"When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them."
44,15,5,"But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up, and said, »It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the Law of Moses.«"
44,15,6,"The apostles and the elders came together to consider this matter."
44,15,7,"After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, »Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe."
44,15,8,"And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he also did to us;"
44,15,9,"and he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith."
44,15,10,"Now therefore why do you test God by putting upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?"
44,15,11,"But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they are.«"
44,15,12,"All the assembly kept silent; and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles."
44,15,13,"After they finished speaking, James replied, »Brethren, listen to me."
44,15,14,"Simeon has related how God first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for his name."
44,15,15,"With this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written,"
44,15,16,""
44,15,17,""
44,15,18,""
44,15,19,"Therefore it is my judgment that we should not trouble those who are turning to God from among the Gentiles,"
44,15,20,"but that we should write to them to abstain from the pollutions of idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood."
44,15,21,"For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who preach him, since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath.«"
44,15,22,"Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren,"
44,15,23,"and they sent the following letter with them: »The apostles and the brethren who are elders, to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles, greetings."
44,15,24,"Since we have heard that some persons from us have disturbed you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions,"
44,15,25,"it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"
44,15,26,"men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,15,27,"We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth."
44,15,28,"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:"
44,15,29,"that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication. If you keep yourselves free from these, you will do well. Farewell.«"
44,15,30,"So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter."
44,15,31,"And when they read it, they rejoiced at its encouragement."
44,15,32,"And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged the brethren with many words and strengthened them."
44,15,33,"And after they had spent some time there, they were sent off in peace by the brethren to those who had sent them."
44,15,34,""
44,15,35,"But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also."
44,15,36,"After some days Paul said to Barnabas, »Let us return and visit the brethren in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.«"
44,15,37,"Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them."
44,15,38,"But Paul kept insisting that they should not take along one who had deserted them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work."
44,15,39,"There arose such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus."
44,15,40,"But Paul chose Silas and left, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord."
44,15,41,"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches."
44,16,1,"And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer; but his father was a Greek,"
44,16,2,"and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium."
44,16,3,"Paul wanted this man to accompany him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek."
44,16,4,"As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem."
44,16,5,"So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in numbers daily."
44,16,6,"And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia."
44,16,7,"And when they came to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;"
44,16,8,"so passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas."
44,16,9,"A vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and begging him, and saying, »Come over to Macedonia and help us.«"
44,16,10,"When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them."
44,16,11,"So putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis;"
44,16,12,"and from there to Philippi, which is the leading city of the district of Macedonia, and a Roman colony. We stayed in this city some days;"
44,16,13,"and on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had come together."
44,16,14,"A woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, who was a worshiper of God, was listening. The Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul."
44,16,15,"When she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, »If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.« And she prevailed upon us."
44,16,16,"It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave-girl who had a spirit of divination. She brought her owners much profit by fortune-telling."
44,16,17,"She followed Paul and the rest of us, crying, »These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way of salvation.«"
44,16,18,"She continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, »I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!« And it came out at that very moment."
44,16,19,"But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities,"
44,16,20,"and when they had brought them to the magistrates they said, »These men are Jews and they are throwing our city into an uproar."
44,16,21,"They advocate customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice.«"
44,16,22,"The crowd joined against them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and ordered them to be beaten with rods."
44,16,23,"And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to guard them securely."
44,16,24,"Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks."
44,16,25,"But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,"
44,16,26,"and suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened."
44,16,27,"When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped."
44,16,28,"But Paul cried with a loud voice, »Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!«"
44,16,29,"And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas."
44,16,30,"He brought them out and said, »Sirs, what must I do to be saved?«"
44,16,31,"They said, »Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.«"
44,16,32,"They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house."
44,16,33,"He took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his family."
44,16,34,"Then he brought them up into his house, and set food before them; and he rejoiced with his whole household that he had believed in God."
44,16,35,"But when it was day, the magistrates sent their police, saying, »Release those men.«"
44,16,36,"And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, »The chief magistrates have sent to release you. Therefore come out now and go in peace.«"
44,16,37,"But Paul said to them, »They have beaten us publicly, without trial, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now cast us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.«"
44,16,38,"The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens."
44,16,39,"So they came and apologized to them, and they took them out and asked them to leave the city."
44,16,40,"They went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia, and when they saw the brethren, they encouraged them and departed."
44,17,1,"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews."
44,17,2,"And Paul went in, as was his custom, and for three weeks he reasoned with them from the scriptures,"
44,17,3,"explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, »This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ.«"
44,17,4,"And some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas; as did a large number of the God-fearing Greeks and not a few of the leading women."
44,17,5,"But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked men from the market place, they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar; they attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the people."
44,17,6,"When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city authorities, shouting, »These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also,"
44,17,7,"and Jason has welcomed them, and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.«"
44,17,8,"The crowd and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard this."
44,17,9,"And when they had taken a pledge from Jason and the others, they let them go."
44,17,10,"The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue."
44,17,11,"Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so."
44,17,12,"Therefore many of them believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men."
44,17,13,"But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds."
44,17,14,"Then the brethren immediately sent Paul out to go as far as the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there."
44,17,15,"Now those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left."
44,17,16,"Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols."
44,17,17,"So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, and in the market place every day with those who happened to be there."
44,17,18,"And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. Some said, »What would this idle babbler wish to say?« Others, »He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,«because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection."
44,17,19,"And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, »May we know what this new teaching is which you present?"
44,17,20,"For you are bringing some strange things to our ears; so we want to know what these things mean.«"
44,17,21,"(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)"
44,17,22,"So Paul stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: »Men of Athens, I see that in every way you are very religious."
44,17,23,"For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription,"
44,17,24,"The God who made the world and everything in it, since he is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by hands;"
44,17,25,"nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything."
44,17,26,"And he made from one man every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,"
44,17,27,"that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us."
44,17,28,""
44,17,29,"Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man."
44,17,30,"The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,"
44,17,31,"because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given proof to all men by raising him from the dead.«"
44,17,32,"Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, »We want to hear you again on this subject.«"
44,17,33,"So Paul went out from among them."
44,17,34,"But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them."
44,18,1,"After this he left Athens and went to Corinth."
44,18,2,"And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He went to see them,"
44,18,3,"and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them, and they worked, for by trade they were tentmakers."
44,18,4,"And every Sabbath he was reasoning in the synagogue, and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks."
44,18,5,"When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ."
44,18,6,"But when they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, »Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.«"
44,18,7,"Then he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue."
44,18,8,"Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with all his household; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized."
44,18,9,"And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, »Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent;"
44,18,10,"for I am with you, and no man will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.«"
44,18,11,"And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."
44,18,12,"But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack upon Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,"
44,18,13,"saying, »This man is persuading men to worship God contrary to the law.«"
44,18,14,"But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, »If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you;"
44,18,15,"but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I refuse to be a judge of these things.«"
44,18,16,"And he drove them from the judgment seat."
44,18,17,"And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio paid no attention to this."
44,18,18,"After this Paul stayed many days longer, and then took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he had taken a vow."
44,18,19,"They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews."
44,18,20,"When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he declined;"
44,18,21,"but on taking leave of them he said, »I will return to you if God wills,« and he set sail from Ephesus."
44,18,22,"When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch."
44,18,23,"After spending some time there, he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples."
44,18,24,"Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in the scriptures."
44,18,25,"He had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John."
44,18,26,"And he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately."
44,18,27,"And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,"
44,18,28,"for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ."
44,19,1,"While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples."
44,19,2,"And he said to them, »Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?« And they said, »No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.«"
44,19,3,"And he said, »Into what then were you baptized?« They said, »Into John's baptism.«"
44,19,4,"Paul said, »John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.«"
44,19,5,"On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,19,6,"And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied."
44,19,7,"There were about twelve men in all."
44,19,8,"And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, arguing and persuading about the kingdom of God."
44,19,9,"But when some were stubborn and disbelieved, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them, and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus."
44,19,10,"This took place for two years, so that all who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks."
44,19,11,"God did extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,"
44,19,12,"so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick, and diseases left them and the evil spirits went out."
44,19,13,"But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place, attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, »I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.«"
44,19,14,"Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this."
44,19,15,"But the evil spirit answered them, »Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?«"
44,19,16,"And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered all of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
44,19,17,"This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified."
44,19,18,"Many also of those who believed now came, confessing and disclosing their practices."
44,19,19,"And a number of those who practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver."
44,19,20,"So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed."
44,19,21,"Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, »After I have been there, I must also see Rome.«"
44,19,22,"And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while."
44,19,23,"About that time there arose no small disturbance concerning the Way."
44,19,24,"For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen."
44,19,25,"These he gathered together, with the workmen of similar trades, and said, »Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth."
44,19,26,"And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with hands are no gods at all."
44,19,27,"Not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence.«"
44,19,28,"When they heard this, they were enraged and began crying out, »Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!«"
44,19,29,"The city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia."
44,19,30,"Paul wanted to go in among the crowd, but the disciples would not let him."
44,19,31,"Some of the Asiarchs also, who were friends of his, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater."
44,19,32,"Now some were shouting one thing, some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and most of the people did not know why they had come together."
44,19,33,"Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, since the Jews had put him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, wishing to make a defense to the people."
44,19,34,"But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all with one voice shouted, »Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!«"
44,19,35,"And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, »Men of Ephesus, what man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image which fell down from heaven?"
44,19,36,"Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash."
44,19,37,"For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess."
44,19,38,"If then Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another."
44,19,39,"But if you want anything further, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly."
44,19,40,"As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.«"
44,19,41,"After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly."
44,20,1,"After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them, he set out for Macedonia."
44,20,2,"When he had gone through those parts and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece."
44,20,3,"There he spent three months, and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia."
44,20,4,"He was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus, and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia."
44,20,5,"These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas."
44,20,6,"But we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days came to them at Troas, where we stayed seven days."
44,20,7,"On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight."
44,20,8,"There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered."
44,20,9,"And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep. And as Paul talked on and on, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third story and was picked up dead."
44,20,10,"But Paul went down and fell on him, and after embracing him, he said, »Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.«"
44,20,11,"When he had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then left."
44,20,12,"They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted."
44,20,13,"But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there; for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land."
44,20,14,"And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene."
44,20,15,"Sailing from there, we arrived the following day opposite Chios; and the next day we crossed over to Samos; and the day after that we came to Miletus."
44,20,16,"For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost."
44,20,17,"From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church."
44,20,18,"And when they came to him, he said to them: »You yourselves know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day that I set foot in Asia,"
44,20,19,"serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;"
44,20,20,"how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,"
44,20,21,"testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,20,22,"And now, behold, bound in the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,"
44,20,23,"except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me."
44,20,24,"But I do not consider my life of any account nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God."
44,20,25,"And now, behold, I know that all of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will see my face no more."
44,20,26,"Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men."
44,20,27,"For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God."
44,20,28,"Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with the blood of his Own."
44,20,29,"I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;"
44,20,30,"and from among your own selves will arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them."
44,20,31,"Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night and day to admonish each one with tears."
44,20,32,"And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified."
44,20,33,"I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes."
44,20,34,"You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to the men who were with me."
44,20,35,"In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: It is more blessed to give than to receive.«"
44,20,36,"When he had said this, he knelt down and prayed with them all."
44,20,37,"And they all wept and embraced Paul and kissed him,"
44,20,38,"grieving most of all over the word which he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they accompanied him to the ship."
44,21,1,"When we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara."
44,21,2,"And having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail."
44,21,3,"When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo."
44,21,4,"And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem."
44,21,5,"And when our days there were ended, we left and started on our journey, while they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, we said farewell to one another."
44,21,6,"Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home."
44,21,7,"When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we greeted the brethren and stayed with them for a day."
44,21,8,"On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him."
44,21,9,"He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied."
44,21,10,"As we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea."
44,21,11,"And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands, and said, »This is what the Holy Spirit says, In this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.«"
44,21,12,"When we heard this, we and the people there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,13,"Then Paul answered, »What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.«"
44,21,14,"And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, »The will of the Lord be done.«"
44,21,15,"After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem."
44,21,16,"And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to lodge."
44,21,17,"When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly."
44,21,18,"And the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present."
44,21,19,"After he had greeted them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry."
44,21,20,"And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, »You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed; they are all zealous for the law,"
44,21,21,"and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or to walk according to the customs."
44,21,22,"What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come."
44,21,23,"Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;"
44,21,24,"take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself live in observance of the law."
44,21,25,"But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we wrote to them our decision that they should abstain from meat sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication.«"
44,21,26,"The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each one of them."
44,21,27,"When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, upon seeing him in the temple, stirred up all the crowd and laid hands on him,"
44,21,28,"crying out, »Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place; and besides he also brought Greeks into the temple, and he has defiled this holy place.«"
44,21,29,"For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple."
44,21,30,"Then all the city was aroused, and the people rushed together, and taking hold of Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the gates were shut."
44,21,31,"While they were trying to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion."
44,21,32,"At once he took along some soldiers and centurions and ran down to them; and when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul."
44,21,33,"Then the commander came up and arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done."
44,21,34,"Some in the crowd shouted one thing, and some another; and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks."
44,21,35,"When he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;"
44,21,36,"for the mob of the people followed, shouting, »Away with him!«"
44,21,37,"As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, »May I say something to you?« And he said, »Do you know Greek?"
44,21,38,"Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?«"
44,21,39,"Paul replied, »I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city; I beg you, let me speak to the people.«"
44,21,40,"When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned to the people with his hand; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,"
44,22,1,"»Brethren and fathers, hear my defense which I now offer to you.«"
44,22,2,"And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew language, they became more quiet. And he said:"
44,22,3,"»I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today."
44,22,4,"I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women,"
44,22,5,"as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. From them I also received letters to the brethren, and started off for Damascus in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished."
44,22,6,"»As I made my journey and drew near to Damascus, about noon a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me."
44,22,7,"And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
44,22,8,"And I answered, Who are you, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting."
44,22,9,"And those who were with me saw the light, but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me."
44,22,10,"And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Get up and go on into Damascus, and there you will be told of all that has been appointed for you to do."
44,22,11,"But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus."
44,22,12,"»A certain Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,"
44,22,13,"came to me, and standing near said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight! And at that very time I looked up at him."
44,22,14,"Then he said, The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth."
44,22,15,"For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard."
44,22,16,"Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name."
44,22,17,"»When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance"
44,22,18,"and saw him saying to me, Make haste, and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me."
44,22,19,"And I said, Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in you."
44,22,20,"When the blood of Stephen your witness was shed, I also was standing by and approving, and keeping the garments of those who were killing him."
44,22,21,"And he said to me, Go; for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.«"
44,22,22,"Up to this word they listened to him, and then they raised their voices and said, »Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he ought not to live.«"
44,22,23,"And as they were crying out and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,"
44,22,24,"the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and commanded him to be examined by scourging so that he might find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way."
44,22,25,"But when they stretched him out with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, »Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?«"
44,22,26,"When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and told him, saying, »What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.«"
44,22,27,"So the commander came and said to him, »Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?« And he said, »Yes.«"
44,22,28,"The commander answered, »I bought this citizenship for a large sum.« Paul said, »But I was born a citizen.«"
44,22,29,"So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately; and the commander also was afraid when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had put him in chains."
44,22,30,"But on the next day, wishing to know for certain why he had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble, and brought Paul down and set him before them."
44,23,1,"And Paul, looking intently at the council, said, »Brethren, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.«"
44,23,2,"The high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth."
44,23,3,"Then Paul said to him, »God shall strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?«"
44,23,4,"Those who stood by said, »Would you revile God's high priest?«"
44,23,5,"And Paul said, »I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.«"
44,23,6,"But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, »Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead I am on trial.«"
44,23,7,"When he said this, a dissension broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided."
44,23,8,"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor an angel, nor a spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all."
44,23,9,"There occurred a great uproar; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and began to argue heatedly, saying, »We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?«"
44,23,10,"The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them and ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks."
44,23,11,"The following night the Lord stood by him and said, »Take courage, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must bear witness also at Rome.«"
44,23,12,"When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they had killed Paul."
44,23,13,"There were more than forty who formed this plot."
44,23,14,"They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, »We have bound ourselves under a solemn oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul."
44,23,15,"You therefore, along with the council, give notice now to the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.«"
44,23,16,"But the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, and he went and entered the barracks and told Paul."
44,23,17,"Paul called one of the centurions and said, »Take this young man to the commander; for he has something to tell him.«"
44,23,18,"So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, »Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, since he has something to tell you.«"
44,23,19,"The commander took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, »What is it that you have to tell me?«"
44,23,20,"And he said, »The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him."
44,23,21,"But do not yield to them; for more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him, having bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.«"
44,23,22,"So the commander dismissed the young man, instructing him, »Tell no one that you have informed me of this.«"
44,23,23,"Then he called two of the centurions and said, »At the third hour of the night get ready two hundred soldiers with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea."
44,23,24,"Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.«"
44,23,25,"And he wrote a letter having this form:"
44,23,26,"»Claudius Lysias, to His Excellency, Governor Felix: greetings."
44,23,27,"This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came upon them with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen."
44,23,28,"And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council."
44,23,29,"I found that he was accused over questions about their Law, but there was no accusation against him deserving death or imprisonment."
44,23,30,"And when I was informed that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you.«"
44,23,31,"So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris."
44,23,32,"But the next day, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the barracks."
44,23,33,"When these had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him."
44,23,34,"When he had read the letter, he asked from what province he was, and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,"
44,23,35,"he said, »I will hear you when your accusers arrive also.« And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium."
44,24,1,"After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders, with an attorney named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor."
44,24,2,"And when Paul was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying to Felix: »Since through you we have enjoyed much peace, and since by your provision, reforms are introduced on behalf of this nation,"
44,24,3,"we acknowledge this in every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude."
44,24,4,"But, that I may not weary you further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly."
44,24,5,"For we have found this man a pestilent fellow who stirs up dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes."
44,24,6,"He even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him."
44,24,7,""
44,24,8,"By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges of which we accuse him.«"
44,24,9,"The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so."
44,24,10,"When the governor had motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: »Realizing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense."
44,24,11,"Since you can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship."
44,24,12,"They did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues, or in the city."
44,24,13,"Neither can they prove to you the charges they are now making against me."
44,24,14,"But this I admit to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect I do worship the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,"
44,24,15,"having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves, that there will certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked."
44,24,16,"And so I do my best always to have a clear conscience before God and men."
44,24,17,"Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings."
44,24,18,"As I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or uproar. But there were some Jews from Asia"
44,24,19,"who ought to be here before you and to make accusation, if they should have anything against me."
44,24,20,"Or else let these men themselves tell what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the Council,"
44,24,21,"except this one thing which I shouted out while standing among them, With respect to the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.«"
44,24,22,"But Felix, having a more exact knowledge about the Way, put them off, saying, »When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case.«"
44,24,23,"Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody but have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to his needs."
44,24,24,"But some days later Felix came with Drusilla, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus."
44,24,25,"But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, »Go away for the present, and when I find time I will summon you.«"
44,24,26,"At the same time, he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him."
44,24,27,"But when two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison."
44,25,1,"Festus then, three days after arriving in the province, went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea."
44,25,2,"And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews brought charges against Paul; and they urged him,"
44,25,3,"as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way."
44,25,4,"Festus answered that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and that he himself intended to go there shortly."
44,25,5,"»Therefore,« he said, »let the men of authority among you go there with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them prosecute him.«"
44,25,6,"After he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought."
44,25,7,"And when Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they could not prove."
44,25,8,"Paul said in his defense, »Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended at all.«"
44,25,9,"But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, »Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?«"
44,25,10,"But Paul said, »I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know."
44,25,11,"If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of the charges brought against me is true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.«"
44,25,12,"Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, »You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go.«"
44,25,13,"Now when a few days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and paid their respects to Festus."
44,25,14,"While they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, »There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix;"
44,25,15,"and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for sentence against him."
44,25,16,"I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges."
44,25,17,"When therefore they came together here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in."
44,25,18,"When the accusers stood up, they did not charge him of such crimes as I had expected,"
44,25,19,"but they simply had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man, Jesus, whom Paul asserted to be alive."
44,25,20,"Being at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these matters."
44,25,21,"But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I could send him to Caesar."
44,25,22,"Then Agrippa said to Festus, »I also would like to hear the man myself.« »Tomorrow,« he said, »you shall hear him.«"
44,25,23,"So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high ranking officers and the prominent men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in."
44,25,24,"Festus said, »King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer."
44,25,25,"But I found that he had done nothing deserving of death; and as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to send him."
44,25,26,"But I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken place, I may have something to write."
44,25,27,"For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him.«"
44,26,1,"Agrippa said to Paul, »You have permission to speak for yourself.« Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense:"
44,26,2,"»I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews,"
44,26,3,"because you are especially familiar with all customs and controversies of the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently."
44,26,4,"So then, all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth up, which from the beginning was spent among my own nation and at Jerusalem."
44,26,5,"They have known about me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I lived as a Pharisee according to the strictest sect of our religion."
44,26,6,"And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers;"
44,26,7,"the promise to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly serve God night and day. And for this hope, O King, I am being accused by Jews."
44,26,8,"Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?"
44,26,9,"I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
44,26,10,"And that is just what I did in Jerusalem; I not only shut up many of the saints in prison, by authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them."
44,26,11,"And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities."
44,26,12,"»On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests."
44,26,13,"At midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me."
44,26,14,"And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads."
44,26,15,"And I said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting."
44,26,16,"But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness to the things which you have seen of me, and also to the things in which I will appear to you;"
44,26,17,"rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,"
44,26,18,"to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me."
44,26,19,"»So, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,"
44,26,20,"but declared first to those at Damascus, then at Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and perform deeds worthy of their repentance."
44,26,21,"For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me."
44,26,22,"To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen:"
44,26,23,"that the Christ must suffer, and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.«"
44,26,24,"And as he was saying this in his defense, Festus said in a loud voice, »Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great learning is driving you mad.«"
44,26,25,"But Paul said, »I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the sober truth."
44,26,26,"For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner."
44,26,27,"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do.«"
44,26,28,"And Agrippa said to Paul, »In a short time you think to persuade me to become a Christian!«"
44,26,29,"And Paul said, »Whether in a short or a long time, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I amexcept for these chains.«"
44,26,30,"The king rose and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them,"
44,26,31,"and when they had gone aside, they began talking to one another, saying, »This man is not doing anything worthy of death or imprisonment.«"
44,26,32,"And Agrippa said to Festus, »This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.«"
44,27,1,"When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius."
44,27,2,"And embarking in a ship from Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica."
44,27,3,"The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and allowed him to go to his friends and be cared for."
44,27,4,"We put out to sea from there and sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us."
44,27,5,"When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia."
44,27,6,"There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it."
44,27,7,"When we had sailed slowly for a good many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, since the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete, off Salmone."
44,27,8,"We sailed along it with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea."
44,27,9,"As much time had been lost, and the voyage was now dangerous because the fast had already gone by, Paul advised them,"
44,27,10,"and said to them, »Men, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.«"
44,27,11,"But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship than by what was being said by Paul."
44,27,12,"Because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there."
44,27,13,"When a gentle south wind came up, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and began sailing along Crete, close inshore."
44,27,14,"But before very long there rushed down from the land a violent wind, called the northeaster;"
44,27,15,"and when the ship was caught in it and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along."
44,27,16,"And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were scarcely able to secure the boat."
44,27,17,"After they had hoisted it up, they used supporting cables to undergird the ship; and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and in this way let themselves be driven along."
44,27,18,"The next day as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to throw the cargo overboard;"
44,27,19,"and on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands."
44,27,20,"When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was raging on us, all hope of our being saved was finally abandoned."
44,27,21,"When they had gone a long time without food, then Paul stood up among them and said, »Men, you should have followed my advice and not to have set sail from Crete and incurred this damage and loss."
44,27,22,"Yet now I urge you to keep up your courage; for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship."
44,27,23,"For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood before me,"
44,27,24,"and he said, Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you."
44,27,25,"So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen exactly as I have been told."
44,27,26,"But we must run aground on some island.«"
44,27,27,"But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors began to sense that they were approaching land."
44,27,28,"They took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and a little farther on they took soundings again and found it to be fifteen fathoms."
44,27,29,"Fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks, they cast four anchors from the stern and prayed for daybreak."
44,27,30,"But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship and had let down the lifeboat into the sea, on the pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,"
44,27,31,"Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, »Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.«"
44,27,32,"Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the lifeboat and let it fall away."
44,27,33,"As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, »Today is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense and without food, having taken nothing."
44,27,34,"Therefore I urge you to take some food; it will give you strength, since not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you.«"
44,27,35,"Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke it and began to eat."
44,27,36,"Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves."
44,27,37,"All of us in the ship were two hundred and seventy-six persons."
44,27,38,"When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing out the wheat into the sea."
44,27,39,"When day came, they could not recognize the land, but they did observe a bay with a beach, and they resolved to drive the ship onto it if they could."
44,27,40,"So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders; then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach."
44,27,41,"But striking a sandbar they ran the vessel aground; the bow stuck fast and remained immovable, and the stern was broken up by the pounding of the surf."
44,27,42,"The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim away and escape."
44,27,43,"But the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land,"
44,27,44,"and the rest on planks or on various pieces of the ship. And so it happened that they were all brought safely to land."
44,28,1,"When we had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta."
44,28,2,"The natives showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold."
44,28,3,"But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand."
44,28,4,"When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, »No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.«"
44,28,5,"However he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm."
44,28,6,"They waited, expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead; but after they had waited a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god."
44,28,7,"Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days."
44,28,8,"It happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed sick with recurrent fever and dysentery; and Paul went in to see him and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him."
44,28,9,"When this had happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured."
44,28,10,"They honored us in many ways; and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed."
44,28,11,"After three months we set sail in a ship which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian ship, with the Twin Brothers as figurehead."
44,28,12,"After we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days."
44,28,13,"From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium, and a day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli."
44,28,14,"There we found some brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome."
44,28,15,"And the brethren, when they heard of us, came from there as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage."
44,28,16,"And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier that guarded him."
44,28,17,"After three days Paul called together the local leaders of the Jews; and when they had gathered, he said to them, »Brethren, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
44,28,18,"And when they had examined me, they were willing to release me because there was no ground for putting me to death."
44,28,19,"But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesarnot that I had any charge to bring against my own nation."
44,28,20,"For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.«"
44,28,21,"They said to him, »We have not received letters from Judea concerning you, and none of the brethren who have come here has reported or spoken anything bad about you."
44,28,22,"But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against.«"
44,28,23,"When they had appointed a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in great numbers. And he explained the matter to them from morning till evening, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the law of Moses and from the prophets."
44,28,24,"Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe."
44,28,25,"When they disagreed among themselves, they began to leave, after Paul had made one final statement: »The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:"
44,28,26,"saying,"
44,28,27,""
44,28,28,"Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen.«"
44,28,29,""
44,28,30,"And he stayed there two whole years in his own rented quarters and welcomed all who came to him,"
44,28,31,"preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ quite openly and unhindered."
45,1,1,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God"
45,1,2,"which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures,"
45,1,3,"concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,"
45,1,4,"and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,1,5,"Through him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,"
45,1,6,"among whom you also are called to belong to Jesus Christ;"
45,1,7,"To all in Rome who are beloved of God, called to be saints:"
45,1,8,"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world."
45,1,9,"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers,"
45,1,10,"asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last find the way to come to you."
45,1,11,"For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you"
45,1,12,"that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith."
45,1,13,"I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that I often planned to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have some harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles."
45,1,14,"I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish:"
45,1,15,"so I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome."
45,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek."
45,1,17,"For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, »The just shall live by faith.«"
45,1,18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of men who by their wickedness suppress the truth,"
45,1,19,"for what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them."
45,1,20,"For since the creation of the world his invisible nature, even his eternal power and deity, has been clearly seen, being understood by the things that have been made. So they are without excuse;"
45,1,21,"for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened."
45,1,22,"Claiming to be wise, they became fools,"
45,1,23,"and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles."
45,1,24,"Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,"
45,1,25,"because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen."
45,1,26,"For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural."
45,1,27,"And the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error."
45,1,28,"And since they did not see fit to retain the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a base mind, to do what ought not to be done."
45,1,29,"They were filled with all manner of wickedness, evil, covetousness, depravity. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,"
45,1,30,"slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,"
45,1,31,"foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless."
45,1,32,"Though they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them."
45,2,1,"Therefore you have no excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge another; for in whatever point you pass judgment on him you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, are doing the very same things."
45,2,2,"We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things."
45,2,3,"Do you think, O man, that when you judge those who do such things and yet do the same yourself, you will escape the judgment of God?"
45,2,4,"Or do you presume upon the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience? Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?"
45,2,5,"But by your hardness and your impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed."
45,2,6,"For he »will render to each one according to his works«:"
45,2,7,"to those who by patience in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality, he will give eternal life;"
45,2,8,"but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury."
45,2,9,"There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,"
45,2,10,"but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek."
45,2,11,"For God shows no partiality."
45,2,12,"All who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law."
45,2,13,"For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in the sight of God, but the doers of the law who will be justified."
45,2,14,"When Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law."
45,2,15,"They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or else excusing them"
45,2,16,"on that day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men by Christ Jesus."
45,2,17,"But if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the law and boast of your relation to God"
45,2,18,"and know his will and approve of what is excellent, because you are instructed in the law,"
45,2,19,"and if you are sure that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,"
45,2,20,"an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth"
45,2,21,"you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?"
45,2,22,"You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?"
45,2,23,"You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?"
45,2,24,"For, as it is written, »The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.«"
45,2,25,"Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision."
45,2,26,"So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?"
45,2,27,"The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a breaker of the law."
45,2,28,"For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something outward and in the flesh."
45,2,29,"He is a Jew who is one inwardly; and real circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, and not by the written code. His praise is not from men but from God."
45,3,1,"Then what advantage has the Jew, or what is the value of circumcision?"
45,3,2,"Much in every way! To begin with, they are entrusted with the oracles of God."
45,3,3,"What if some did not have faith? Will their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?"
45,3,4,"Certainly not! Let God be true, though every man a liar. As it is written:"
45,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)"
45,3,6,"Certainly not! For then how could God judge the world?"
45,3,7,"But if through my falsehood God's truthfulness abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?"
45,3,8,"Why not say  as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say»Let us do evil that good may come«? Their condemnation is just."
45,3,9,"What then? Are we Jews any better off? Certainly not; for we have already charged that all men, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power of sin."
45,3,10,"As it is written:"
45,3,11,""
45,3,12,""
45,3,13,""
45,3,14,""
45,3,15,""
45,3,16,""
45,3,17,""
45,3,18,""
45,3,19,"Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped and the whole world may be held accountable to God."
45,3,20,"Therefore no flesh will be justified in his sight by works of the law, for through the law comes knowledge of sin."
45,3,21,"But now the righteousness of God has been revealed apart from law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it,"
45,3,22,"the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. For there is no difference,"
45,3,23,"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,"
45,3,24,"and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,"
45,3,25,"whom God put forward as an atoning sacrifice by his blood, to be received through faith. This was to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over sins committed beforehand;"
45,3,26,"and it was to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus."
45,3,27,"Where then is our boasting? It is excluded. On what law? On the law of works? No, but on the law of faith."
45,3,28,"For we hold that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law."
45,3,29,"Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,"
45,3,30,"since there is one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through their faith."
45,3,31,"Do we then nullify the law by this faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we uphold the law."
45,4,1,"What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found?"
45,4,2,"For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God."
45,4,3,"For what does the scripture say? »Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.«"
45,4,4,"Now to him who works, his wages are not reckoned as a gift but as his due."
45,4,5,"And to one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness."
45,4,6,"So also David describes the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works:"
45,4,7,""
45,4,8,""
45,4,9,"Is this blessedness only upon the circumcised, or also upon the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness."
45,4,10,"How then was it reckoned to him? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before he was circumcised."
45,4,11,"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be reckoned to them."
45,4,12,"And he is also the father of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised."
45,4,13,"The promise to Abraham and his descendants, that he would be heir of the world, was not through the law but through the righteousness of faith."
45,4,14,"For if those who are of the law are to be the heirs, faith has no value and the promise is void,"
45,4,15,"because the law brings wrath, for where there is no law there is no transgression."
45,4,16,"Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all his descendantsnot only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, for he is the father of us all"
45,4,17,"(as it is written, »I have made you the father of many nations«) in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls things that do not exist as though they did."
45,4,18,"In hope, he believed against hope, so that he became the father of many nations; as he had been told, »So shall your descendants be.«"
45,4,19,"And he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb."
45,4,20,"He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,"
45,4,21,"being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised."
45,4,22,"That is why it was »reckoned to him as righteousness.«"
45,4,23,"But the words, »it was reckoned to him,« were written not for his sake alone,"
45,4,24,"but for us also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,"
45,4,25,"who was delivered to death for our sins and was raised for our justification."
45,5,1,"Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
45,5,2,"through whom we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in our hope of the glory of God."
45,5,3,"And not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces perseverance;"
45,5,4,"and perseverance, character; and character, hope."
45,5,5,"And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."
45,5,6,"When we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly."
45,5,7,"Why, one will hardly die for a righteous manthough perhaps for a good man one will dare even to die."
45,5,8,"But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us."
45,5,9,"Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved through him from the wrath of God."
45,5,10,"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved by his life."
45,5,11,"Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received our reconciliation."
45,5,12,"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to all men, because all men sinned."
45,5,13,"For sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted when there is no law."
45,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come."
45,5,15,"But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if by the one man's trespass many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many."
45,5,16,"And the free gift is not like the effect of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the gift following many trespasses brings justification."
45,5,17,"For if, by the one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.)"
45,5,18,"So then, as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men."
45,5,19,"For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous."
45,5,20,"Law came in, that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,"
45,5,21,"so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?"
45,6,2,"Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live any longer in it?"
45,6,3,"Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?"
45,6,4,"We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life."
45,6,5,"For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his."
45,6,6,"We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin."
45,6,7,"For he who has died has been freed from sin."
45,6,8,"Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him."
45,6,9,"For we know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him."
45,6,10,"The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God."
45,6,11,"So you also, consider yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus."
45,6,12,"Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you obey its passions."
45,6,13,"Do not yield your members to sin as instruments of wickedness, but yield yourselves to God as men who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness."
45,6,14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace."
45,6,15,"What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not!"
45,6,16,"Do you not know that if you yield yourselves to any one to obey as slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, whether of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?"
45,6,17,"But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,"
45,6,18,"and, having been set free from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness."
45,6,19,"I am speaking in human terms, because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now yield your members to righteousness for holiness."
45,6,20,"When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness."
45,6,21,"But then what return did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death."
45,6,22,"But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the return you get is holiness and its end, eternal life."
45,6,23,"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,7,1,"Do you not know, brethrenfor I am speaking to those who know the lawthat the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?"
45,7,2,"For a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of her husband."
45,7,3,"So then, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and though she marries another man, she is not an adulteress."
45,7,4,"Likewise, my brethren, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit to God."
45,7,5,"While we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death."
45,7,6,"But now, by dying to what once held us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code."
45,7,7,"What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed, I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, »You shall not covet.«"
45,7,8,"But sin, finding opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetous desire. For apart from the law sin lies dead."
45,7,9,"I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died."
45,7,10,"The very commandment which was to bring life I found to be death to me."
45,7,11,"For sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me."
45,7,12,"So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good."
45,7,13,"Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Certainly not! But it was sin, working death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, so that through the commandment sin might become sinful beyond measure."
45,7,14,"We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin."
45,7,15,"I do not understand what I do. For I do not do what I want to do, but I do what I hate."
45,7,16,"Now if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good."
45,7,17,"So then, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me."
45,7,18,"For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will to do what is good, but I cannot do it."
45,7,19,"For I do not do the good I want to do; but the evil I do not want to do is what I do."
45,7,20,"Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me."
45,7,21,"So I find it to be a law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me."
45,7,22,"For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,"
45,7,23,"but I see in my members another law, at war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin which dwells in my members."
45,7,24,"Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?"
45,7,25,"Thanks be to Godthrough Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I of myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin."
45,8,1,"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
45,8,2,"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death."
45,8,3,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weakened through the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin: he condemned sin in the flesh,"
45,8,4,"in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit."
45,8,5,"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit."
45,8,6,"To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace."
45,8,7,"For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so;"
45,8,8,"and those who are in the flesh cannot please God."
45,8,9,"But you are not in the flesh, you are in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ he does not belong to him."
45,8,10,"But if Christ is in you, although your body is dead because of sin, your spirit is alive because of righteousness."
45,8,11,"If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit who dwells in you."
45,8,12,"Therefore, brethren, we are debtorsnot to the flesh, to live according to the flesh."
45,8,13,"For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live."
45,8,14,"For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God."
45,8,15,"For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship by whom we cry out, »Abba, Father.«"
45,8,16,"The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,"
45,8,17,"and if children, then heirsheirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, in order that we may also be glorified with him."
45,8,18,"I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed in us."
45,8,19,"For the creation waits with eager expectation for the revealing of the sons of God."
45,8,20,"For the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but by the will of him who subjected it in hope;"
45,8,21,"because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God."
45,8,22,"We know that the whole creation has been groaning in birth pangs together until now."
45,8,23,"And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies."
45,8,24,"For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?"
45,8,25,"But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience."
45,8,26,"Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express."
45,8,27,"And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God."
45,8,28,"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who are called according to his purpose."
45,8,29,"For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren."
45,8,30,"And those whom he predestined, he also called; those whom he called, he also justified; and those whom he justified, he also glorified."
45,8,31,"What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?"
45,8,32,"He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also give us all things with him?"
45,8,33,"Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies."
45,8,34,"Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who is also interceding for us."
45,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
45,8,36,"As it is written:"
45,8,37,"No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us."
45,8,38,"For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,"
45,8,39,"nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,9,1,"I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit,"
45,9,2,"that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart."
45,9,3,"For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh."
45,9,4,"They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises."
45,9,5,"Of them are the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, forever blessed. Amen."
45,9,6,"But it is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel,"
45,9,7,"nor are they all children of Abraham because they are his descendants; but, »Through Isaac shall your descendants be named.«"
45,9,8,"In other words, it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned as descendants."
45,9,9,"For this is what the promise said: »About this time I will return and Sarah shall have a son.«"
45,9,10,"And not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our father Isaac,"
45,9,11,"though the twins were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad, in order that God's purpose of election might stand, not because of works but because of his call,"
45,9,12,"she was told, »The older will serve the younger.«"
45,9,13,"As it is written,"
45,9,14,"What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Certainly not!"
45,9,15,"For he says to Moses,"
45,9,16,"So it depends not upon man's will or exertion, but upon God's mercy."
45,9,17,"For the scripture says to Pharaoh, »I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I may show my power in you, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.«"
45,9,18,"Therefore he has mercy on whom he wills, and he hardens the heart of whom he wills."
45,9,19,"You will say to me then, »Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?«"
45,9,20,"But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is formed say to him who formed it, »Why have you made me like this?«"
45,9,21,"Does not the potter have right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?"
45,9,22,"What if God, choosing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,"
45,9,23,"in order to make known the riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory,"
45,9,24,"even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?"
45,9,25,"As indeed he says in Hosea:"
45,9,26,""
45,9,27,"And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: »Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved."
45,9,28,"For the Lord will carry out his sentence on the earth with speed and finality.«"
45,9,29,"And as Isaiah said:"
45,9,30,"What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, righteousness through faith;"
45,9,31,"but Israel, who pursued the law of righteousness, has not attained that law."
45,9,32,"Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,"
45,9,33,"as it is written:"
45,10,1,"Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved."
45,10,2,"For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but it is not according to knowledge."
45,10,3,"For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness."
45,10,4,"For Christ is the end of the law, that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes."
45,10,5,"For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, »The man who does those things shall live by them.«"
45,10,6,"But the righteousness based on faith says, »Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?« (that is, to bring Christ down)"
45,10,7,"or »Who will descend into the abyss?« (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead)."
45,10,8,"But what does it say?"
45,10,9,"because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
45,10,10,"For man believes with his heart and so is justified, and he confesses with his mouth and so is saved."
45,10,11,"The scripture says, »No one who believes in him will be put to shame.«"
45,10,12,"For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches on all who call upon him."
45,10,13,"For, »everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.«"
45,10,14,"How then can they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without a preacher?"
45,10,15,"And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, »How beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news!«"
45,10,16,"But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, »Lord, who has believed our message?«"
45,10,17,"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ."
45,10,18,"But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for"
45,10,19,"Again I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says,"
45,10,20,"But Isaiah is very bold and says,"
45,10,21,"But of Israel he says, »All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.«"
45,11,1,"I ask, then, has God rejected his people? Certainly not! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin."
45,11,2,"God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?"
45,11,3,"»Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.«"
45,11,4,"But what is God's reply to him? »I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.«"
45,11,5,"So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace."
45,11,6,"And if it is by grace, then it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace."
45,11,7,"What then? Israel did not obtain what it sought. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,"
45,11,8,"as it is written:"
45,11,9,"And David says:"
45,11,10,""
45,11,11,"So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? Certainly not! But through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel jealous."
45,11,12,"Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness mean!"
45,11,13,"Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry"
45,11,14,"in the hope that I may somehow arouse to jealousy the kinsmen of my flesh and save some of them."
45,11,15,"For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?"
45,11,16,"If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole lump is holy; and if the root is holy, so are the branches."
45,11,17,"And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the rest to share the root of the olive tree,"
45,11,18,"do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you."
45,11,19,"You will say then, »Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.«"
45,11,20,"That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only by faith. So do not be proud, but stand in awe."
45,11,21,"For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either."
45,11,22,"Therefore consider the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who fell, but kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off."
45,11,23,"And they also, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again."
45,11,24,"For if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and were grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree!"
45,11,25,"I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in."
45,11,26,"And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written:"
45,11,27,""
45,11,28,"As regards the gospel they are enemies of God, for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers."
45,11,29,"For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable."
45,11,30,"Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,"
45,11,31,"so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy."
45,11,32,"For God has bound all men over to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all."
45,11,33,"Oh, the depth of the riches and of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out!"
45,11,34,""
45,11,35,""
45,11,36,"For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen."
45,12,1,"I appeal to you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship."
45,12,2,"Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect."
45,12,3,"For by the grace given to me I say to every one among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith which God has assigned him."
45,12,4,"For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function,"
45,12,5,"so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another."
45,12,6,"Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith;"
45,12,7,"if service, let us use it in our serving; he who teaches, in his teaching;"
45,12,8,"he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness."
45,12,9,"Let love be genuine. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good."
45,12,10,"Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; outdo one another in showing honor."
45,12,11,"Never be lacking in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord."
45,12,12,"Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be faithful in prayer."
45,12,13,"Contribute to the needs of the saints, practice hospitality."
45,12,14,"Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse."
45,12,15,"Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep."
45,12,16,"Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but associate with the lowly. Do not be conceited."
45,12,17,"Repay no one evil for evil, but have regard for what is noble in the sight of all."
45,12,18,"If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all."
45,12,19,"Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God; for it is written, »Vengeance is mine, I will repay,« says the Lord."
45,12,20,"No, »if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for in so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.«"
45,12,21,"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
45,13,1,"Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist have been instituted by God."
45,13,2,"Therefore he who resists the authority resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves."
45,13,3,"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to have no fear of him who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will have praise from him."
45,13,4,"For he is God's servant to you for good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain; he is Gods servant, an avenger to execute wrath on the wrongdoer."
45,13,5,"Therefore one must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for the sake of conscience."
45,13,6,"For the same reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are God's ministers, attending to this very thing."
45,13,7,"Pay all of them their dues: taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due."
45,13,8,"Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law."
45,13,9,"The commandments, »You shall not commit adultery,« »You shall not murder,« »You shall not steal,« »You shall not covet,« and any other commandment there may be, are summed up in this sentence, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself.«"
45,13,10,"Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law."
45,13,11,"And do this, knowing the hour, that now it is full time for you to wake from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed."
45,13,12,"The night is far gone, the day is at hand. Let us then cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light."
45,13,13,"Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust, not in quarreling and jealousy."
45,13,14,"But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires."
45,14,1,"As for the man who is weak in faith, accept him, but not for disputes over opinions."
45,14,2,"One believes he may eat anything, but the man whose faith is weak eats only vegetables."
45,14,3,"Let not him who eats despise him who does not, and let not him who does not eat pass judgment on him who eats; for God has accepted him."
45,14,4,"Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will be made to stand, for the Master is able to make him stand."
45,14,5,"One man esteems one day as better than another; another man esteems every day alike. Let each one be fully convinced in his own mind."
45,14,6,"He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God."
45,14,7,"For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself."
45,14,8,"If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's."
45,14,9,"For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living."
45,14,10,"Why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God."
45,14,11,"For it is written:"
45,14,12,"So then each of us shall give account of himself to God."
45,14,13,"Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another anymore, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in our brothers way."
45,14,14,"I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean."
45,14,15,"If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not by your eating destroy the one for whom Christ died."
45,14,16,"So do not let your good be spoken of as evil."
45,14,17,"For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit;"
45,14,18,"he who serves Christ in this way is acceptable to God and approved by men."
45,14,19,"Let us therefore pursue what makes for peace and for mutual edification."
45,14,20,"Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble."
45,14,21,"It is right not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother stumble."
45,14,22,"The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself for what he approves."
45,14,23,"But he who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not act from faith; for whatever is not from faith is sin."
45,15,1,"We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves."
45,15,2,"Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up."
45,15,3,"For even Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written, »The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.«"
45,15,4,"For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through perseverance and the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope."
45,15,5,"May the God of patience and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, according to Christ Jesus,"
45,15,6,"that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
45,15,7,"Therefore, welcome one another, just as Christ also welcomed you, to the glory of God."
45,15,8,"For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised to show God's truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs,"
45,15,9,"and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written:"
45,15,10,"and again it says:"
45,15,11,"and again,"
45,15,12,"And again, Isaiah says:"
45,15,13,"May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope."
45,15,14,"I myself am satisfied about you, my brethren, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another."
45,15,15,"But I have written very boldly to you on some points, so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God,"
45,15,16,"to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
45,15,17,"Therefore I have reason to glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God."
45,15,18,"For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed"
45,15,19,"by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit, so that from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ."
45,15,20,"And so I have made it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on another man's foundation,"
45,15,21,"but as it is written:"
45,15,22,"This is the reason why I have often been hindered from coming to you."
45,15,23,"But now, since I no longer have any place for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you,"
45,15,24,"I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through, and to be helped by you on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while."
45,15,25,"Now, however, I am going to Jerusalem with aid for the saints."
45,15,26,"For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem."
45,15,27,"They were pleased to do it, and indeed they are in debt to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings."
45,15,28,"When therefore I have completed this, and have delivered to them this fruit, I shall go on by way of you to Spain."
45,15,29,"And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ."
45,15,30,"Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,"
45,15,31,"that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,"

45,16,17,"I urge you, brethren, to take note of those who cause divisions and difficulties, contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; avoid them."
45,16,18,"For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth and flattering words they deceive the hearts of the simple."

46,1,14,"I am thankful that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,"
46,1,15,"so that no one would say you were baptized in my name."
46,1,16,"(Now I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any one else.)"
46,1,17,"For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospelnot with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power."
46,1,18,"For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God."
46,1,19,"For it is written,"
46,1,20,"Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?"
46,1,21,"For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe."
46,1,22,"Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,"
46,1,23,"but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,"
46,1,24,"but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."
46,1,25,"For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
46,1,26,"For consider your call, brethren; not many of you were wise according to fleshly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth."
46,1,27,"But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong,"
46,1,28,"God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things, and the things that are not, to nullify the things that are,"

46,1,30,"It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,"
46,1,31,"therefore, as it is written, »Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.«"
46,2,1,"When I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God."
46,2,2,"For I resolved to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
46,2,3,"I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,"
46,2,4,"and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,"
46,2,5,"so that your faith might not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God."
46,2,6,"Yet we do speak a wisdom among the mature, a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away."
46,2,7,"But we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and which God destined for our glory before the ages."
46,2,8,"None of the rulers of this age understood it; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
46,2,9,"But, as it is written,"
46,2,10,"God has revealed them to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God."
46,2,11,"For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit which is in him? Even so no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God."
46,2,12,"Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand the things freely given to us by God."
46,2,13,"This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words."
46,2,14,"But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned."
46,2,15,"But the spiritual man judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one."
46,2,16,""
46,3,1,"But I, brethren, could not address you as spiritual men, but as carnal men, as infants in Christ."
46,3,2,"I gave you milk, not solid food; for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, even now you are not ready,"
46,3,3,"for you are still carnal. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not carnal, and are you not walking like mere men?"
46,3,4,"For when one says, »I am of Paul,« and another, »I am of Apollos,« are you not mere men?"
46,3,5,"What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord assigned to each one."
46,3,6,"I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth."
46,3,7,"So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth."
46,3,8,"Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor."

46,3,10,"According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it."
46,3,11,"For no other foundation can any one lay than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
46,3,12,"Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,"
46,3,13,"each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it, because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each mans work."
46,3,14,"If any man's work which he has built on it survives, he will receive a reward."
46,3,15,"If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, but only as through fire."
46,3,16,"Do you not know that you are God's temple and that Gods Spirit dwells in you?"
46,3,17,"If any one destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For Gods temple is holy, and that temple you are."
46,3,18,"Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become a fool so that he may become wise."
46,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written,"
46,3,20,"and again,"
46,3,21,"So then let no one boast of men. For all things are yours,"
46,3,22,"whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future; all belong to you,"
46,3,23,"and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God."
46,4,1,"This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God."
46,4,2,"Moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy."
46,4,3,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by any human court; I do not even judge myself."
46,4,4,"I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not acquitted by this. It is the Lord who judges me."
46,4,5,"Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men's hearts. Then every man will receive his praise from God."
46,4,6,"Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in favor of one against the other."
46,4,7,"For who regards you as different? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?"
46,4,8,"You are already filled! You have already become rich! You have become kings without us! And indeed, I wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you."
46,4,9,"For, I think that God has exhibited us apostles last of all, like men condemned to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men."
46,4,10,"We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are distinguished, but we are without honor."
46,4,11,"To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty, and we are poorly clothed, and roughly treated, and homeless;"
46,4,12,"and we toil, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure;"
46,4,13,"when we are slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become, and are now, as the scum of the world, the refuse of all things."
46,4,14,"I do not write this to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children."
46,4,15,"For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel."
46,4,16,"Therefore I urge you, be imitators of me."
46,4,17,"For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church."
46,4,18,"Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you."
46,4,19,"But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out, not the words of these arrogant people, but their power."
46,4,20,"For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power."
46,4,21,"What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?"
46,5,1,"It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans: a man has his father's wife."
46,5,2,"And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to have mourned? Let the one who has done this be removed from your midst."
46,5,3,"For though I am absent in body, I am present in spirit, and have already passed judgment on the one who has committed this, as if I were present."
46,5,4,"In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,"
46,5,5,"you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
46,5,6,"Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough?"
46,5,7,"Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed."
46,5,8,"Let us, therefore, celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
46,5,9,"I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people;"
46,5,10,"not at all meaning the immoral people of this world, or with the greedy and swindlers, or with idolaters, for then you would have to go out of the world."
46,5,11,"But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any one who bears the name of brother if he is an immoral person, or greedy, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindlernot even to eat with such a one."
46,5,12,"For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?"
46,5,13,"God judges those outside. »Expel the wicked man from among you.«"
46,6,1,"When any one of you has a grievance against a brother, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of before the saints?"
46,6,2,"Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to try trivial cases?"
46,6,3,"Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more matters of this life!"
46,6,4,"So if you have disputes about such matters, do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church?"
46,6,5,"I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no man among you wise enough to decide between his brethren,"
46,6,6,"but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?"
46,6,7,"Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?"
46,6,8,"Instead, you yourselves defraud and do wrong, and you even do this to your brethren."
46,6,9,"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor sexual perverts,"
46,6,10,"nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."
46,6,11,"And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God."
46,6,12,"»All things are lawful for me,« but not all things are helpful. »All things are lawful for me,« but I will not be mastered by anything."
46,6,13,"»Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food«but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body."
46,6,14,"By his power God raised the Lord, and he will also raise us up."
46,6,15,"Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!"
46,6,16,"Or do you not know that he who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, »The two shall become one flesh.«"
46,6,17,"But he who unites himself with the Lord is one spirit with him."
46,6,18,"Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body."
46,6,19,"Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;"
46,6,20,"you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body."
46,7,1,"Now concerning the matters about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman."
46,7,2,"But because of immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband."
46,7,3,"The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband."
46,7,4,"The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does."
46,7,5,"Do not deprive one another, except by agreement for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."
46,7,6,"I say this by way of concession, not of command."
46,7,7,"I wish that all men were as I myself am. But each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that."
46,7,8,"But I say to the unmarried and to the widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I."
46,7,9,"But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."
46,7,10,"To the married I give charge, not I but the Lord, that the wife should not separate from her husband"
46,7,11,"(but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife."
46,7,12,"But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her."
46,7,13,"If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she must not divorce him."
46,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is they are holy."
46,7,15,"But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him do so; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound. For God has called us to peace."
46,7,16,"For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?"
46,7,17,"Only, let each one lead the life which the Lord has assigned to him, and in which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches."
46,7,18,"Was any man called when he was already circumcised? He is not to become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? He is not to be circumcised."
46,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is what counts."
46,7,20,"Each one should remain in the state in which he was called."
46,7,21,"Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let it trouble youbut if you can gain your freedom, do so."
46,7,22,"For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord's freedman; likewise he who was free when called is Christ's slave."
46,7,23,"You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men."
46,7,24,"Brethren, let each one remain with God in that condition in which he was called."
46,7,25,"Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy."
46,7,26,"I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is."
46,7,27,"Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek marriage."
46,7,28,"But if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have troubles in this flesh, and I am trying to spare you."
46,7,29,"I mean, brethren, the appointed time has grown very short; so that from now on, those who have wives should live as though they had none,"
46,7,30,"and those who mourn, as though they were not mourning; and those who rejoice, as though they were not rejoicing; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;"
46,7,31,"and those who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it. For the form of this world is passing away."
46,7,32,"But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;"
46,7,33,"but a married man is concerned about the affairs of the world, how he may please his wife,"
46,7,34,"and his interests are divided. The unmarried woman, and the virgin, is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but the married woman is concerned about the affairs of the world, how she may please her husband."
46,7,35,"This I say for your own benefit, not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is good and to secure undivided devotion to the Lord."
46,7,36,"But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly toward his betrothed, if she is past her youth, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let them marry."
46,7,37,"But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, but has control over his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well."
46,7,38,"So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who does not marry her will do better."
46,7,39,"A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord."
46,7,40,"But in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God."
46,8,1,"Now concerning food sacrificed to idols: we know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."
46,8,2,"If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know."
46,8,3,"But if anyone loves God, he is known by him."
46,8,4,"Therefore concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one."
46,8,5,"For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many »gods« and many »lords«),"
46,8,6,"yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we exist."
46,8,7,"However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, being accustomed to idols, eat food as really sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled."
46,8,8,"But food will not commend us to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do."
46,8,9,"But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak."
46,8,10,"For if a man sees you, who have knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols?"
46,8,11,"And so by your knowledge this weak man is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died."
46,8,12,"Thus, sinning against your brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ."
46,8,13,"Therefore, if food causes my brother to fall, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to fall."
46,9,1,"Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?"
46,9,2,"If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord."
46,9,3,"This is my defense to those who would examine me."
46,9,4,"Do we not have the right to food and drink?"
46,9,5,"Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife, even as the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?"
46,9,6,"Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?"
46,9,7,"Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk?"
46,9,8,"Do I say this merely from a human point of view? Does not the Law say the same thing?"
46,9,9,"For it is written in the Law of Moses, »You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.« Is it for oxen that God is concerned?"
46,9,10,"Or is he speaking altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the crops."
46,9,11,"If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?"
46,9,12,"If others share this right of support from you, do not we all the more?"
46,9,13,"Do you not know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar?"
46,9,14,"In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living from the gospel."
46,9,15,"But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me. I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my ground for boasting."
46,9,16,"For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for I am under compulsion. For woe is me if I do not preach the gospel!"
46,9,17,"For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if it is not of my will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me."
46,9,18,"What then is my reward? Just this: that in my preaching I may offer the gospel free of charge, and so not make full use of my right in the gospel."
46,9,19,"For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all, that I might win the more."
46,9,20,"To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews; to those under the law I became as one under the lawthough not being myself under the lawso that I might win those under the law."
46,9,21,"To those who are without law, I became as one without law, though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ, so that I might win those who are without the law."
46,9,22,"To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, so that I might by all means save some."
46,9,23,"I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings."
46,9,24,"Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win."
46,9,25,"Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable."
46,9,26,"Therefore I do not run aimlessly. I do not box as a man beating the air."
46,9,27,"But I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified."
46,10,1,"For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea;"
46,10,2,"and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;"
46,10,3,"and all ate the same spiritual food;"
46,10,4,"and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ."
46,10,5,"Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased; for they were overthrown in the wilderness."
46,10,6,"Now these things are examples for us, not to desire evil things as they did."
46,10,7,"Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, »The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play.«"
46,10,8,"We must not indulge in immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day."
46,10,9,"We must not put the Lord to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents."
46,10,10,"Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer."
46,10,11,"Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written down for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come."
46,10,12,"Therefore let any one who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall."
46,10,13,"No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man. And God is faithful, who will not let you be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it."
46,10,14,"Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry."
46,10,15,"I speak as to sensible men; judge for yourselves what I say."
46,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?"
46,10,17,"Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread."
46,10,18,"Consider Israel after the flesh; are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?"
46,10,19,"What do I mean then? That a thing offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?"
46,10,20,"No, but I say that the things pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons."
46,10,21,"You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons."
46,10,22,"Are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?"
46,10,23,"»All things are lawful,« but not all things are helpful. »All things are lawful,« but not all things build up."
46,10,24,"Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor."
46,10,25,"Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience;"
46,10,26,"for, »The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.«"
46,10,27,"If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you want to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising questions of conscience."
46,10,28,"But if anyone says to you, »This has been offered in sacrifice,« then do not eat it, both for the sake of the man who informed you and for conscience' sake"
46,10,29,"the other man's conscience, I mean, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?"
46,10,30,"If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?"
46,10,31,"So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
46,10,32,"Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,"
46,10,33,"just as I try to please all men in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved."
46,11,1,"Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ."
46,11,2,"I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you."
46,11,3,"But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ."
46,11,4,"Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head."
46,11,5,"But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her headit is the same as if her head were shaved."
46,11,6,"For if a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, let her cover her head."
46,11,7,"For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man."
46,11,8,"For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man;"
46,11,9,"neither was man created for woman, but woman for man."
46,11,10,"Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels."
46,11,11,"In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman."
46,11,12,"For as woman was made from man, so also man is born of woman. And all things are from God."
46,11,13,"Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?"
46,11,14,"Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,"
46,11,15,"but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering."
46,11,16,"If anyone wants to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God."
46,11,17,"But in the following instructions, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse."
46,11,18,"For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it."
46,11,19,"For there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized."
46,11,20,"Therefore when you meet together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat,"
46,11,21,"for in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one is hungry and another is drunk."
46,11,22,"What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? No, I will not."
46,11,23,"For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,"
46,11,24,"and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, »This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.«"
46,11,25,"In the same way he took the cup also after supper, saying, »This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.«"
46,11,26,"For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."
46,11,27,"Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord."
46,11,28,"Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup."
46,11,29,"For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself."
46,11,30,"That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep."
46,11,31,"But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged."
46,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world."
46,11,33,"So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another."
46,11,34,"If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come."
46,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be uninformed."
46,12,2,"You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to mute idols, however you may have been moved."
46,12,3,"Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, »Jesus be cursed,« and no one can say, »Jesus is Lord,« except by the Holy Spirit."
46,12,4,"Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit."
46,12,5,"And there are varieties of service, but the same Lord."
46,12,6,"There are varieties of working, but the same God who works all of them in all men."
46,12,7,"But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good."
46,12,8,"To one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit,"
46,12,9,"to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,"
46,12,10,"and to another the working of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another distinguishing between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues."
46,12,11,"But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as he wills."
46,12,12,"For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so it is with Christ."
46,12,13,"For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one bodywhether Jews or Greeks, slaves or freeand we were all made to drink of one Spirit."
46,12,14,"For the body is not made up of one member but of many."
46,12,15,"If the foot should say, »Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,« it would not for that reason be any less a part of the body."
46,12,16,"And if the ear should say, »Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,« it would not for that reason be any less a part of the body."
46,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?"
46,12,18,"But now God has arranged the members in the body, each one of them, just as he desired."
46,12,19,"If they were all one member, where would the body be?"
46,12,20,"As it is, there are many parts, but one body."
46,12,21,"And the eye cannot say to the hand, »I have no need of you,« nor again the head to the feet, »I have no need of you.«"
46,12,22,"On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,"
46,12,23,"and those parts of the body which we think less honorable we treat with the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,"
46,12,24,"while our more presentable members have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving the greater honor to the parts that lacked it,"
46,12,25,"so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another."
46,12,26,"And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it."
46,12,27,"Now you are the body of Christ, and individually members of it."
46,12,28,"And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, then those having gifts of healings, helps, administrations, and those speaking in various kinds of tongues."
46,12,29,"Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?"
46,12,30,"Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?"
46,12,31,"But earnestly desire the greater gifts."
46,13,1,"If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal."
46,13,2,"If I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing."
46,13,3,"If I give all I have to the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing."
46,13,4,"Love is patient, love is kind. It is not jealous or boastful, it is not arrogant"
46,13,5,"or rude, it does not seek its own, it is not provoked, it keeps no record of wrongs,"
46,13,6,"it does not rejoice in evil, but rejoices with the truth."
46,13,7,"Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."
46,13,8,"Love never fails; but where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away."
46,13,9,"For we know in part and we prophesy in part;"
46,13,10,"but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away."
46,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I put childish ways behind me."
46,13,12,"For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know fullyeven as I have been fully known."
46,13,13,"So now faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love."
46,14,1,"Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy."
46,14,2,"For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one understands him, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries."
46,14,3,"But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their edification and encouragement and comfort."
46,14,4,"He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church."
46,14,5,"Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless some one interprets, so that the church may be edified."
46,14,6,"But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?"
46,14,7,"If even lifeless things, such as the flute or the harp, do not give a distinction in the notes, how will any one know what is played?"
46,14,8,"And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?"
46,14,9,"So it is with you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is intelligible, how will anyone know what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air."
46,14,10,"Undoubtedly there are many languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning."
46,14,11,"If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the one who is speaking, and the speaker will be a foreigner to me."
46,14,12,"So it is with you; since you are eager for spiritual gifts, strive to excel in building up the church."
46,14,13,"Therefore, he who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret."
46,14,14,"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful."
46,14,15,"What am I to do? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also."
46,14,16,"Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how can any one in the position of an outsider say the »Amen« to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?"
46,14,17,"For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified."
46,14,18,"I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all;"
46,14,19,"but in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue."
46,14,20,"Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; be infants in evil, but in thinking be mature."
46,14,21,"In the law it is written,"
46,14,22,"Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; but prophecy is for believers, not for unbelievers."
46,14,23,"Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?"
46,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all;"
46,14,25,"the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so, he will fall on his face, and worship God, declaring that God is really among you."
46,14,26,"What is the outcome then, brethren? When you come together, each one has a hymn, or a teaching, or a revelation, or a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification."
46,14,27,"If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn; and one must interpret."
46,14,28,"But if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God."
46,14,29,"Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said."
46,14,30,"But if a revelation is made to another who is sitting, the first one must keep silent."
46,14,31,"For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged;"
46,14,32,"and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets."
46,14,33,"For God is not a God of confusion but of peace."
46,14,34,"the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be submissive, as even the law says."
46,14,35,"If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church."
46,14,36,"Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?"
46,14,37,"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command."
46,14,38,"But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized."
46,14,39,"Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues."
46,14,40,"But all things should be done decently and in an orderly way."
46,15,1,"Now I would remind you, brethren, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand,"
46,15,2,"by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain."
46,15,3,"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,"
46,15,4,"that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,"
46,15,5,"and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve."
46,15,6,"After that he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep."
46,15,7,"Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles."
46,15,8,"And last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared to me also."
46,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
46,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. No, I worked harder than all of themyet not I, but the grace of God that was with me."
46,15,11,"Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed."
46,15,12,"Now if Christ is preached that he has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
46,15,13,"But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised;"
46,15,14,"if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and so is your faith."
46,15,15,"More than that, we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised."
46,15,16,"For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised."
46,15,17,"And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins."
46,15,18,"Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished."
46,15,19,"If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied."
46,15,20,"But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep."
46,15,21,"For since by a man came death, by a man came also the resurrection of the dead."
46,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive."
46,15,23,"But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then, at his coming, those who belong to him."
46,15,24,"Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all rule and all authority and power."
46,15,25,"For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet."
46,15,26,"The last enemy to be destroyed is death."
46,15,27,"»For God has put all things in subjection under his feet.« But when it says, »All things are put in subjection under him,« it is plain that he is excepted who put all things under him."
46,15,28,"When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things under him, that God may be all in all."
46,15,29,"Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are people baptized for them?"
46,15,30,"Why are we also in danger every hour?"
46,15,31,"I protest, brethren, by my pride in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day."
46,15,32,"If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised,"
46,15,33,"Do not be deceived:"
46,15,34,"Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame."
46,15,35,"But someone will ask, »How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?«"
46,15,36,"You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies."
46,15,37,"And that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else."
46,15,38,"But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body."
46,15,39,"For not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of birds, and another of fish."
46,15,40,"There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another."
46,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory."
46,15,42,"So is it with the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable body, it is raised imperishable;"
46,15,43,"it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;"
46,15,44,"it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body."
46,15,45,"So it is written, »The first man Adam became a living being«; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit."
46,15,46,"However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; and then the spiritual."
46,15,47,"The first man was from the earth, of dust; the second man is from heaven."
46,15,48,"As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven."
46,15,49,"Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven."
46,15,50,"Now I tell you this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable."
46,15,51,"Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,"
46,15,52,"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed."
46,15,53,"For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality."
46,15,54,"When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then will come to pass the saying that is written:"
46,15,55,""
46,15,56,"The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law."
46,15,57,"But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
46,15,58,"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord."
46,16,1,"Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you must also do."
46,16,2,"On the first day of every week, each one of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come."
46,16,3,"And when I arrive, I will send those whom you approve with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem."
46,16,4,"If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me."
46,16,5,"But I will come to you after I go through Macedonia, for I am going through Macedonia;"
46,16,6,"and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may help me on my journey, wherever I go."
46,16,7,"For I do not want to see you now just in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits."
46,16,8,"But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,"
46,16,9,"for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries."
46,16,10,"Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you with nothing to fear, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am."
46,16,11,"So let no one despise him. Send him on his way in peace, that he may return to me; for I am expecting him with the brethren."
46,16,12,"As for our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the other brethren, but it was not at all his will to come now. He will come when he has opportunity."
46,16,13,"Be on the your guard, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong."
46,16,14,"Let all that you do be done in love."
46,16,15,"You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. Now I urge you, brethren,"
46,16,16,"to be subject to such men and to everyone who helps in the work and labors."
46,16,17,"I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking on your part."
46,16,18,"For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Give recognition to such men."
46,16,19,"The churches of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the lord, with the church that is in their house."
46,16,20,"All the brethren send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss."
46,16,21,"I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand."
46,16,22,"If anyone does not love the Lordlet him be accursed. Come, O Lord!"
46,16,23,"The grace of The Lord Jesus be with you."
46,16,24,"My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen."
47,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are throughout Achaia:"
47,1,2,"grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
47,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort,"
47,1,4,"who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God."
47,1,5,"For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows."
47,1,6,"If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings that we suffer."
47,1,7,"And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort."
47,1,8,"For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life."
47,1,9,"Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead."
47,1,10,"He delivered us from so deadly a peril, and he will deliver us; on him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again."
47,1,11,"You also must help us by your prayers, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to the prayers of many."
47,1,12,"For our boast is this: the testimony of our conscience, that with holiness and godly sincerity, not in worldly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and still more toward you."
47,1,13,"For we write you nothing but what you can read and understand; and I hope you will understand fully,"
47,1,14,"as you have understood us in part, that you can be proud of us just as we can be of you, in the day of the Lord Jesus."
47,1,15,"Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a double benefit."
47,1,16,"I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea."
47,1,17,"When I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a fleshly manner so that in the same breath I say, »Yes, Yes« and »No, No«?"
47,1,18,"But as surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No."
47,1,19,"For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you by usby me and Silvanus and Timothywas not Yes and No, but in him it has always been Yes."
47,1,20,"For as many as are the promises of God, in him they are Yes. And so through him we speak our Amen to the glory of God."
47,1,21,"Now it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us;"
47,1,22,"he has put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee."
47,1,23,"But I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth."
47,1,24,"Not that we lord it over your faith; but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith."
47,2,1,"So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you."
47,2,2,"For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?"
47,2,3,"And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I had confidence in all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all."
47,2,4,"For I wrote you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you."
47,2,5,"But if any one has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measurenot to put it too severelyto all of you."
47,2,6,"Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the majority,"
47,2,7,"so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow."
47,2,8,"I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him."
47,2,9,"For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything."
47,2,10,"Any one whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ,"
47,2,11,"in order that Satan might gain no advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his schemes."
47,2,12,"Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord,"
47,2,13,"I still had no rest in my mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took my leave of them and went on to Macedonia."
47,2,14,"But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere."
47,2,15,"For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing,"
47,2,16,"to the one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?"
47,2,17,"For we are not, like so many, peddling the word of God; but as men of sincerity, as from God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ."
47,3,1,"Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you?"
47,3,2,"You yourselves are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men."
47,3,3,"You show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of carnal hearts."
47,3,4,"Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God."
47,3,5,"Not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as coming from ourselves; but our competence is from God,"
47,3,6,"who has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."
47,3,7,"Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,"
47,3,8,"will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?"
47,3,9,"For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness exceed it in glory."
47,3,10,"For indeed what had glory, in this case has no glory because of the glory that surpasses it."
47,3,11,"For if what was fading away came with glory, much more is the glory of that which lasts."
47,3,12,"Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold."
47,3,13,"We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at the end of the radiance that was fading away."
47,3,14,"But their minds were hardened; for to this day, when they read the old covenant, the same veil remains unlifted, because only in Christ is it removed."
47,3,15,"Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts."
47,3,16,"But whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away."
47,3,17,"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."
47,3,18,"And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness from one degree of glory to another, for this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."
47,4,1,"Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart."
47,4,2,"But we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."
47,4,3,"And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing."
47,4,4,"In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."
47,4,5,"For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake."
47,4,6,"For it is the God who said, »Let light shine out of darkness,« who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ."
47,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us."
47,4,8,"We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;"
47,4,9,"persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;"
47,4,10,"always carrying about in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body."
47,4,11,"For we who live are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh."
47,4,12,"So then death is at work in us, but life in you."
47,4,13,"Since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, »I believed and therefore I spoke,« we also believe and therefore speak,"
47,4,14,"knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence."
47,4,15,"For all this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God."
47,4,16,"Therefore we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away, yet our inner nature is being renewed day by day."
47,4,17,"For our light and momentary affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,"
47,4,18,"while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are unseen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are unseen are eternal."
47,5,1,"For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
47,5,2,"Here indeed we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,"
47,5,3,"so that when we are clothed, we will not be found naked."
47,5,4,"For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed, but to be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life."
47,5,5,"Now he who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee."
47,5,6,"Therefore we are always of good courage; and we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord,"
47,5,7,"for we walk by faith, not by sight."
47,5,8,"We are confident, I say, and would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord."
47,5,9,"So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him."
47,5,10,"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad."
47,5,11,"Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience."
47,5,12,"We are not again commending ourselves to you, but are giving you an occasion to be proud of us, so that you may have an answer for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart."
47,5,13,"For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you."
47,5,14,"For the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore all have died."
47,5,15,"And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again."
47,5,16,"From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a fleshly point of view; even though we once regarded Christ from a fleshly point of view, we regard him thus no longer."
47,5,17,"Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the new has come."
47,5,18,"All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation;"
47,5,19,"that is, God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation."
47,5,20,"We are therefore ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making his appeal through us. We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God."
47,5,21,"For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
47,6,1,"Working together with him, then, we urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain."
47,6,2,"For he says,"
47,6,3,"We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited."
47,6,4,"But as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, distresses,"
47,6,5,"in beatings, imprisonments, tumults, labors, sleeplessness, hunger,"
47,6,6,"in purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love,"
47,6,7,"in truthful speech, and in the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left;"
47,6,8,"through glory and dishonor, evil report and good report; true, yet regarded as impostors;"
47,6,9,"as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as punished, and yet not killed;"
47,6,10,"as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing everything."
47,6,11,"Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians. Our heart is opened wide."
47,6,12,"You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections."
47,6,13,"Now in a fair exchangeI speak as to my childrenopen wide your hearts also."
47,6,14,"Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?"
47,6,15,"What harmony has Christ with Belial? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?"
47,6,16,"What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said,"
47,6,17,""
47,6,18,""
47,7,1,"Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
47,7,2,"Make room for us in your hearts; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one."
47,7,3,"I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together."
47,7,4,"I have great confidence in you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. With all our affliction, I am overflowing with joy."
47,7,5,"For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted at every turnconflicts on the outside and fears within."
47,7,6,"But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,"
47,7,7,"and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more."
47,7,8,"For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret itfor I see that my letter hurt you, though only for a little while"
47,7,9,"now I rejoice, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance; for you became sorrowful as God intended, so that you suffered no loss through us."
47,7,10,"For godly sorrow produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret, but worldly sorrow produces death."
47,7,11,"For behold what this very thing, godly sorrow, has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal, what readiness to see justice done! At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter."
47,7,12,"So although I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your zeal for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God."
47,7,13,"Therefore we are comforted."
47,7,14,"For if I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame; but just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting before Titus has proved true."
47,7,15,"And his affection goes out all the more to you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling."
47,7,16,"I rejoice, because I have perfect confidence in you."
47,8,1,"Now, brethren, we want you to know about the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,"
47,8,2,"for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in the wealth of their liberality."
47,8,3,"For I testify that according to their ability, and even beyond their ability, they gave of their own free will,"
47,8,4,"urgently pleading with us for the privilege of sharing in the relief of the saints."
47,8,5,"And they did not do as we expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God."
47,8,6,"So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning, he would also complete in you this work of grace."
47,8,7,"But as you excel in everythingin faith, in utterance, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in your love for ussee that you excel in this work of grace also."
47,8,8,"I am not speaking this as a command, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others."
47,8,9,"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that through his poverty you might become rich."
47,8,10,"And in this matter I give my advice: it is best for you now to complete what a year ago you began not only to do but to desire."
47,8,11,"Now finish the work, so that your readiness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means."
47,8,12,"For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to what he does not have."
47,8,13,"For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened;"
47,8,14,"but at the present time your abundance should supply their need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be equality."
47,8,15,"As it is written,"
47,8,16,"But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus."
47,8,17,"For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord."
47,8,18,"And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his preaching of the gospel;"
47,8,19,"and not only that, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work which we are carrying on, for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will."
47,8,20,"We intend that no one should blame us about this liberal gift which we are administering,"
47,8,21,"for we have regard for what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
47,8,22,"And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many matters, but who is now more diligent than ever because of his great confidence in you."
47,8,23,"As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; and as for our brethren, they are messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ."
47,8,24,"Therefore openly before the churches, show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our boasting about you."
47,9,1,"Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the offering for the saints,"
47,9,2,"for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year; and your zeal has stirred up most of them."
47,9,3,"But I am sending the brethren so that our boasting about you may not prove vain in this case, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be;"
47,9,4,"lest if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, wenot to say anything about youwould be ashamed of having been so confident."
47,9,5,"So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren to go on to you before me, and arrange in advance for this gift you have promised, so that it may be ready not as an exaction but as a willing gift."
47,9,6,"The point is this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully."
47,9,7,"Each one must give just as he has purposed in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver."
47,9,8,"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, so that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may have an abundance for every good work."
47,9,9,"As it is written,"
47,9,10,"Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will multiply the harvest of your righteousness."
47,9,11,"You will be enriched in every way for great generosity, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God."
47,9,12,"For the ministry of this service is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God."
47,9,13,"Because of the test of this service, you will glorify God by your obedience in your confession of the gospel of Christ, and by the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others;"
47,9,14,"while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God in you."
47,9,15,"Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!"
47,10,1,"I, Paul, myself urge you, by the meekness and gentleness of ChristI who am humble when face to face with you, but bold to you when I am away!"
47,10,2,"I beg you that when I am present I may not have to be bold with that confidence by which I intend to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh."
47,10,3,"For though we live in the flesh, we do not wage war as the flesh does."
47,10,4,"For the weapons of our warfare are not the weapons of the world, but they have divine power to destroy strongholds."
47,10,5,"We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ,"
47,10,6,"and we are ready to punish every disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete."
47,10,7,"You look at things as they are outwardly. If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christs, so also are we."
47,10,8,"For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I shall not be put to shame."
47,10,9,"I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters."
47,10,10,"For they say, »His letters are weighty and strong, but his personal presence is weak, and his speech of no account.«"
47,10,11,"Let such people realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present."
47,10,12,"For we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding."
47,10,13,"But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the field God has apportioned to us, a field that reaches even to you."
47,10,14,"For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach to you; we were the first to come even as far as you with the gospel of Christ."
47,10,15,"We do not go beyond limits by boasting in other mens labors, but our hope is that as your faith grows, our sphere among you may be greatly enlarged,"
47,10,16,"so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast of work already done in another man's territory."
47,10,17,"But, »Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.«"
47,10,18,"For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he whom the Lord commends."
47,11,1,"I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness; but indeed you are bearing with me."
47,11,2,"I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I betrothed you to one husband, so that to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin."
47,11,3,"But I am afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ."
47,11,4,"For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the one we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough."
47,11,5,"I think that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles."
47,11,6,"But even if I am unskilled in speech, I am not in knowledge; in every way we have made this plain to you in all things."
47,11,7,"Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?"
47,11,8,"I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you."
47,11,9,"And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so."
47,11,10,"As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia."
47,11,11,"Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!"
47,11,12,"And what I am doing, I will also continue to do, in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things of which they boast."
47,11,13,"For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ."
47,11,14,"And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light."
47,11,15,"Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will be according to their deeds."
47,11,16,"I repeat, let no one think me foolish; but even if you do, receive me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little."
47,11,17,"What I am saying I am not saying as the Lord would, but as a fool, in this confidence of boasting."
47,11,18,"Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast."
47,11,19,"For you put up with fools gladly, being so wise yourselves!"
47,11,20,"For you put up with anyone if he makes slaves of you, or preys upon you, or takes advantage of you, or exalts himself, or strikes you in the face."
47,11,21,"To my shame, I must say that we were too weak for that! But whatever anyone else dares to boast aboutI am speaking as a foolI also dare to boast about."
47,11,22,"Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I."
47,11,23,"Are they servants of Christ? I am a better oneI am talking like a madmanin far more labors, in far more imprisonments, with more beatings, and often in danger of death."
47,11,24,"Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one."
47,11,25,"Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the open sea."
47,11,26,"I have been on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, in danger from robbers, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles, in danger in the city, in danger in the wilderness, in danger at sea, and in danger from false brethren;"
47,11,27,"I have been in labor and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure."
47,11,28,"Besides such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches."
47,11,29,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I do not inwardly burn?"
47,11,30,"If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness."
47,11,31,"The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying."
47,11,32,"In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me,"
47,11,33,"but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped his hands."
47,12,1,"I must go on boasting, though there is nothing to be gained by it; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord."
47,12,2,"I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not knowGod knows."
47,12,3,"And I know that this manwhether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows"
47,12,4,"was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, which a man is not permitted to tell."
47,12,5,"On behalf of such a man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses."
47,12,6,"Though if I should boast, I will not be a fool, for I will be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me."
47,12,7,"And to keep me from being too elated because of the abundance of revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated."
47,12,8,"Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should depart from me."
47,12,9,"But he said to me, »My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.« Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest on me."
47,12,10,"That is why, for Christ's sake, I am content in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties; for when I am weak, then I am strong."
47,12,11,"I have been a fool! You forced me to it, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I was not in the least inferior to these super-apostles, even though I am nothing."
47,12,12,"The signs of a true apostle were performed among you in all perseverance, with signs and wonders and mighty works."
47,12,13,"For in what respect were you inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not become a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!"
47,12,14,"Here for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden to you, for I seek not what is yours but you; for children ought not to lay up for their parents, but parents for their children."
47,12,15,"I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you the more, am I to be loved the less?"
47,12,16,"But be that as it may, I did not burden you myself. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery!"
47,12,17,"Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you?"
47,12,18,"I urged Titus to go, and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? Did we not act in the same spirit and walk in the same steps?"
47,12,19,"Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves before you? It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ, and all for your upbuilding, beloved."
47,12,20,"For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you what I wish you to be, and you may not find me what you wish me to be; I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder."
47,12,21,"I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will have to mourn over many of those who sinned before and have not repented of the impurity, immorality, and lewdness which they have practiced."
47,13,1,"This is the third time I am coming to you. Every charge must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses."
47,13,2,"I warned those who sinned in the past and all the others, and I warn them now while absent, as I did when present the second time, that if I come again I will not spare them"
47,13,3,"since you desire proof that Christ is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful in you."
47,13,4,"For he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God for you."
47,13,5,"Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in youunless, indeed, you fail the test?"
47,13,6,"I trust that you will realize that we have not failed the test."
47,13,7,"Now we pray to God that you may not do wrongnot that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may seem to have failed."
47,13,8,"For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth."
47,13,9,"For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. What we pray for is your perfection."
47,13,10,"I write these things while I am absent, in order that when I come I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority which the Lord gave me for building you up, and not for tearing you down."
47,13,11,"Finally, brethren, farewell. Aim for perfection, listen to my appeal, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you."
47,13,12,"Greet one another with a holy kiss."
47,13,13,"All the saints greet you."
47,13,14,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."
48,1,1,"Paul, an apostlesent not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead"
48,1,2,"and all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:"
48,1,3,"grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,"
48,1,4,"who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,"
48,1,5,"to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen."
48,1,6,"I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel"
48,1,7,"which is really not another gospel; but there are some who are disturbing you, and want to pervert the gospel of Christ."
48,1,8,"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we preached to you, let him be accursed!"
48,1,9,"As we have said before, so I say again now, if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be accursed!"
48,1,10,"Am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ."
48,1,11,"For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man."
48,1,12,"For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ."
48,1,13,"For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it;"
48,1,14,"and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers."
48,1,15,"But when God, who had set me apart even from my mother's womb and called me through his grace, was pleased"
48,1,16,"to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,"
48,1,17,"nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus."
48,1,18,"Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days."
48,1,19,"But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother."
48,1,20,"(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I do not lie.)"
48,1,21,"Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia."
48,1,22,"I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ;"
48,1,23,"they only heard it said, »He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.«"
48,1,24,"And they glorified God because of me."
48,2,1,"Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also."
48,2,2,"I went up because of a revelation; and I set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did this privately to those who were of reputation, for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain."
48,2,3,"But even Titus, who was with me, was not compelled to be circumcised, though he was a Greek."
48,2,4,"But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in, who had slipped in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage."
48,2,5,"We did not yield to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you."
48,2,6,"And from those who were reputed to be something (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)those, I say, who were of repute added nothing to me;"
48,2,7,"but on the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised"
48,2,8,"(for he who effectually worked for Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised effectually worked for me also to the Gentiles),"
48,2,9,"and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised."
48,2,10,"All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do."
48,2,11,"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned."
48,2,12,"For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to draw back and separate himself, fearing the party of the circumcision."
48,2,13,"The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy."
48,2,14,"But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of them all, »If you, being a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?"
48,2,15,"»We ourselves, who are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners,"
48,2,16,"yet who know that a man is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ, and not by works of the law, because by works of the law will no flesh be justified."
48,2,17,"But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have also been found sinners, is Christ then an agent of sin? Certainly not!"
48,2,18,"For if I rebuild what I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor."
48,2,19,"For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God."
48,2,20,"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
48,2,21,"I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died for nothing.«"
48,3,1,"You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?"
48,3,2,"This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?"
48,3,3,"Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?"
48,3,4,"Did you suffer so many things in vainif it really was in vain?"
48,3,5,"Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?"
48,3,6,"Even so Abraham »believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.«"
48,3,7,"Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham."
48,3,8,"And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, »In you will all the nations be blessed.«"
48,3,9,"So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the man of faith."
48,3,10,"For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, »Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, to do them.«"
48,3,11,"Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, »The righteous man shall live by faith.«"
48,3,12,"But the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, »He who does them shall live by them.«"
48,3,13,"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for usfor it is written, »Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree«"
48,3,14,"in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
48,3,15,"To give a human example, brethren: even though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it."
48,3,16,"Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, »And to seeds,« as referring to many, but rather to one, »And to your seed,« that is, Christ."
48,3,17,"What I mean is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise."
48,3,18,"For if the inheritance is based on the law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise."
48,3,19,"Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made."
48,3,20,"Now a mediator does not represent just one party; but God is one."
48,3,21,"Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given which could impart life, then righteousness would indeed have come by the law."
48,3,22,"But the Scripture has bound everyone under sin, so that that what was promised by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."
48,3,23,"Now before faith came, we were bound under the law, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed."
48,3,24,"So the law was our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith."
48,3,25,"But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor."
48,3,26,"For you are all sons of God, through faith in Christ Jesus."
48,3,27,"For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ."
48,3,28,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
48,3,29,"And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise."
48,4,1,"I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, although he is the owner of all the estate;"
48,4,2,"but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father."
48,4,3,"So also, when we were children, we were in slavery under the elemental things of the world."
48,4,4,"But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,"
48,4,5,"to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons."
48,4,6,"Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, »Abba! Father!«"
48,4,7,"So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God."
48,4,8,"Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods."
48,4,9,"But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things? Do you desire to be enslaved all over again?"
48,4,10,"You observe days and months and seasons and years!"
48,4,11,"I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain."
48,4,12,"Brethren, I beg you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong;"
48,4,13,"you know it was because of an illness in the flesh that I preached the gospel to you at first;"
48,4,14,"and though my fleshly condition was a trial to you, you did not despise or scorn me, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus himself."
48,4,15,"What has become of the satisfaction you felt? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me."
48,4,16,"Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?"
48,4,17,"They seek you, but for no good purpose; they want to shut you out, so that you may seek them."
48,4,18,"But it is always good to seek a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you."
48,4,19,"My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you"
48,4,20,"I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you."
48,4,21,"Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law?"
48,4,22,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave and one by the free woman."
48,4,23,"But the son by the slave was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise."
48,4,24,"This is allegorically speaking, for these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar."
48,4,25,"Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children."
48,4,26,"But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother."
48,4,27,"For it is written,"
48,4,28,"Now you, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise."
48,4,29,"But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now."
48,4,30,"But what does the scripture say? »Cast out the slave and her son, for the son of the slave shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.«"
48,4,31,"So then, brethren, we are not children of the slave, but of the free woman."
48,5,1,"It was for freedom that Christ has set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery."
48,5,2,"Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you."
48,5,3,"I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law."
48,5,4,"You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen away from grace."
48,5,5,"For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait for the hope of righteousness."
48,5,6,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working through love."
48,5,7,"You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?"
48,5,8,"This persuasion did not come from him who calls you."
48,5,9,"A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough."
48,5,10,"I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view than mine; and the one who is troubling you will bear his judgment, whoever he is."
48,5,11,"But if I, brethren, still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished."
48,5,12,"I wish that those who are troubling you would mutilate themselves!"
48,5,13,"For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another."
48,5,14,"For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself.«"
48,5,15,"But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another."
48,5,16,"But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."
48,5,17,"For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do what you would."
48,5,18,"But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law."
48,5,19,"Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, lewdness,"
48,5,20,"idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,"
48,5,21,"envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."
48,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,"
48,5,23,"gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law."
48,5,24,"Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires."
48,5,25,"If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit."
48,5,26,"Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another."
48,6,1,"Brethren, even if anyone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted."
48,6,2,"Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ."
48,6,3,"For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
48,6,4,"But let each one test his own work, and then he will have reason to boast in himself alone, and not in his neighbor."
48,6,5,"For each one will bear his own load."
48,6,6,"Let the one who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches."
48,6,7,"Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap."
48,6,8,"For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption; but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life."
48,6,9,"Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary."
48,6,10,"So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of faith."
48,6,11,"See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand."
48,6,12,"Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ."
48,6,13,"For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh."
48,6,14,"But may it never be that I would boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world."
48,6,15,"For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but what counts is a new creation."
48,6,16,"Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule, upon the Israel of God."
48,6,17,"From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus."
48,6,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen."
49,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus and faithful in Christ Jesus:"
49,1,2,"grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
49,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,"
49,1,4,"just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before him. In love"
49,1,5,"he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,"
49,1,6,"to the praise of his glorious grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved."
49,1,7,"In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace"
49,1,8,"which he lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight"
49,1,9,"he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ,"
49,1,10,"as a plan for the fullness of the times, to unite all things in Christ, things in heaven and things on earth. In him"
49,1,11,"also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will,"
49,1,12,"in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, would be for the praise of his glory."
49,1,13,"In him, you also have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having also believed, you were sealed in him with the promised Holy Spirit,"
49,1,14,"who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance, until the redemption of those who are God's possessionto the praise of his glory."
49,1,15,"For this reason, ever since I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,"
49,1,16,"I do not cease giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,"
49,1,17,"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him."
49,1,18,"I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints,"
49,1,19,"and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of his might"
49,1,20,"which he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,"
49,1,21,"far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come."
49,1,22,"And he put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things for the church,"
49,1,23,"which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all."
49,2,1,"And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,"
49,2,2,"in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience."
49,2,3,"Among them we all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, following the desires of flesh and mind, and so we were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind."
49,2,4,"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us,"
49,2,5,"even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),"
49,2,6,"and raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,"
49,2,7,"so that in the coming ages he might show the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus."
49,2,8,"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God"
49,2,9,"not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."
49,2,10,"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we would walk in them."
49,2,11,"Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called »Uncircumcision« by the so-called »Circumcision,« which is performed in the flesh by human hands"
49,2,12,"remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world."
49,2,13,"But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ."
49,2,14,"For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,"
49,2,15,"by abolishing in his flesh the hostility, which is the Law of commandments and ordinances, so that he might create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace,"
49,2,16,"and might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, by which he put to death the hostility."
49,2,17,"And he came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near;"
49,2,18,"for through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father."
49,2,19,"So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are members of God's household,"
49,2,20,"having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone,"
49,2,21,"in whom the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord;"
49,2,22,"in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit."
49,3,1,"For this reason I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles"
49,3,2,"assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you,"
49,3,3,"that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly."
49,3,4,"When you read this, you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,"
49,3,5,"which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;"
49,3,6,"that is, how the Gentiles are fellow heirs and members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel."
49,3,7,"Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace which was given me by the working of his power."
49,3,8,"To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,"
49,3,9,"and to make plain to everyone the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;"
49,3,10,"so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places."
49,3,11,"This was according to the eternal purpose which he carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,"
49,3,12,"in whom we have boldness and confidence of access through our faith in him."
49,3,13,"Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations for you, which are your glory."
49,3,14,"For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,"
49,3,15,"from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,"
49,3,16,"that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner man,"
49,3,17,"so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,"
49,3,18,"may have power to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,"
49,3,19,"and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God."
49,3,20,"Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,"
49,3,21,"to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever and ever. Amen."
49,4,1,"I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called,"
49,4,2,"with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,"
49,4,3,"being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
49,4,4,"There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call,"
49,4,5,"one Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
49,4,6,"one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
49,4,7,"But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift."
49,4,8,"Therefore it says,"
49,4,9,"(In saying, »He ascended,« what does it mean except that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth?"
49,4,10,"He who descended is also he who ascended far above all the heavens, so that he might fill all things.)"
49,4,11,"And he gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers,"
49,4,12,"to equip the saints for the work of service, for the building up of the body of Christ;"
49,4,13,"until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to become mature, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
49,4,14,"As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming."
49,4,15,"But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into him, who is the head, into Christ,"
49,4,16,"from whom the whole body, being joined and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each part, causes the growth of the body and builds itself up in love."
49,4,17,"Now this I affirm and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds,"
49,4,18,"they are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to the hardness of their heart;"
49,4,19,"and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality, greedy for the practice of every kind of impurity."
49,4,20,"But you did not learn Christ in this way,"
49,4,21,"assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus."
49,4,22,"You were taught, with regard to your former manner of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful lusts;"
49,4,23,"and be renewed in the spirit of your minds,"
49,4,24,"and put on the new nature, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness."
49,4,25,"Therefore, laying aside falsehood, each one of you must speak truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another."
49,4,26,"Be angry, and yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,"
49,4,27,"and do not give the devil an opportunity."
49,4,28,"He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but rather must labor, doing useful work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with those in need."
49,4,29,"Let no unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building others up according to the need of the moment, that it may impart grace to those who hear."
49,4,30,"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."
49,4,31,"Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice."
49,4,32,"Be kind and tenderhearted to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."
49,5,1,"Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;"
49,5,2,"and walk in love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God."
49,5,3,"But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints."
49,5,4,"And there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather let there be thanksgiving."
49,5,5,"For of this you can be sure, that no immoral, impure, or covetous personsuch a man is an idolaterhas any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
49,5,6,"Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience."
49,5,7,"Therefore do not be partners with them;"
49,5,8,"for once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light"
49,5,9,"(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth),"
49,5,10,"and try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord."
49,5,11,"Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead expose them."
49,5,12,"For it is a shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret."
49,5,13,"But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light."
49,5,14,"For this reason it is said,"
49,5,15,"Be careful, then, how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise,"
49,5,16,"making the most of your time, because the days are evil."
49,5,17,"Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is."
49,5,18,"And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit,"
49,5,19,"speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord,"
49,5,20,"always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
49,5,21,"Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ."
49,5,22,"Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord."
49,5,23,"For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is himself the Savior."
49,5,24,"As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject to their husbands in everything."
49,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,"
49,5,26,"that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,"
49,5,27,"that he might present the church to himself in all her glory, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and blameless."
49,5,28,"So husbands ought also to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself."
49,5,29,"For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,"
49,5,30,"because we are members of his body."
49,5,31,"»For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.«"
49,5,32,"This is a profound mystery; but I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church."
49,5,33,"However, each one of you must also love his wife as himself, and the wife must see that she respects her husband."
49,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."
49,6,2,"»Honor your father and mother« (which is the first commandment with a promise),"
49,6,3,"»that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.«"
49,6,4,"Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."
49,6,5,"Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ;"
49,6,6,"not in the way of eye-service, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart."
49,6,7,"Render service with good will, as to the Lord, and not to men,"
49,6,8,"knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free."
49,6,9,"Masters, do the same to them, and give up threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him."
49,6,10,"Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might."
49,6,11,"Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil."
49,6,12,"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places."
49,6,13,"Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm."
49,6,14,"Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,"
49,6,15,"and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;"
49,6,16,"in addition to all this, taking up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one."
49,6,17,"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God."
49,6,18,"Pray at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and petition. And with this in view, keep alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints,"
49,6,19,"and also pray for me, that in the opening of my mouth, utterance may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,"
49,6,20,"for which I am an ambassador in chains; that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak."
49,6,21,"Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing."
49,6,22,"I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage your hearts."
49,6,23,"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
49,6,24,"Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love."
50,1,1,"Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:"
50,1,2,"grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
50,1,3,"I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,"
50,1,4,"always making my prayer with joy in every prayer of mine for you all,"
50,1,5,"because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now."
50,1,6,"For I am confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus."
50,1,7,"For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me."
50,1,8,"For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus."
50,1,9,"And this is my prayer, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,"
50,1,10,"so that you may approve what is excellent, and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ;"
50,1,11,"having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God."
50,1,12,"Now I want you to know, brethren, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel,"
50,1,13,"so that my imprisonment for Christ has become well known throughout the whole praetorian guard and to everyone else,"
50,1,14,"and that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have been encouraged to speak the word of God without fear."
50,1,15,"Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will."
50,1,16,"The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel;"
50,1,17,"the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, but thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment."
50,1,18,"What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,"
50,1,19,"for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance,"
50,1,20,"as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be ashamed in anything, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death."
50,1,21,"For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain."
50,1,22,"But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I do not know."
50,1,23,"I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better;"
50,1,24,"but to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake."
50,1,25,"Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,"
50,1,26,"so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again."
50,1,27,"Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you stand firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,"
50,1,28,"in no way frightened by your opponents. This is a sign of destruction to them, but of salvation for you  and that too, from God."
50,1,29,"For to you it has been granted for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake,"
50,1,30,"having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me."
50,2,1,"Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,"
50,2,2,"make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose."
50,2,3,"Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves."
50,2,4,"Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others."
50,2,5,"Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,"
50,2,6,"who, though he was in the form of God, did not consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,"
50,2,7,"but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men."
50,2,8,"And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to deatheven death on a cross."
50,2,9,"Therefore God also highly exalted him, and bestowed on him the name which is above every name,"
50,2,10,"that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,"
50,2,11,"and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
50,2,12,"Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling;"
50,2,13,"for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."
50,2,14,"Do all things without grumbling or arguing,"
50,2,15,"so that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,"
50,2,16,"holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain."
50,2,17,"But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all."
50,2,18,"So you too should be glad and rejoice with me."
50,2,19,"I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news of you."
50,2,20,"I have no one else like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare."
50,2,21,"For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus."
50,2,22,"But you know that he has proved his worth, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel."
50,2,23,"Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me;"
50,2,24,"and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also."
50,2,25,"But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need;"
50,2,26,"for he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was ill."
50,2,27,"Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow."
50,2,28,"Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may have less anxiety."
50,2,29,"So receive him in the Lord with all joy; and honor men like him,"
50,2,30,"because he almost died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me."
50,3,1,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you."
50,3,2,"Watch out for the dogs, watch out for the evil workers, watch out for those mutilators of the body."
50,3,3,"For we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh,"
50,3,4,"though I myself have reasons for confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:"
50,3,5,"circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;"
50,3,6,"as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless."
50,3,7,"But whatever was gain to me, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ."
50,3,8,"More than that, I count everything to be loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ"
50,3,9,"and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christthe righteousness that comes from God and is by faith,"
50,3,10,"that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming like him in his death;"
50,3,11,"in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead."
50,3,12,"Not that I have already obtained this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me."
50,3,13,"Brethren, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,"
50,3,14,"I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus."
50,3,15,"Let those of us who are mature have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you."
50,3,16,"Only let us live up to what we have already attained."
50,3,17,"Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who live according to the pattern you have in us."
50,3,18,"For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, live as enemies of the cross of Christ."
50,3,19,"Their end is destruction, their god is the belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things."
50,3,20,"But our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;"
50,3,21,"who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself."
50,4,1,"Therefore, my brethren, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, my beloved."
50,4,2,"I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord."
50,4,3,"Yes, and I ask you also, true yoke-fellow, to help these women who have struggled at my side in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life."
50,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice!"
50,4,5,"Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near."
50,4,6,"Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God."
50,4,7,"And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."
50,4,8,"Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things."
50,4,9,"Practice what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you."
50,4,10,"I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned before, but you had no opportunity."
50,4,11,"Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am."
50,4,12,"I know how to be in need, and I also know how to have plenty; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and want."
50,4,13,"I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
50,4,14,"Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles."
50,4,15,"You yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the first preaching of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only;"
50,4,16,"for even in Thessalonica you sent me a gift once and again for my needs."
50,4,17,"Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account."
50,4,18,"I have received full payment and even more; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God."
50,4,19,"And my God will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus."
50,4,20,"To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen."
50,4,21,"Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you."
50,4,22,"All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household."
50,4,23,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
51,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,"
51,1,2,"to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae: grace to you and peace from God our Father."
51,1,3,"We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,"
51,1,4,"because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have for all the saints,"
51,1,5,"because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel"
51,1,6,"which has come to you, just as in all the world it is bearing fruit and growing, even as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth;"
51,1,7,"as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,"
51,1,8,"and who also told us of your love in the Spirit."
51,1,9,"For this reason also, since the day we heard it, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,"
51,1,10,"so that you will live a life worthy of the Lord, to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God."
51,1,11,"May you be strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy,"
51,1,12,"giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light."
51,1,13,"For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son,"
51,1,14,"in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."
51,1,15,"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation."
51,1,16,"For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authoritiesall things were created through him and for him."
51,1,17,"He is before all things, and in him all things hold together."
51,1,18,"And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might have the first place in everything."
51,1,19,"For all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell in him"
51,1,20,"and through him, to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross."
51,1,21,"And although you were once alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,"
51,1,22,"yet he has now reconciled you in his fleshly body through death, in order to present you before him holy and blameless and beyond reproach"
51,1,23,"if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a minister."
51,1,24,"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share for the sake of his body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions."
51,1,25,"Of this church I became a minister according to the stewardship from God which was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,"
51,1,26,"the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints."
51,1,27,"To them God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."
51,1,28,"We proclaim him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ."
51,1,29,"For this end I labor, striving with all his energy, which so mightily works within me."
51,2,1,"For I want you to know how greatly I strive for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh,"
51,2,2,"that their hearts may be encouraged as they are knit together in love, to have all the riches of assured understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ himself,"
51,2,3,"in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
51,2,4,"I say this so that no one may delude you with fine-sounding arguments."
51,2,5,"For even though I am absent in flesh, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ."
51,2,6,"Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so live in him,"
51,2,7,"rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, overflowing with thanksgiving."
51,2,8,"See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to human tradition, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ."
51,2,9,"For in him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,"
51,2,10,"and you have been made complete in him, who is the head over all rule and authority."
51,2,11,"In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;"
51,2,12,"having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead."
51,2,13,"When you were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all our sins,"
51,2,14,"having canceled the certificate of debt, which stood against us with its decrees. He took what was hostile away from us, nailing it to the cross."
51,2,15,"And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them through him."
51,2,16,"Therefore let no one judge you in questions of food or drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day."
51,2,17,"These things are only a shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ."
51,2,18,"Let no one disqualify you for the prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, puffed up without cause by his fleshly mind,"
51,2,19,"and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God."
51,2,20,"If with Christ you died to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you still belonged to it, do you submit to regulations such as,"
51,2,21,"»Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!«"
51,2,22,"(referring to things which are all destined perish with use), according to human commandments and teachings?"
51,2,23,"These indeed have an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but they are of no value against fleshly indulgence."
51,3,1,"If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God."
51,3,2,"Set your minds on the things above, not on things that are on earth."
51,3,3,"For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
51,3,4,"When Christ, who is our life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory."
51,3,5,"Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire and greed, which is idolatry."
51,3,6,"Because of these, the wrath of God is coming."
51,3,7,"In these you once walked, when you lived in them."
51,3,8,"But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and filthy language from your mouth."
51,3,9,"Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old self with its practices"
51,3,10,"and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator."
51,3,11,"Here there is no Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free, but Christ is all, and in all."
51,3,12,"So, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;"
51,3,13,"bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord forgave you, so you also must forgive."
51,3,14,"And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity."
51,3,15,"Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful."
51,3,16,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God."
51,3,17,"And whatever you do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him."
51,3,18,"Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."
51,3,19,"Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them."
51,3,20,"Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord."
51,3,21,"Fathers, do not provoke your children, or they will become discouraged."
51,3,22,"Slaves, in everything obey those who are your masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord."
51,3,23,"Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,"
51,3,24,"knowing that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving."
51,3,25,"For he who does wrong will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality."
51,4,1,"Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven."
51,4,2,"Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving."
51,4,3,"And pray for us as well, that God may open a door to us for the word, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains,"
51,4,4,"so that I may make it clear, as I ought to speak."
51,4,5,"Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity."
51,4,6,"Let your speech always be full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone."
51,4,7,"Tychicus will tell you all about my affairs. He is a beloved brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord."
51,4,8,"I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts;"
51,4,9,"and with him Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of yourselves. They will tell you everything that has taken place here."
51,4,10,"My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, and also Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you have received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him.)"
51,4,11,"and also Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved to be a comfort to me."
51,4,12,"Epaphras, who is one of your number, a servant of Jesus Christ, sends you his greetings, always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God."
51,4,13,"I testify for him that he has worked hard for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis."
51,4,14,"Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas send you greetings."
51,4,15,"Give my greetings to the brethren at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house."
51,4,16,"When this letter has been read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you read the letter from Laodicea."
51,4,17,"Say to Archippus, »See to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.«"
51,4,18,"I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you."
52,1,1,"Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: grace and peace to you."
52,1,2,"We give thanks to God always for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers;"
52,1,3,"remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ."
52,1,4,"For we know, brethren beloved by God, that he has chosen you;"
52,1,5,"for our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake."
52,1,6,"You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit;"
52,1,7,"so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia."
52,1,8,"For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we have no need to say anything."
52,1,9,"For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God,"
52,1,10,"and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the deadJesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come."
52,2,1,"For you yourselves know, brethren, that our visit to you was not in vain;"
52,2,2,"but after we had already suffered and been shamefully treated in Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in the face of great opposition."
52,2,3,"For our appeal does not spring from error or impurity, nor is it made with deceit;"
52,2,4,"but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please men, but to please God who tests our hearts."
52,2,5,"For, as you know, we never used flattery nor a pretext for greedGod is witness"
52,2,6,"nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ."
52,2,7,"But we were gentle among you, like a mother nursing her little children."
52,2,8,"Having so fond an affection for you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us."
52,2,9,"For you remember our labor and toil, brethren; we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we preached to you the gospel of God."
52,2,10,"You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and blameless we behaved toward you believers;"
52,2,11,"for you know how, as a father with his own children, we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you"
52,2,12,"to live a life worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory."
52,2,13,"And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe."
52,2,14,"For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea, for you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews,"
52,2,15,"who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men,"
52,2,16,"hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved; with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them at last."
52,2,17,"But since we were taken away from you, brethren, for a short time, in person not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire to see you face to face."
52,2,18,"For we wanted to come to youI, Paul, again and againbut Satan hindered us."
52,2,19,"For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming?"
52,2,20,"For you are our glory and joy."
52,3,1,"Therefore when we could endure it no longer, we thought it best to be left behind at Athens alone,"
52,3,2,"and we sent Timothy, our brother and God's fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,"
52,3,3,"so that no one would be unsettled by these afflictions. You yourselves know that we have been destined for this."
52,3,4,"For indeed when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction; and so it came to pass, as you know."
52,3,5,"For this reason, when I could endure it no longer, I also sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor would be in vain."
52,3,6,"But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us the good news of your faith and love and reported that you always remember us kindly and long to see us, just as we long to see you"
52,3,7,"for this reason, brethren, in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith;"
52,3,8,"for now we really live, if you stand firm in the Lord."
52,3,9,"For what thanksgiving can we render to God for you in return for all the joy which we feel for your sake before our God,"
52,3,10,"as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith?"
52,3,11,"Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you;"
52,3,12,"and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, just as we do for you,"
52,3,13,"so that he may establish your hearts without blame in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints."
52,4,1,"Finally, brethren, we request and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please God, just as you are doing, you do so more and more."
52,4,2,"For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus."
52,4,3,"For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that is, that you should abstain from sexual immorality;"
52,4,4,"that each one of you know how to take his own spouse for himself in holiness and honor,"
52,4,5,"not in the passion of lust like the heathen, who do not know God;"
52,4,6,"and that no man transgress and wrong his brother in this matter because the Lord is the avenger in all these things, just as we also told you before and solemnly warned you."
52,4,7,"For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness."
52,4,8,"Therefore, he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit."
52,4,9,"Now concerning love of the brethren you have no need to have any one write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another;"
52,4,10,"and indeed you do love all the brethren throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, to do so more and more."
52,4,11,"Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business and to work with your hands, just as we told you,"
52,4,12,"so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anyone."
52,4,13,"But we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope."
52,4,14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus."
52,4,15,"For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep."
52,4,16,"For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first."
52,4,17,"Then we who are alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord."
52,4,18,"Therefore comfort one another with these words."
52,5,1,"Now as to the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need to have anything written to you."
52,5,2,"For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night."
52,5,3,"While people are saying, »Peace and safety,« then destruction will come upon them suddenly as labor pains upon a woman with child, and they will not escape."
52,5,4,"But you, brethren, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief."
52,5,5,"For you are all sons of light and sons of the day; we are not of the night or of darkness."
52,5,6,"So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us be alert and sober."
52,5,7,"For those who sleep, sleep at night; and those who get drunk, get drunk at night."
52,5,8,"But, since we belong to the day, let us be sober, and put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation."
52,5,9,"For God has not destined us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
52,5,10,"who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with him."
52,5,11,"Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, just as you also are doing."
52,5,12,"But we ask you, brethren, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,"
52,5,13,"and that you esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Live in peace with one another."
52,5,14,"And we urge you, brethren, admonish the idlers, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone."
52,5,15,"See that none of you repays evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to all."
52,5,16,"Rejoice always,"
52,5,17,"pray without ceasing,"
52,5,18,"give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."
52,5,19,"Do not quench the Spirit;"
52,5,20,"do not despise prophecies."
52,5,21,"But test everything; hold fast to what is good."
52,5,22,"Abstain from every form of evil."
52,5,23,"Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you entirely; and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
52,5,24,"He who calls you is faithful, and he will do it."
52,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us."
52,5,26,"Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss."
52,5,27,"I charge you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brethren."
52,5,28,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."
53,1,1,"Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
53,1,2,"grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,1,3,"We ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as is fitting, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing."
53,1,4,"Therefore we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which you are enduring."
53,1,5,"This is evidence of God's righteous judgment, so that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering."
53,1,6,"For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,"
53,1,7,"and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,"
53,1,8,"inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus."
53,1,9,"They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction and exclusion from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power,"
53,1,10,"when he comes to be glorified in his saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believedbecause our testimony to you was believed."
53,1,11,"To this end we always pray for you, that our God may count you worthy of his calling, and may fulfill every good resolve and work of faith by his power,"
53,1,12,"so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,1,"Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him, we beg you, brethren,"
53,2,2,"not to be quickly shaken in mind or excited, either by spirit or by word, or by letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come."
53,2,3,"Let no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,"
53,2,4,"who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God."
53,2,5,"Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?"
53,2,6,"And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he may be revealed."
53,2,7,"For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way."
53,2,8,"And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming."
53,2,9,"The coming of the lawless one by the activity of Satan will be with all power and with pretended signs and wonders,"
53,2,10,"and with all the deception of wickedness for those who are to perish, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved."
53,2,11,"For this reason God sends upon them a strong delusion so that they will believe what is false,"
53,2,12,"so that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in wickedness."
53,2,13,"But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth."
53,2,14,"He called you to this through our gospel, that you may share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,15,"So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by letter from us."
53,2,16,"Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope by grace,"
53,2,17,"comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word."
53,3,1,"Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it did also with you,"
53,3,2,"and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men; for not all have faith."
53,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one."
53,3,4,"And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will continue to do the things which we command."
53,3,5,"May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ."
53,3,6,"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother who is living in idleness and not according to the tradition which you received from us."
53,3,7,"For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you,"
53,3,8,"nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you."
53,3,9,"We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make ourselves an example for you to follow."
53,3,10,"For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: »If anyone will not work, he shall not eat.«"
53,3,11,"For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, not doing any work at all, but acting like busybodies."
53,3,12,"Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and earn their own bread to eat."
53,3,13,"But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing good."
53,3,14,"If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed."
53,3,15,"Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother."
53,3,16,"Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. The Lord be with you all."
53,3,17,"I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. This is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write."
53,3,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all."
54,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,"
54,1,2,"to Timothy, my true child in the faith: grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
54,1,3,"As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines,"
54,1,4,"nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather than the divine trainingwhich is by faith."
54,1,5,"But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith."
54,1,6,"For some men have wandered away from these things and turned aside to fruitless discussion,"
54,1,7,"wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions."
54,1,8,"But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully,"
54,1,9,"realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers"
54,1,10,"and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine,"
54,1,11,"according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted."
54,1,12,"I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, because he considered me faithful, appointing me to his service."
54,1,13,"Even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor, I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief;"
54,1,14,"and the grace of our Lord was overflowing for me, with the faith and love that are found in Christ Jesus."
54,1,15,"It is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinnersof whom I am the foremost."
54,1,16,"But I received mercy for this reason, so that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience for an example to those who would believe in him for eternal life."
54,1,17,"Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen."
54,1,18,"I give you this command, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies once made about you, that by them you may fight the good fight,"
54,1,19,"holding faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and made shipwreck of their faith."
54,1,20,"Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan so that they will be taught not to blaspheme."
54,2,1,"First of all, then, I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men,"
54,2,2,"for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity."
54,2,3,"This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,"
54,2,4,"who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth."
54,2,5,"For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,"
54,2,6,"who gave himself as a ransom for allthe testimony given at the proper time."
54,2,7,"For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth."
54,2,8,"Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or quarreling."
54,2,9,"I also want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and sensibly, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly garments,"
54,2,10,"but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess godliness."
54,2,11,"Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness."
54,2,12,"I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent."
54,2,13,"For Adam was formed first, then Eve."
54,2,14,"And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor."
54,2,15,"But women will be saved through the bearing of children, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-restraint."
54,3,1,"It is a trustworthy saying: if any one aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task."
54,3,2,"Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,"
54,3,3,"not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money."
54,3,4,"He must manage his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity"
54,3,5,"(If a man does not know how to manage his own household, how can he take care of God's church?)."
54,3,6,"He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall into the same condemnation as the devil."
54,3,7,"He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil."
54,3,8,"Deacons likewise must be men of dignity, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, and not fond of sordid gain;"
54,3,9,"they must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience."
54,3,10,"They must also first be tested; and then if they are beyond reproach, let them serve as deacons."
54,3,11,"The women must likewise be dignified, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things."
54,3,12,"Deacons must be the husband of one wife, and must manage their children and their households well."
54,3,13,"For those who have served well as deacons gain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus."
54,3,14,"Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that,"
54,3,15,"if I am delayed, you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth."
54,3,16,"By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness:"
54,4,1,"Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith by giving heed to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons,"
54,4,2,"through the pretensions of liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron,"
54,4,3,"who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth."
54,4,4,"For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving;"
54,4,5,"for it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer."
54,4,6,"If you point out these things to the brethren, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, constantly nourished on the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed."
54,4,7,"Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself in godliness."
54,4,8,"For bodily training is of some value, but godliness is of value in all things, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come."
54,4,9,"It is a trustworthy saying worthy of full acceptance."
54,4,10,"For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe."
54,4,11,"Command and teach these things."
54,4,12,"Let no one look down on your youth, but set the believers an example in speech and conduct, in love, in faith, in purity."
54,4,13,"Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching."
54,4,14,"Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you through prophetic utterance when the council of elders laid their hands on you."
54,4,15,"Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that all may see your progress."
54,4,16,"Take heed to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in them, for if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers."
54,5,1,"Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers,"
54,5,2,"older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, in all purity."
54,5,3,"Honor widows who are real widows."
54,5,4,"But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to practice their religion in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God."
54,5,5,"Now she who is a real widow, and who has been left all alone, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day."
54,5,6,"But she who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives."
54,5,7,"Command these things as well, so that they may be above reproach."
54,5,8,"If any one does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his own family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
54,5,9,"A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, having been the wife of one husband,"
54,5,10,"and she must be well known for her good deeds, as one who has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the feet of the saints, relieved those in distress, and devoted herself to doing good in every way."
54,5,11,"But refuse to put younger widows on the list, for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to marry,"
54,5,12,"thus bringing condemnation, because they have set aside their first pledge."
54,5,13,"Besides, they learn to be idle, going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to."
54,5,14,"So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their homes, and give the enemy no occasion for reproach."
54,5,15,"For some have already turned aside to follow Satan."
54,5,16,"If any woman who is a believer has dependent widows, she must assist them, and let not the church be burdened, so that it may assist those who are real widows."
54,5,17,"The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching."
54,5,18,"For the scripture says, »You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,« and, »The laborer deserves his wages.«"
54,5,19,"Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses."
54,5,20,"Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also may be fearful of sinning."
54,5,21,"I charge you, in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, doing nothing out of favoritism."
54,5,22,"Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others; keep yourself pure."
54,5,23,"No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments."
54,5,24,"The sins of some men are obvious, going before them to judgment; for others, their sins appear later."
54,5,25,"In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot be hidden."
54,6,1,"Let all who are under the yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be spoken against."
54,6,2,"Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but they must serve them all the better, because those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved."
54,6,3,"If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with godliness,"
54,6,4,"he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, which produce envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions,"
54,6,5,"and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who imagine that godliness is a means of gain."
54,6,6,"But godliness with contentment is itself great gain."
54,6,7,"For we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of it."
54,6,8,"But if we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content."
54,6,9,"But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction."
54,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."
54,6,11,"But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness."
54,6,12,"Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses."
54,6,13,"I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who made the good confession before Pontius Pilate,"
54,6,14,"to keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
54,6,15,"which he will bring about at the proper timehe who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,"
54,6,16,"who alone has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen."
54,6,17,"Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with everything to enjoy."
54,6,18,"Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, to be generous and ready to share,"
54,6,19,"storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that life which is life indeed."
54,6,20,"O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge,"
54,6,21,"which some have professed and in so doing have wandered from the faith."
55,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,"
55,1,2,"to Timothy, my beloved son: grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
55,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day."
55,1,4,"As I recall your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy."
55,1,5,"For I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and I am sure is in you as well."
55,1,6,"For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands."
55,1,7,"For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power and love and self-discipline."
55,1,8,"So do not be ashamed to testify of our Lord or of me his prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,"
55,1,9,"who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and the grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,"
55,1,10,"but has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel."
55,1,11,"For this gospel I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher."
55,1,12,"For this reason I also suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day."
55,1,13,"Follow the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus."
55,1,14,"Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure that has been entrusted to you."
55,1,15,"You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes."
55,1,16,"May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;"
55,1,17,"but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me"
55,1,18,"may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that Dayand you know very well all the service he rendered at Ephesus."
55,2,1,"You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
55,2,2,"And the things you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also."
55,2,3,"Share in hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
55,2,4,"No soldier in active service gets entangled in civilian affairs, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him as a soldier."
55,2,5,"Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules."
55,2,6,"The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops."
55,2,7,"Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything."
55,2,8,"Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descended from David according to my gospel,"
55,2,9,"for which I am suffering even to the point of wearing chains like a criminal. But the word of God is not chained."
55,2,10,"Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory."
55,2,11,"Here is a trustworthy saying:"
55,2,12,""
55,2,13,""
55,2,14,"Remind them of these things, and charge them in the presence of God to avoid disputing about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers."
55,2,15,"Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth."
55,2,16,"Avoid godless chatter, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness,"
55,2,17,"and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,"
55,2,18,"who have gone astray from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and upset the faith of some."
55,2,19,"Nevertheless, God's firm foundation stands, having this seal: »The Lord knows those who are his,« and, »Everyone who names the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.«"
55,2,20,"In a large house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for noble use, some for ignoble."
55,2,21,"If anyone cleanses himself from what is ignoble, he will be a vessel for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work."
55,2,22,"Now flee from youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart."
55,2,23,"Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know that they produce quarrels."
55,2,24,"And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome, but he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, patient when wronged,"
55,2,25,"with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God will grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,"
55,2,26,"and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will."
55,3,1,"But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of stress."
55,3,2,"For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,"
55,3,3,"unloving, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, haters of good,"
55,3,4,"treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,"
55,3,5,"holding a form of godliness but denying its power. Avoid such people."
55,3,6,"For among them are those who make their way into households and capture weak women, weighed down with sins and swayed by various impulses,"
55,3,7,"always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
55,3,8,"Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith."
55,3,9,"But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men."
55,3,10,"You, however, know all about my teaching, my conduct, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,"
55,3,11,"persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, yet the Lord rescued me from them all."
55,3,12,"Indeed all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,"
55,3,13,"while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived."
55,3,14,"But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, knowing from whom you learned it,"
55,3,15,"and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus."
55,3,16,"All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness;"
55,3,17,"so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work."
55,4,1,"I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:"
55,4,2,"preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and exhort, with great patience and instruction."
55,4,3,"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires,"
55,4,4,"and will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths."
55,4,5,"But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry."
55,4,6,"For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come."
55,4,7,"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith."
55,4,8,"In the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved his appearing."
55,4,9,"Do your best to come to me soon;"
55,4,10,"for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia."
55,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in my ministry."
55,4,12,"But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus."
55,4,13,"When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and the books, especially the parchments."
55,4,14,"Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him for his deeds."
55,4,15,"Be on guard against him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message."
55,4,16,"At my first defense no one came to my support, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them."
55,4,17,"But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was rescued from the lion's mouth."
55,4,18,"The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory for ever and ever. Amen."
55,4,19,"Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus."
55,4,20,"Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus."
55,4,21,"Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren."
55,4,22,"The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you."
56,1,1,"Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth which leads to godliness,"
56,1,2,"in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago,"
56,1,3,"and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior,"
56,1,4,"to Titus, my true child in a common faith: grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior."
56,1,5,"For this reason I left you in Crete, that you might straighten out what was left unfinished, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you,"
56,1,6,"namely, if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, and his children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild or rebellious."
56,1,7,"For the overseer must be blameless as God's steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not violent, not fond of sordid gain,"
56,1,8,"but hospitable, a lover of what is good, master of himself, upright, holy, and self-controlled;"
56,1,9,"he must hold firm to the sure word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to refute those who contradict it."
56,1,10,"For there are many rebellious men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision."
56,1,11,"They must be silenced, because they are upsetting whole families by teaching things they ought not to teach for the sake of sordid gain."
56,1,12,"One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said,"
56,1,13,"This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith"
56,1,14,"and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of men who reject the truth."
56,1,15,"To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are corrupted and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their minds and consciences are corrupted."
56,1,16,"They profess to know God, but they deny him by their deeds; they are detestable and disobedient, unfit for any good deed."
56,2,1,"But as for you, teach what befits sound doctrine."
56,2,2,"The older men are to be temperate, serious, sensible, sound in faith, in love, and in endurance."
56,2,3,"The older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not to be slanderers or slaves to much wine, but they are to teach what is good,"
56,2,4,"so they can train the young women to love their husbands and children,"
56,2,5,"to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored."
56,2,6,"Likewise urge the young men to be sensible."
56,2,7,"Show yourself in all respects an example of good deeds, and in your teaching show integrity, seriousness,"
56,2,8,"and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us."
56,2,9,"Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not to talk back to them,"
56,2,10,"and not to steal, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in everything they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior."
56,2,11,"For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,"
56,2,12,"training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this present age,"
56,2,13,"looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,"
56,2,14,"who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, zealous for good deeds."
56,2,15,"Speak these things; exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you."
56,3,1,"Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,"
56,3,2,"to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable and gentle, and to show true humility toward all men."
56,3,3,"For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by men and hating one another."
56,3,4,"But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,"
56,3,5,"he saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but because of his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit,"
56,3,6,"whom he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,"
56,3,7,"so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
56,3,8,"This is a trustworthy saying; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to devote themselves to good deeds. These things are excellent and profitable for men."
56,3,9,"But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and quarrels about the Law, for they are unprofitable and useless."
56,3,10,"Warn a man who is factious once, and then warn him a second time. After that, have nothing to do with him,"
56,3,11,"knowing that such a man is perverted and sinful; he is self-condemned."
56,3,12,"When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there."
56,3,13,"Do your best to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they lack nothing."
56,3,14,"Our people must also learn to devote themselves to good deeds, so that they may help cases of urgent need, and not be unfruitful."
56,3,15,"All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all."
57,1,1,"Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved brother and fellow worker,"
57,1,2,"and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:"
57,1,3,"grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
57,1,4,"I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,"
57,1,5,"because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints,"
57,1,6,"and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing that is ours in Christ."
57,1,7,"For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you."
57,1,8,"Therefore, though I am bold enough in Christ to order you to do what is proper,"
57,1,9,"yet for love's sake I rather appeal to yousince I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus"
57,1,10,"I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I have become in my imprisonment."
57,1,11,"Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me."
57,1,12,"I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart."
57,1,13,"I would have been glad to keep him with me, so that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel;"
57,1,14,"but without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will."
57,1,15,"Perhaps this is the reason he was separated from you for a while, that you might have him back for ever,"
57,1,16,"no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord."
57,1,17,"So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me."
57,1,18,"If he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account."
57,1,19,"I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will pay it backnot to mention that you owe me even your own self."
57,1,20,"Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ."
57,1,21,"Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say."
57,1,22,"At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope through your prayers to be granted to you."
57,1,23,"Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings,"
57,1,24,"and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers."
57,1,25,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
58,1,1,"In the past God spoke to our fathers by the prophets at many times and in various ways,"
58,1,2,"but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom also he made the world."
58,1,3,"He is the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his being, and upholds all things by the word of his power. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,"
58,1,4,"having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs."
58,1,5,"For to which of the angels did God ever say,"
58,1,6,"And again, when God brings the first-born into the world, he says,"
58,1,7,"Of the angels he says,"
58,1,8,"But of the Son he says,"
58,1,9,""
58,1,10,"And,"
58,1,11,""
58,1,12,""
58,1,13,"But to which of the angels has he ever said,"
58,1,14,"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to serve for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?"
58,2,1,"Therefore we must pay more careful attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it."
58,2,2,"For if the message spoken by angels was valid, and every transgression and disobedience received a just punishment,"
58,2,3,"how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him,"
58,2,4,"while God also bore witness, by signs and wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will."
58,2,5,"For it is not to angels that he subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking."
58,2,6,"But there is a place where someone has testified,"
58,2,7,""
58,2,8,""
58,2,9,"But we see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone."
58,2,10,"For it was fitting that he, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering."
58,2,11,"For both he who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brethren,"
58,2,12,"saying,"
58,2,13,"And again,"
58,2,14,"Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil,"
58,2,15,"and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives."
58,2,16,"For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned, but with the descendants of Abraham."
58,2,17,"Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make atonement for the sins of the people."
58,2,18,"For because he himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted."
58,3,1,"Therefore, holy brethren, who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession."
58,3,2,"He was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house."
58,3,3,"Yet Jesus has been counted worthy of as much more glory than Moses as the builder of a house has more honor than the house."
58,3,4,"For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God."
58,3,5,"Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,"
58,3,6,"but Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold fast to our confidence and the hope of which we boast."
58,3,7,"Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says:"
58,3,8,""
58,3,9,""
58,3,10,""
58,3,11,""
58,3,12,"Take care, brethren, lest there be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God."
58,3,13,"But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called »Today,« so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
58,3,14,"For we have come to share in Christ if we hold our first confidence firm to the end,"
58,3,15,"while it is said,"
58,3,16,"Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?"
58,3,17,"And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?"
58,3,18,"And to whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?"
58,3,19,"So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief."
58,4,1,"Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest remains, let us fear lest any one of you be judged to have come short of it."
58,4,2,"For we also have had the good news preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith."
58,4,3,"For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said,"
58,4,4,"For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: »And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.«"
58,4,5,"And again in this place he said, »They shall never enter my rest.«"
58,4,6,"Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had the good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,"
58,4,7,"God again set a certain day, »Today,« saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before,"
58,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later of another day."
58,4,9,"So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God;"
58,4,10,"for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his."
58,4,11,"Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience."
58,4,12,"For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart."
58,4,13,"And there is no creature hidden from his sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
58,4,14,"Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession."
58,4,15,"For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin."
58,4,16,"Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
58,5,1,"For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins."
58,5,2,"He can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is beset with weakness."
58,5,3,"Because of this he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people."
58,5,4,"And no one takes the honor upon himself, but he is called by God, just as Aaron was."
58,5,5,"So also Christ did not exalt himself to become a high priest, but it was he who said to him,"
58,5,6,"as he says also in another place,"
58,5,7,"In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his godly fear."
58,5,8,"Although he was a Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered;"
58,5,9,"and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,"
58,5,10,"being designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek."
58,5,11,"About this we have much to say which is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing."
58,5,12,"For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of God's word. You need milk, not solid food;"
58,5,13,"for every one who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe."
58,5,14,"But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their sense trained by practice to distinguish good from evil."
58,6,1,"Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,"
58,6,2,"with instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment."
58,6,3,"And this we will do, if God permits."
58,6,4,"For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,"
58,6,5,"and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,"
58,6,6,"and then have fallen away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put him to an open shame."
58,6,7,"For land which drinks the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God."
58,6,8,"But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed; its end is to be burned."
58,6,9,"Even though we speak like this, beloved, we are confident of better things in your case, things that accompany salvation."
58,6,10,"For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love which you have shown for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do."
58,6,11,"And we desire each one of you to show the same diligence in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end,"
58,6,12,"so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
58,6,13,"For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself,"
58,6,14,"saying, »I will surely bless you and multiply you.«"
58,6,15,"And so Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise."
58,6,16,"Men swear by one greater than themselves, and in all their disputes the oath is final for confirmation."
58,6,17,"So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he interposed with an oath,"
58,6,18,"so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us."
58,6,19,"We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,"
58,6,20,"where Jesus has entered as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
58,7,1,"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him."
58,7,2,"And to him Abraham gave a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace."
58,7,3,"Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest continually."
58,7,4,"See how great he was! Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the spoils."
58,7,5,"And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, though these also are descended from Abraham."
58,7,6,"But this man whose genealogy is not derived from them received a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises."
58,7,7,"And without dispute the lesser person is blessed by the greater."
58,7,8,"In this case tithes are received by mortal men, but in that case by one of whom it is witnessed that he lives on."
58,7,9,"One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,"
58,7,10,"for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him."
58,7,11,"Now if perfection could have been through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not one designated according to the order of Aaron?"
58,7,12,"For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law."
58,7,13,"For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar."
58,7,14,"For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests."
58,7,15,"This becomes even more evident if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek,"
58,7,16,"who has become a priest not on the basis of a law of carnal requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life."
58,7,17,"For it is declared of him,"
58,7,18,"On the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness"
58,7,19,"(for the law made nothing perfect); and on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God."
58,7,20,"And it was not without an oath."
58,7,21,"Those who formerly became priests took their office without an oath, but he became a priest with an oath through the One who said to him,"
58,7,22,"Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant."
58,7,23,"The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office;"
58,7,24,"but he holds his priesthood forever, because he continues for ever."
58,7,25,"Therefore he is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them."
58,7,26,"For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, unstained, separated from sinners, exalted above the heavens."
58,7,27,"He does not need, like those high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people, because he did this once for all when he offered up himself."
58,7,28,"For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever."
58,8,1,"Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,"
58,8,2,"a minister in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle which is set up by the Lord, not by man."
58,8,3,"For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; and so it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer."
58,8,4,"Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law."
58,8,5,"They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary; for when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle, he was instructed by God, saying, »See that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain.«"
58,8,6,"But as it is, he has obtained a ministry which is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises."
58,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no place sought for a second."
58,8,8,"For he finds fault with them when he says:"
58,8,9,""
58,8,10,""
58,8,11,""
58,8,12,""
58,8,13,"When he said, »A new covenant,« he has made the first obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away."
58,9,1,"Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary."
58,9,2,"For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place."
58,9,3,"Behind the second curtain was a tabernacle called the Holy of Holies,"
58,9,4,"having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, which contained a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;"
58,9,5,"and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. But of these things we cannot now speak in detail."
58,9,6,"These preparations having thus been made, the priests go continually into the outer tabernacle, performing their ritual duties."
58,9,7,"But into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance."
58,9,8,"The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the holy place had not yet been disclosed as long as the outer tabernacle was still standing."
58,9,9,"This is symbolic for the present time. According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,"
58,9,10,"since they relate only to food and drink and various washings  regulations for the flesh imposed until the time of reformation."
58,9,11,"But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, he entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation."
58,9,12,"He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves, but he entered the holy place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption."
58,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,"
58,9,14,"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
58,9,15,"For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the transgressions committed under the first covenant."
58,9,16,"For where a will is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it."
58,9,17,"For a will is in force only when somebody has died, since it never takes effect while the one who made it is living."
58,9,18,"This is why even the first covenant was not ratified without blood."
58,9,19,"For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,"
58,9,20,"saying, »This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.«"
58,9,21,"And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels used in worship."
58,9,22,"Indeed, under the law almost everything is cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins."
58,9,23,"It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
58,9,24,"For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us."
58,9,25,"Nor was it that he should offer himself again and again, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood not his own."
58,9,26,"For then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself."
58,9,27,"And just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment,"
58,9,28,"so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin but to bring salvation to those who are eagerly waiting for him."
58,10,1,"For since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices which are continually offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near."
58,10,2,"Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered? If the worshipers had once been cleansed, they would no longer have any consciousness of sins."
58,10,3,"But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year."
58,10,4,"For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins."
58,10,5,"Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said:"
58,10,6,""
58,10,7,""
58,10,8,"When he said above, »You did not desire, nor did you take pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings« (these are offered according to the law),"
58,10,9,"then he said, »Behold, I have come to do your will.« He takes away the first in order to establish the second."
58,10,10,"And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."
58,10,11,"And every priest stands daily at his service, offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins."
58,10,12,"But when he had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,"
58,10,13,"waiting from that time until his enemies be made a stool for his feet."
58,10,14,"For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified."
58,10,15,"And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,"
58,10,16,""
58,10,17,"then he adds,"
58,10,18,"Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin."
58,10,19,"Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,"
58,10,20,"by a new and living way which he opened for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh,"
58,10,21,"and since we have a great priest over the house of God,"
58,10,22,"let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water."
58,10,23,"Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful;"
58,10,24,"and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works,"
58,10,25,"not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more, as you see the Day drawing near."
58,10,26,"For if we sin deliberately after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,"
58,10,27,"but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries."
58,10,28,"Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses."
58,10,29,"How much severer punishment do you think a man will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as an unclean thing the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?"
58,10,30,"For we know him who said,"
58,10,31,"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
58,10,32,"But remember the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings,"
58,10,33,"sometimes being publicly exposed to insult and persecution; and at other times standing side by side with those who were so treated."
58,10,34,"For you had compassion on the prisoners, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one."
58,10,35,"Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward."
58,10,36,"For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised."
58,10,37,""
58,10,38,""
58,10,39,"But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and keep their souls."
58,11,1,"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen."
58,11,2,"For by it the men of old received divine approval."
58,11,3,"By faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible."
58,11,4,"By faith Abel offered God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his gifts. And through faith he still speaks, even though he is dead."
58,11,5,"By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had taken him. For before he was taken he was attested as having pleased God."
58,11,6,"And without faith it is impossible to please God, for anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him."
58,11,7,"By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in godly fear prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which comes by faith."
58,11,8,"By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going."
58,11,9,"By faith he lived in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise;"
58,11,10,"for he was looking forward to the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God."
58,11,11,"By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, because she considered him faithful who had promised."
58,11,12,"Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore."
58,11,13,"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from a distance, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth."
58,11,14,"For people who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own."
58,11,15,"And if they had been thinking of that country from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return."
58,11,16,"But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city."
58,11,17,"By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son,"
58,11,18,"of whom it was said, »Through Isaac shall your descendants be called.«"
58,11,19,"He considered that God was able to raise men even from the dead; from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back."
58,11,20,"By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future."
58,11,21,"By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshipped as he leaned on the top of his staff."
58,11,22,"By faith Joseph, when he was at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites, and gave orders concerning his bones."
58,11,23,"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king's edict."
58,11,24,"By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,"
58,11,25,"choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin."
58,11,26,"He considered abuse suffered for the Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his reward."
58,11,27,"By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king; for he endured as seeing him who is invisible."
58,11,28,"By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them."
58,11,29,"By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned."
58,11,30,"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days."
58,11,31,"By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had welcomed the spies."
58,11,32,"And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,"
58,11,33,"who through faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of justice, received promises, shut the mouths of lions,"
58,11,34,"quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, whose weakness was turned to strength, who became mighty in war, and put foreign armies to flight."
58,11,35,"Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection."
58,11,36,"And others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment."
58,11,37,"They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, ill-treated "
58,11,38,"of whom the world was not worthy  wandering in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground."
58,11,39,"And all these, though well attested by their faith, did not receive what was promised,"
58,11,40,"because God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect."
58,12,1,"Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us,"
58,12,2,"fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
58,12,3,"Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary and lose heart."
58,12,4,"In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood."
58,12,5,"And have you forgotten the exhortation which addresses you as sons? "
58,12,6,""
58,12,7,"It is for discipline that you endure. God is treating you as sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?"
58,12,8,"If you are left without discipline, in which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons."
58,12,9,"Besides this, we have had fathers of our flesh to discipline us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?"
58,12,10,"For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness."
58,12,11,"For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant; but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it."
58,12,12,"Therefore lift your feeble hands and strengthen your weak knees,"
58,12,13,"and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed."
58,12,14,"Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord."
58,12,15,"See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness spring up and cause trouble, and by it many become defiled;"
58,12,16,"that no one be immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal."
58,12,17,"For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears."
58,12,18,"For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,"
58,12,19,"and the blast of a trumpet, and the sound of a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further word be spoken to them."
58,12,20,"For they could not endure the order that was given, »If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.«"
58,12,21,"The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, »I am trembling with fear.«"
58,12,22,"But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the joyful assembly"
58,12,23,"and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,"
58,12,24,"and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks better than the blood of Abel."
58,12,25,"See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less shall we escape, if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven?"
58,12,26,"Then his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, »Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also heaven.«"
58,12,27,"This phrase, »Yet once more,« indicates the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, in order that what cannot be shaken may remain."
58,12,28,"Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe,"
58,12,29,"for our God is a consuming fire."
58,13,1,"Let brotherly love continue."
58,13,2,"Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it."
58,13,3,"Remember the prisoners, as though in prison with them, and those who are ill-treated, since you yourselves are also in the body."
58,13,4,"Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled; for God will judge the immoral and adulterous."
58,13,5,"Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, for God has said, »I will never leave you, nor will I forsake you.«"
58,13,6,"So we say with confidence,"
58,13,7,"Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God; consider the outcome of their life, and imitate their faith."
58,13,8,"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever."
58,13,9,"Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited."
58,13,10,"We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat."
58,13,11,"For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp."
58,13,12,"And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to sanctify the people through his own blood."
58,13,13,"Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore."
58,13,14,"For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city which is to come."
58,13,15,"Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name."
58,13,16,"Do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased."
58,13,17,"Obey your leaders and submit to them; for they are keeping watch over your souls, as men who will have to give account. Let them do this with joy, and not with grief, for that would be of no advantage to you."
58,13,18,"Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things."
58,13,19,"I urge you all the more to do this so that I may be restored to you the sooner."
58,13,20,"Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the eternal covenant,"
58,13,21,"equip you with every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."
58,13,22,"I urge you, brethren, bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly."
58,13,23,"You should know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I will see you if he comes soon."
58,13,24,"Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings."
58,13,25,"Grace be with you all."
59,1,1,"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: greetings."
59,1,2,"Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,"
59,1,3,"for you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance."
59,1,4,"And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."
59,1,5,"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him."
59,1,6,"But he must ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind."
59,1,7,"For that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the Lord,"
59,1,8,"being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways."
59,1,9,"But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position;"
59,1,10,"and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like the flower of the grass he will pass away."
59,1,11,"For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls and its beauty is destroyed. So will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits."
59,1,12,"Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, for when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him."
59,1,13,"Let no one say when he is tempted, »I am being tempted by God«; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself does not tempt anyone."
59,1,14,"But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own desire."
59,1,15,"Then when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is full-grown, it brings forth death."
59,1,16,"Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren."
59,1,17,"Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow."
59,1,18,"Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures."
59,1,19,"This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger,"
59,1,20,"for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God."
59,1,21,"Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and rank growth of wickedness, in humility receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls."
59,1,22,"But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves."
59,1,23,"For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;"
59,1,24,"for he looks at himself and goes away, and immediately forgets what he was like."
59,1,25,"But one who looks intently into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but a doer that acts, this man will be blessed in what he does."
59,1,26,"If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is worthless."
59,1,27,"Religion that is pure and undefiled in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world."
59,2,1,"My brethren, show no favoritism as you hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ."
59,2,2,"For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in shabby clothes,"
59,2,3,"and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes and say, »Have a seat here in a good place,« and you say to the poor man, »You stand there,« or, »Sit by my feet,«"
59,2,4,"have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?"
59,2,5,"Listen, my beloved brethren: has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?"
59,2,6,"But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who drag you into court?"
59,2,7,"Is it not they who blaspheme the honorable name by which you have been called?"
59,2,8,"If you really fulfill the royal law, according to the scripture, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself,« you are doing well."
59,2,9,"But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors."
59,2,10,"For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all of it."
59,2,11,"For he who said, »Do not commit adultery,« said also, »Do not murder.« If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law."
59,2,12,"So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty."
59,2,13,"For judgment will be without mercy to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment."
59,2,14,"What good is it, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has no works? Can such faith save him?"
59,2,15,"If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,"
59,2,16,"and one of you says to them, »Go in peace, be warmed and filled,« and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?"
59,2,17,"So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead."
59,2,18,"But someone will say, »You have faith and I have works.« Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
59,2,19,"You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believeand shudder."
59,2,20,"But are you willing to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is useless?"
59,2,21,"Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?"
59,2,22,"You see that faith was working with his works, and faith was completed by works,"
59,2,23,"and the scripture was fulfilled which says, »Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness«, and he was called the friend of God."
59,2,24,"You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone."
59,2,25,"In the same way was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works, when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?"
59,2,26,"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
59,3,1,"Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness."
59,3,2,"For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well."
59,3,3,"If we put bits into the mouths of horses that they may obey us, we guide their whole bodies."
59,3,4,"Look at the ships also; though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs."
59,3,5,"So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things."
59,3,6,"And the tongue is a fire, a world of evil among the members of the body. The tongue corrupts our whole person, sets the whole course of our life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell."
59,3,7,"For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race."
59,3,8,"But no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison."
59,3,9,"With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God."
59,3,10,"From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brethren, this ought not to be so."
59,3,11,"Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?"
59,3,12,"Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh."
59,3,13,"Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good life let him show his deeds in the humility of wisdom."
59,3,14,"But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth."
59,3,15,"This wisdom is not such as comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic."
59,3,16,"For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every evil practice."
59,3,17,"But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, without uncertainty or hypocrisy."
59,3,18,"And the harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace."
59,4,1,"What causes quarrels and fights among you? Is it not your passions that are at war in your members?"
59,4,2,"You desire and do not have; so you kill. And you covet and cannot obtain; so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask."
59,4,3,"You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures."
59,4,4,"You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God."
59,4,5,"Or do you think that the Scripture says without reason: »He jealously desires the Spirit which he has made to dwell in us«?"
59,4,6,"But he gives more grace. Therefore it says,"
59,4,7,"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you."
59,4,8,"Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded."
59,4,9,"Be miserable and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom."
59,4,10,"Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you."
59,4,11,"Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it."
59,4,12,"There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But youwho are you to judge your neighbor?"
59,4,13,"Come now, you who say, »Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.«"
59,4,14,"Yet you do not know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes."
59,4,15,"Instead, you ought to say, »If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.«"
59,4,16,"As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil."
59,4,17,"Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin."
59,5,1,"Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you."
59,5,2,"Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten."
59,5,3,"Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days."
59,5,4,"Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out against you; and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts."
59,5,5,"You have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter."
59,5,6,"You have condemned and put to death the righteous man; he does not resist you."
59,5,7,"Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and late rains."
59,5,8,"You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near."
59,5,9,"Do not grumble, brethren, against one another, that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door."
59,5,10,"As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord."
59,5,11,"Behold, we call those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy."
59,5,12,"But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath, but let your yes be yes and your no be no, that you may not fall under condemnation."
59,5,13,"Is anyone among you suffering? He should pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise."
59,5,14,"Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;"
59,5,15,"and the prayer offered in faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven."
59,5,16,"Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective."
59,5,17,"Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months."
59,5,18,"Then he prayed again, and the heavens gave rain and the earth produced its fruit."
59,5,19,"My brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back,"
59,5,20,"let him know that whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins."
60,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen exiles in the Dispersion, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,"
60,1,2,"who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling with his blood: may grace and peace be yours in abundance."
60,1,3,"Blessed be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has caused us to be born again into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"
60,1,4,"to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, kept in heaven for you,"
60,1,5,"who are protected by God's power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."
60,1,6,"In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have to suffer various trials,"
60,1,7,"so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
60,1,8,"Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an inexpressible and glorious joy,"
60,1,9,"as you obtain the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls."
60,1,10,"As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you inquired and searched carefully,"
60,1,11,"seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow."
60,1,12,"It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaventhings into which angels long to look."
60,1,13,"Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be sober in spirit, set your hope fully on the grace to be given you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
60,1,14,"As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance,"
60,1,15,"but as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct;"
60,1,16,"because it is written, »You shall be holy, for I am holy.«"
60,1,17,"If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your exile on earth."
60,1,18,"You know that you were redeemed from the futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,"
60,1,19,"but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot."
60,1,20,"He was destined before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake."
60,1,21,"Through him you have confidence in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God."
60,1,22,"Since you have purified your souls by obedience to the truth for a sincere love of the brethren, love one another earnestly from the heart."

60,2,13,"Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the supreme authority,"
60,2,14,"or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right."
60,2,15,"For it is God's will that by doing right you should silence the ignorance of foolish men."
60,2,16,"Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a covering for evil; live as servants of God."

60,2,18,"Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are overbearing."
60,2,19,"For a man is approved if, mindful of God, he bears up under pain while suffering unjustly."
60,2,20,"For what credit is it, if when you do wrong and are beaten for it you patiently endure? But if when you do right and suffer for it you patiently endure, you have favor with God."
60,2,21,"For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps."

60,2,23,"when he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he uttered no threats, but he trusted himself to him who judges justly."

60,2,25,"For you were straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls."
60,3,1,"You wives, in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without a word by the behavior of their wives,"
60,3,2,"when they see your chaste and respectful behavior."
60,3,3,"Your adornment must not be merely outwardbraiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on fine clothing;"
60,3,4,"but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in God's sight."
60,3,5,"For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, and were submissive to their own husbands;"

60,3,15,"but in your hearts reverence Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and respect;"
60,3,16,"and keep a clear conscience, so that, when you are abused, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame."
60,3,17,"For it is better to suffer for doing right, if that should be God's will, than for doing wrong."
60,3,18,"For Christ also died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit;"
60,3,19,"in which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison,"
60,3,20,"who formerly did not obey, when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water."
60,3,21,"And corresponding to that, baptism now saves younot the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good consciencethrough the resurrection of Jesus Christ,"
60,3,22,"who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels and authorities and powers subject to him."
60,4,1,"Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,"
60,4,2,"so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human lusts, but for the will of God."

61,1,1,"Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:"
61,1,2,"grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord."
61,1,3,"His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and excellence."
61,1,4,"By these he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may escape from the corruption that is in the world because of lust, and become partakers of the divine nature."
61,1,5,"For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith virtue; and to virtue, knowledge,"
61,1,6,"and to knowledge, self-control, and to self-control, perseverance, and to perseverance, godliness,"
61,1,7,"and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, love."
61,1,8,"For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
61,1,9,"For whoever lacks these things is blind and shortsighted, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins."
61,1,10,"Therefore, brethren, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall;"
61,1,11,"so there will be an entrance richly provided for you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
61,1,12,"Therefore I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have."
61,1,13,"I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to stir you up by way of reminder,"
61,1,14,"since I know that the putting aside of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me."
61,1,15,"And I will see to it that after my departure you will be able at any time to call these things to mind."
61,1,16,"For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
61,1,17,"For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«"
61,1,18,"We ourselves heard this voice coming from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain."
61,1,19,"And we have the prophetic word made more sure, and you will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts."
61,1,20,"First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,"
61,1,21,"for no prophecy was ever made by the act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God."
61,2,1,"But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves."
61,2,2,"And many will follow their licentiousness, and because of them the way of truth will be reviled."
61,2,3,"And in their greed they will exploit you with false words; from long ago their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction has not been asleep."
61,2,4,"For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;"
61,2,5,"and if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;"
61,2,6,"and if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly thereafter;"
61,2,7,"and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men"
61,2,8,"(for by what he saw and heard that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds),"
61,2,9,"then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,"
61,2,10,"and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desire and despise authority."
61,2,11,"whereas angels, though greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord."
61,2,12,"But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and killed, reviling in matters of which they are ignorant, will be destroyed in the same destruction with them,"
61,2,13,"suffering wrong for their wrongdoing. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, as they carouse with you."
61,2,14,"They have eyes full of adultery, that never cease from sin; they entice unstable souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!"
61,2,15,"Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;"
61,2,16,"but he was rebuked for his own transgression by a donkeya beast without speechwho spoke with a man's voice and restrained the prophet's madness."
61,2,17,"These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm; for them the blackest darkness has been reserved."
61,2,18,"For speaking out arrogant words of vanity, they entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones who live in error."
61,2,19,"They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for whatever overcomes a man, to that he is enslaved."
61,2,20,"For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first."
61,2,21,"For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them."
61,2,22,"It has happened to them according to the true proverb,"
61,3,1,"This is now the second letter that I have written to you, beloved, and in both of them I have aroused your sincere mind by way of reminder;"
61,3,2,"that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior spoken through your apostles."
61,3,3,"First of all you must understand this, that scoffers will come in the last days, with scoffing, following their own lusts"
61,3,4,"and saying, »Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.«"
61,3,5,"They deliberately ignore this fact, that by the word of God heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and by means of water,"
61,3,6,"through which the world at that time was destroyed, being deluged with water."
61,3,7,"But by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men."
61,3,8,"But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day."
61,3,9,"The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance."
61,3,10,"But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with fire, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up."
61,3,11,"Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy lives and godliness,"
61,3,12,"looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and the elements will melt with intense heat!"
61,3,13,"But according to his promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells."
61,3,14,"Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by him in peace, spotless and blameless."
61,3,15,"And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you."
61,3,16,"He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction."
61,3,17,"You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your own steadfastness."
61,3,18,"But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen."
62,1,1,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have touched, concerning the Word of life"
62,1,2,"the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and testify to it, and proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us"
62,1,3,"that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ."
62,1,4,"And we write this that our joy may be complete."
62,1,5,"This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you, that God is light and in him is no darkness at all."
62,1,6,"If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not live according to the truth."
62,1,7,"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin."
62,1,8,"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
62,1,9,"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
62,1,10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."
62,2,1,"My little children, I write this to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."
62,2,2,"And he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world."
62,2,3,"Now by this we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments."
62,2,4,"He who says, »I know him,« but does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
62,2,5,"But whoever keeps his word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in him:"
62,2,6,"he who says he abides in him ought to walk as he walked."
62,2,7,"Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard."
62,2,8,"Yet I am writing you a new commandment, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining."
62,2,9,"He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness still."
62,2,10,"He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him."
62,2,11,"But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."
62,2,12,""
62,2,13,""
62,2,14,""
62,2,15,"Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
62,2,16,"For all that is in the worldthe lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of lifeis not of the Father but is of the world."
62,2,17,"And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever."
62,2,18,"Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come; by this we know that it is the last hour."
62,2,19,"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out that it might be plain that none of them were of us."
62,2,20,"But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know."
62,2,21,"I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth."
62,2,22,"Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son."
62,2,23,"No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also."
62,2,24,"Let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you also will abide in the Son and in the Father."
62,2,25,"And this is what he has promised useternal life."
62,2,26,"These things I have written to you about those who try to deceive you."
62,2,27,"But the anointing which you have received from him abides in you, and you do not need that anyone teach you; but as his anointing teaches you about all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, abide in him."
62,2,28,"And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming."
62,2,29,"If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does right is born of him."
62,3,1,"See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God! And so we are! The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him."
62,3,2,"Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is."
62,3,3,"And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure."
62,3,4,"Everyone who commits sin also commits lawlessness; sin is lawlessness."
62,3,5,"And you know that he appeared to take away our sins, and in him there is no sin."
62,3,6,"No one who abides in him sins. No one who sins has either seen him or known him."
62,3,7,"Little children, let no one deceive you. He who does right is righteous, just as he is righteous."
62,3,8,"He who commits sin is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil."
62,3,9,"No one who is of God practices sin, for Gods seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God."
62,3,10,"By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother."
62,3,11,"For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,"
62,3,12,"and not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous."
62,3,13,"Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you."
62,3,14,"We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death."
62,3,15,"Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."
62,3,16,"By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."
62,3,17,"But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?"
62,3,18,"Little children, let us not love in word or tongue but in deed and in truth."
62,3,19,"By this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him"
62,3,20,"whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything."
62,3,21,"Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God;"
62,3,22,"and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him."
62,3,23,"And this is his commandment: that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as he has commanded us."
62,3,24,"Now those who keep his commandments abide in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us."
62,4,1,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
62,4,2,"By this you know the Spirit of God: every Spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,"
62,4,3,"and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God. This is the spirit of the Antichrist, of which you have heard that it was coming, and now it is in the world already."
62,4,4,"You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world."
62,4,5,"They are of the world and therefore speak as of the world, and the world listens to them."
62,4,6,"We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us; he who is not of God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error."
62,4,7,"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God."
62,4,8,"He who does not love does not know God, for God is love."
62,4,9,"In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him."
62,4,10,"In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins."
62,4,11,"Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another."
62,4,12,"No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us."
62,4,13,"By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit."
62,4,14,"And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world."
62,4,15,"Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God."
62,4,16,"So we know and believe the love God has for us."
62,4,17,"In this love is perfected among us, that we may have confidence for the Day of Judgment, because as he is so are we in this world."
62,4,18,"There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. And he who fears is not made perfect in love."
62,4,19,"We love because he first loved us."
62,4,20,"If anyone says, »I love God,« and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen."
62,4,21,"And this commandment we have from him: that he who loves God must love his brother also."
62,5,1,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the parent loves the child."
62,5,2,"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments."
62,5,3,"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome."
62,5,4,"For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the worldour faith."
62,5,5,"Who is it that overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"
62,5,6,"This is he who came by water and bloodJesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood."
62,5,7,"And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth."
62,5,8,"There are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree."
62,5,9,"If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God which he has borne witness of his Son."
62,5,10,"He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given of his Son."
62,5,11,"And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son."
62,5,12,"He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life."
62,5,13,"I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life."
62,5,14,"And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us."
62,5,15,"And if we know that he hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him."
62,5,16,"If anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not lead to death, he will ask, and God will give him life for those whose sin is not leading to death. There is sin leading to death. I do not say that he should pray about that."
62,5,17,"All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death."
62,5,18,"We know that anyone born of God does not sin; but he who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him."
62,5,19,"We know that we are of God, and the whole world is under the power of the evil one."
62,5,20,"And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life."
62,5,21,"Little children, keep yourselves from idols."
63,1,1,"The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth,"
63,1,2,"because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:"
63,1,3,"grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love."
63,1,4,"I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father."
63,1,5,"And now I ask you, lady, not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning, that we love one another."
63,1,6,"And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in love."
63,1,7,"For many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist."
63,1,8,"Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may receive a full reward."
63,1,9,"Anyone who runs ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son."
63,1,10,"If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting;"
63,1,11,"for he who greets him shares in his wicked work."
63,1,12,"Though I have much to write to you, I do not want to use paper and ink, but I hope to come to see you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete."
63,1,13,"The children of your chosen sister greet you."
64,1,1,"The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth."
64,1,2,"Beloved, I pray that you may be in good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well."
64,1,3,"For I greatly rejoiced when some of the brethren arrived and testified to the truth of your life, and how you are walking in truth."
64,1,4,"I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my children are walking in the truth."
64,1,5,"Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brethren, and especially when they are strangers;"
64,1,6,"and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God."
64,1,7,"For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles."
64,1,8,"Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers in the truth."
64,1,9,"I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say."
64,1,10,"So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, gossiping against us with evil words. And not satisfied with that, he refuses himself to welcome the brethren, and also stops those who want to welcome them and puts them out of the church."
64,1,11,"Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God."
64,1,12,"Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true."
64,1,13,"I had much to write you, but I do not want to do so with pen and ink;"
64,1,14,"I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. Peace to you. The friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name."
65,1,1,"Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:"
65,1,2,"may mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you."
65,1,3,"Beloved, although I was very eager to write you about our common salvation, I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you contend for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints."
65,1,4,"For certain persons have crept in secretly, those who were long ago marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ."
65,1,5,"Now I desire to remind you, though you were once for all fully informed, that the Lord who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe."
65,1,6,"And the angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, he has kept in eternal chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day,"
65,1,7,"just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise acted immorally and indulged in strange flesh, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire."
65,1,8,"Yet in the same way these men in their dreamings defile the flesh, reject authority, and revile the glorious ones."
65,1,9,"But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a reviling judgment, but said, »The Lord rebuke you!«"
65,1,10,"But these men revile whatever they do not understand; and the things that they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals do, by these things they are destroyed."
65,1,11,"Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for the sake of gain they have rushed headlong into the Balaam's error, and perished in Korah's rebellion."
65,1,12,"These are the men who are blemishes in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, uprooted;"
65,1,13,"wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the blackest darkness has been reserved forever."
65,1,14,"It was also about these men that Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, »Behold, the Lord came with many thousands of his holy ones,"
65,1,15,"to execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.«"
65,1,16,"These are grumblers, finding fault, following after their own lusts; they speak arrogantly, flattering people for their own advantage."
65,1,17,"But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
65,1,18,"they said to you, »In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly lusts.«"
65,1,19,"These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly-minded, devoid of the Spirit."

66,12,7,"And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back,"
66,12,8,"but they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven."
66,12,9,"And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole worldhe was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him."
66,12,10,"Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying,"
66,12,11,""
66,12,12,""
66,12,13,"And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child."
66,12,14,"But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is to be nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent."
66,12,15,"And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with the flood."
66,12,16,"But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon had poured out of his mouth."
66,12,17,"Then the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus."
66,13,1,"And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. He had ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on his horns, and on his heads were blasphemous names."
66,13,2,"The beast that I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority."
66,13,3,"One of its heads seemed to have a fatal wound, but its fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth followed the beast with wonder."
66,13,4,"Men worshipped the dragon, because he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshipped the beast, saying, »Who is like the beast, and who can make war against him?«"
66,13,5,"And the beast was given a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months."
66,13,6,"And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven."
66,13,7,"Also it was given power to make war on the saints and to conquer them. And authority was given it over every tribe and people and tongue and nation,"
66,13,8,"and all who dwell on earth will worship it, every one whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain."
66,13,9,"If anyone has an ear, let him hear."
66,13,10,""
66,13,11,"Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon."
66,13,12,"He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed."
66,13,13,"He performs great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men."
66,13,14,"And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which he was given power to do in the presence of the beast. He ordered them to make an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived."
66,13,15,"And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should even speak, and to cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed."
66,13,16,"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to be given a mark on their right hand or the forehead,"
66,13,17,"so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name."
66,13,18,"This calls for wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; its number is six hundred and sixty-six."
66,14,1,"Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads."
66,14,2,"I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps."
66,14,3,"And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth."
66,14,4,"These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb."
66,14,5,"And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless."
66,14,6,"Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;"
66,14,7,"and he said with a loud voice, »Fear God, and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come; worship him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of water.«"
66,14,8,"And another angel, a second, followed, saying, »Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all the nations drink the wine of her impure passion.«"
66,14,9,"And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, »If any one worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,"
66,14,10,"he also will drink of the wine of Gods wrath, which is poured in full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb."
66,14,11,"And the smoke of their torment goes up for ever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.«"
66,14,12,"Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus."
66,14,13,"And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, »Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!« »Yes,« says the Spirit, »that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.«"
66,14,14,"Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand."
66,14,15,"And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, »Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.«"
66,14,16,"So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped."
66,14,17,"And another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle."
66,14,18,"Then another angel came out from the altar, the one who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, »Put in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because its grapes are ripe.«"
66,14,19,"So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the clusters from the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God."
66,14,20,"And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the wine press, as high as the horses' bridles for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia."
66,15,1,"Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, because with them the wrath of God is finished."
66,15,2,"And I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire and, standing beside the sea of glass, those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and over the number of his name. They held harps of God"
66,15,3,"and they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,"
66,15,4,""
66,15,5,"After this I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened,"
66,15,6,"and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in linen, clean and bright, and girded around their chests with golden sashes."
66,15,7,"Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever."
66,15,8,"And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed."
66,16,1,"Then I heard a loud voice from the temple, saying to the seven angels, »Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.«"
66,16,2,"So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and foul and loathsome sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshipped his image."
66,16,3,"The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man, and every living thing in the sea died."
66,16,4,"The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood."
66,16,5,"And I heard the angel of the waters say,"
66,16,6,""
66,16,7,"And I heard the altar saying,"
66,16,8,"The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to it to scorch men with fire."
66,16,9,"Men were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues, and they did not repent and give him glory."
66,16,10,"The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was plunged into darkness; men gnawed their tongues in agony"
66,16,11,"and they cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and they did not repent of their deeds."
66,16,12,"The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the East."
66,16,13,"And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs;"
66,16,14,"for they are spirits of demons, performing miraculous signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty."
66,16,15,"(»Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him, so that he may not go naked and be shamefully exposed.«)"
66,16,16,"And they gathered them together at the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon."
66,16,17,"The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, »It is done!«"
66,16,18,"And there were flashes of lightning and voices and peals of thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man came to be on the earth, so great an earthquake was it, and so mighty."
66,16,19,"The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath."
66,16,20,"And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found."
66,16,21,"Huge hailstones, about a hundred pounds each, fell from heaven upon men. And men cursed God for the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible."
66,17,1,"Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, »Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,"
66,17,2,"with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication.«"
66,17,3,"And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns."
66,17,4,"The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality,"
66,17,5,"And on her forehead was written a name of mystery,"
66,17,6,"And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered greatly."
66,17,7,"And the angel said to me, »Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns."
66,17,8,"The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, because he was and is not and will come."
66,17,9,"This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits."
66,17,10,"And they are also seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while."
66,17,11,"The beast who was, and is not, is an eighth. He belongs to the seven and he goes to destruction."
66,17,12,"And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour."
66,17,13,"These have one purpose and they give their power and authority to the beast."
66,17,14,"These will make war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with him are the called and chosen and faithful.«"
66,17,15,"And he said to me, »The waters you saw where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues."
66,17,16,"And the ten horns you saw, they and the beast will hate the harlot; they will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and burn her up with fire,"
66,17,17,"for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and giving over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled."
66,17,18,"The woman that you saw is the great city which has dominion over the kings of the earth.«"
66,18,1,"After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority; and the earth was made bright with his splendor."
66,18,2,"And he called out with a mighty voice,"
66,18,3,""
66,18,4,"Then I heard another voice from heaven, saying,"

66,18,11,"And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more"
66,18,12,"cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble;"
66,18,13,"cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and chariots; and slaves and human souls."

66,18,17,""
66,18,18,"and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like the great city?"
66,18,19,"And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying,"
66,18,20,""
66,18,21,"Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying,"

66,19,3,"And again they shouted,"
66,19,4,"And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God who is seated on the throne, saying,"
66,19,5,"And a voice came from the throne, saying,"
66,19,6,"Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying,"

66,19,8,""
66,19,9,"Then the angel said to me, »Write, Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.« And he said to me, »These are true words of God.«"
66,19,10,"Then I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, »You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.«"
66,19,11,"Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war."
66,19,12,"His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems; and he has a name written on him which no one knows but himself."
66,19,13,"He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God."
66,19,14,"The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses, and dressed in fine linen, white and clean."
66,19,15,"From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron; he treads the wine press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty."
66,19,16,"And he has on his robe and on his thigh a name written,"
66,19,17,"Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he cried to all the birds that fly in midheaven, »Come, gather for the great supper of God,"
66,19,18,"so that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.«"
66,19,19,"And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who sits on the horse and against his army."
66,19,20,"And the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who had performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with sulfur."
66,19,21,"And the rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of him who sat on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh."
66,20,1,"Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key of the abyss and a great chain."
66,20,2,"And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,"
66,20,3,"and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any more, until the thousand years were ended. After these things he must be released for a short time."
66,20,4,"Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom judgment was given. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony to Jesus and because of the word of God, and who had not worshipped the beast or his image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life, and reigned with Christ a thousand years."
66,20,5,"The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection."

66,20,10,"And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
66,20,11,"Then I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it; from his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them."
66,20,12,"And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Also another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done."
66,20,13,"The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them, and all were judged according to what they had done."
66,20,14,"Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire."
66,20,15,"And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire."

66,21,2,"And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."
66,21,3,"And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, »Behold, the dwelling of God is with men. And he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be with them;"

66,21,8,"But as for the cowardly, the unbelieving, the immoral, as for murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their lot will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.«"
66,21,9,"Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke to me, saying, »Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.«"
66,21,10,"And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,"
66,21,11,"having the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal."
66,21,12,"It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel."

66,21,15,"The one who talked with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its walls."
66,21,16,"The city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the rod, twelve thousand stadia; its length and width and height are equal."
66,21,17,"He also measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits by a man's measure, which is also an angel's."
66,21,18,"The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as clear as glass."
66,21,19,"The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,"
66,21,20,"the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst."
66,21,21,"And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass."
66,21,22,"And I saw no temple in the city, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple."
66,21,23,"And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb."
66,21,24,"The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it."
66,21,25,"In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be shut;"
66,21,26,"they will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations."
66,21,27,"Nothing unclean shall enter it, nor any one who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life."
66,22,1,"Then he showed me the river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,"
66,22,2,"through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."
66,22,3,"There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will serve him."
66,22,4,"They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads."
66,22,5,"And there will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light; and they will reign for ever and ever."
66,22,6,"And he said to me, »These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants the things which must soon take place.«"
66,22,7,"»And behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.«"
66,22,8,"I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me."
66,22,9,"But he said to me, »Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.«"
66,22,10,"And he said to me, »Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near."
66,22,11,"He who does wrong, let him do wrong still; and he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he who does right, let him do right still; and he who is holy, let him be holy still.«"
66,22,12,"»Behold, I am coming soon, and my reward is with me, to render to every man according to what he has done."
66,22,13,"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.«"
66,22,14,"Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city."
66,22,15,"Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood."
