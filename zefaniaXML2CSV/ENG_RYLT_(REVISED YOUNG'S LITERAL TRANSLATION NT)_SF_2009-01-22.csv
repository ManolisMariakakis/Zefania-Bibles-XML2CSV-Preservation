40,1,16,"and Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is named Christ."
40,1,17,"All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David"
40,1,18,"And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit,"
40,1,19,"and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to make her an example, did wish privately to send her away."
40,1,20,"And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, you may not fear to receive Mary your wife, for that which in her was conceived"
40,1,21,"and she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.'"
40,1,22,"And all this has come to pass, that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,"
40,1,23,"'Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,' which is, being interpreted 'With us"
40,1,24,"And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him, and received his wife,"
40,1,25,"and did not know her till she brought forth her son -- the first-born, and he called his name Jesus."
40,2,1,"And Jesus having been born in Beth-Lehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, lo, mages from the east came to Jerusalem,"
40,2,2,"saying, 'Where is he who was born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and we came to bow to him.'"
40,2,3,"And Herod the king having heard, was stirred, and all Jerusalem with him,"
40,2,4,"and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring from them where the Christ is born."
40,2,5,"And they said to him, 'In Beth-Lehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet,"
40,2,6,"And you, Beth-Lehem, the land of Judah, you are by no means the least among the leaders of Judah, for out of you shall come one leading, who shall feed My people Israel.'"
40,2,7,"Then Herod, privately having called the mages, did inquire exactly from them the time of the appearing star,"
40,2,8,"and having sent them to Beth-Lehem, he said, 'Having gone -- inquire you exactly for the child, and whenever you may have found, bring me back word, that I also having come may bow to him.'"
40,2,9,"And they, having heard the king, departed, and lo, the star, that they did see in the east, did go before them, till, having come, it stood over where the child was."
40,2,10,"And having seen the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy,"
40,2,11,"and having come to the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and having fallen down they bowed to him, and having opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh,"
40,2,12,"and having been divinely warned in a dream not to turn back unto Herod, through another way they withdrew to their own region."
40,2,13,"And on their having withdrawn, lo, a messenger of the Lord does appear in a dream to Joseph, saying, 'Having risen, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and be you there till I may speak to you, for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.'"
40,2,14,"And he, having risen, took the child and his mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt,"
40,2,15,"and he was there till the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 'Out of Egypt I did call My Son.'"
40,2,16,"Then Herod, having seen that he was deceived by the mages, was very enraged, and having sent forth, he murdered all the male children in Beth-Lehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time that he inquired exactly from the mages."
40,2,17,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,"
40,2,18,"'A voice in Ramah was heard -- lamentation and weeping and much mourning -- Rachel weeping"
40,2,19,"And Herod having died, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream does appear to Joseph in Egypt,"
40,2,20,"saying, 'Having risen, take the child and his mother, and be going to the land of Israel, for they have died -- those seeking the life of the child.'"
40,2,21,"And he, having risen, took the child and his mother, and came to the land of Israel,"
40,2,22,"and having heard that Archelaus does reign over Judea instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go there, and having been divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew to the parts of Galilee,"
40,2,23,"and coming, he dwelt in a city named Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophets, that 'A Nazarene he shall be called.'"
40,3,1,"And in those days comes John the Baptist, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea,"
40,3,2,"and saying, 'Reform, for come near has the reign of the heavens,'"
40,3,3,"for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, straight make you His paths.'"
40,3,4,"And this John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a girdle of skin round his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and honey of the field."
40,3,5,"Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,"
40,3,6,"and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins."
40,3,7,"And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming about his baptism, he said to them, 'Brood of vipers! Who did show you to flee from the coming wrath?"
40,3,8,"Bear, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation,"
40,3,9,"and do not think to say in yourselves, A father we have -- Abraham, for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham,"
40,3,10,"and now also, the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down, and to fire is cast."
40,3,11,"'I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation, but he who after me is coming is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals, he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,"
40,3,12,"whose fan"
40,3,13,"Then comes Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan, unto John to be baptized by him,"
40,3,14,"but John was forbidding him, saying, 'I have need by you to be baptized -- and you do come unto me!'"
40,3,15,"But Jesus answering said to him,"
40,3,16,"And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and lo, opened to him were the heavens, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him,"
40,3,17,"and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, 'This is My Son -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight.'"
40,4,1,"Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the Devil,"
40,4,2,"and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he did hunger."
40,4,3,"And the Tempter having come to him said, 'If Son you are of God -- speak that these stones may become loaves.'"
40,4,4,"But he answering said,"
40,4,5,"Then does the Devil take him to the"
40,4,6,"and said to him, 'If Son you are of God -- cast yourself down, for it has been written, that, His messengers He shall charge concerning you, and on hands they shall bear you up, that you may not dash on a stone your foot.'"
40,4,7,"Jesus said to him again,"
40,4,8,"Again does the Devil take him to a very high mount, and does show to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,"
40,4,9,"and said to him, 'All these to you I will give, if falling down you may bow to me.'"
40,4,10,"Then said Jesus to him,"
40,4,11,"Then does the Devil leave him, and lo, messengers came and were ministering to him."
40,4,12,"And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, did withdraw to Galilee,"
40,4,13,"and having left Nazareth, having come, he dwelt at Capernaum that is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtalim,"
40,4,14,"that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,"
40,4,15,"'Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations! --"
40,4,16,"The people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death -- light arose to them.'"
40,4,17,"From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say,"
40,4,18,"And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea -- for they were fishers --"
40,4,19,"and he said to them,"
40,4,20,"and they, immediately, having left the nets, did follow him."
40,4,21,"And having advanced from there, he saw other two brothers, James of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, refitting their nets, and he called them,"
40,4,22,"and they, immediately, having left the boat and their father, did follow him."
40,4,23,"And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people,"
40,4,24,"and his fame went forth to all Syria, and they brought to him all having ailments, pressed with manifold sicknesses and pains, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them."
40,4,25,"And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan."
40,5,1,"And having seen the multitudes, he went up to the mount, and he having sat down, his disciples came to him,"
40,5,2,"and having opened his mouth, he was teaching them, saying:"

40,27,6,"And the chief priests having taken the silverlings, said, 'It is not lawful to put them to the treasury, seeing it is the price of blood;'"
40,27,7,"and having taken counsel, they bought with them the field of the potter, for the burial of strangers;"
40,27,8,"therefore was that field called, 'Field of blood,' unto this day."

40,27,16,"and they had then a noted prisoner, called Barabbas,"

40,27,19,"And as he is sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent unto him, saying, 'Nothing -- to you and to that righteous one, for many things did I suffer to-day in a dream because of him.'"
40,27,20,"And the chief priests and the elders did persuade the multitudes that they might ask for themselves Barabbas, and might destroy Jesus;"
40,27,21,"and the governor answering said to them, 'Which of the two will you"
40,27,22,"Pilate said to them, 'What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?' They all say to him, 'Let be crucified!'"
40,27,23,"And the governor said, 'Why, what evil did he?' And they were crying out the more, saying, 'Let be crucified.'"
40,27,24,"And Pilate having seen that it profits nothing, but rather a tumult is made, having taken water, he did wash the hands before the multitude, saying, 'I am innocent from the blood of this righteous one; you -- you shall see;'"
40,27,25,"and all the people answering said, 'His blood"
40,27,26,"Then did he release to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered"
40,27,27,"Then the soldiers of the governor having taken Jesus to the Praetorium, did gather to him all the band;"
40,27,28,"and having unclothed him, they put around him a crimson cloak,"
40,27,29,"and having plaited him a crown out of thorns they put"
40,27,30,"And having spit on him, they took the reed, and were smiting on his head;"
40,27,31,"and when they had mocked him, they took off from him the cloak, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify"
40,27,32,"And coming forth, they found a man, a Cyrenian, by name Simon: him they impressed that he might bear his cross;"
40,27,33,"and having come to a place called Golgotha, that is called Place of a Skull,"
40,27,34,"they gave him to drink vinegar mixed with gall, and having tasted, he would not drink."
40,27,35,"And having crucified him, they divided his garments, casting a lot, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the prophet, 'They divided my garments to themselves, and over my vesture they cast a lot;'"
40,27,36,"and sitting down, they were watching him there,"
40,27,37,"and they put up over his head, his accusation written, 'This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.'"
40,27,38,"Then crucified with him are two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on the left,"
40,27,39,"and those passing by were speaking evil of him, wagging their heads,"
40,27,40,"and saying, 'You that are throwing down the sanctuary, and in three days building"
40,27,41,"And in like manner also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,"
40,27,42,"'Others he saved; himself he is not able to save! If he be King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe him;"
40,27,43,"he has trusted on God, let Him now deliver him, if He wish him, because he said -- Son of God I am;'"
40,27,44,"with the same also the robbers, who were crucified with him, were reproaching him."
40,27,45,"And from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land unto the ninth hour,"
40,27,46,"and about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a great voice, saying,"
40,27,47,"And certain of those standing there having heard, said -- 'Elijah he does call;'"
40,27,48,"and immediately, one of them having run, and having taken a spunge, having filled"
40,27,49,"but the rest said, 'Let alone, let us see if Elijah does come -- about to save him.'"
40,27,50,"And Jesus having again cried with a great voice, yielded the spirit;"
40,27,51,"and lo, the vail of the sanctuary was rent in two from top unto bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent,"
40,27,52,"and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who have fallen asleep, arose,"
40,27,53,"and having come forth out of the tombs after his rising, they went into the holy city, and appeared to many."
40,27,54,"And the centurion, and those with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were exceedingly afraid, saying, 'Truly this was God's Son.'"
40,27,55,"And there were there many women beholding from afar, who did follow Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,"
40,27,56,"among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and of Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee."
40,27,57,"And evening having come, there came a rich man, from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was discipled to Jesus,"
40,27,58,"he having gone near to Pilate, asked for himself the body of Jesus; then Pilate commanded the body to be given back."
40,27,59,"And having taken the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean linen,"
40,27,60,"and laid it in his new tomb, that he hewed in the rock, and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he went away;"
40,27,61,"and there were there Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the sepulchre."
40,27,62,"And on the morrow that is after the preparation, were gathered together the chief priests, and the Pharisees, unto Pilate,"
40,27,63,"saying, 'Sir, we have remembered that that deceiver said while yet living,"
40,27,64,"command, then, the sepulchre to be made secure till the third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, may steal him away, and may say to the people, He rose from the dead, and the last deceit shall be worse than the first.'"
40,27,65,"And Pilate said to them, 'You have a watch, go away, make secure -- as you have known;'"
40,27,66,"and they, having gone, did make the sepulchre secure, having sealed the stone, together with the watch."
40,28,1,"And on the eve of the sabbaths, at the dawn, toward the first of the sabbaths, came Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre,"
40,28,2,"and lo, there came a great earthquake, for a messenger of the Lord, having come down out of heaven, having come, did roll away the stone from the door, and was sitting upon it,"
40,28,3,"and his countenance was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow,"
40,28,4,"and from the fear of him did the keepers shake, and they became as dead men."

41,14,40,"and having returned, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy, and they had not known what they might answer him."
41,14,41,"And he comes the third time, and said to them,"
41,14,42,""
41,14,43,"And immediately -- while he is yet speaking -- comes near Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude, with swords and sticks, from the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;"
41,14,44,"and he who is delivering him up had given a token to them, saying, 'Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is, lay hold on him, and lead him away safely,'"
41,14,45,"and having come, immediately, having gone near him, he said, 'Rabbi, Rabbi,' and kissed him."
41,14,46,"And they laid on him their hands, and kept hold on him;"
41,14,47,"and a certain one of those standing by, having drawn the sword, struck the servant of the chief priest, and took off his ear."
41,14,48,"And Jesus answering said to them,"
41,14,49,""
41,14,50,"And having left him they all fled;"
41,14,51,"and a certain young man was following him, having put a linen cloth about"
41,14,52,"and he, having left the linen cloth, did flee from them naked."
41,14,53,"And they led away Jesus unto the chief priest, and come together to him do all the chief priests, and the elders, and the scribes;"
41,14,54,"and Peter afar off did follow him, to the inside of the hall of the chief priest, and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself near the fire."
41,14,55,"And the chief priests and all the sanhedrin were seeking against Jesus testimony -- to put him to death, and they were not finding,"
41,14,56,"for many were bearing false testimony against him, and their testimonies were not alike."
41,14,57,"And certain having risen up, were bearing false testimony against him, saying --"
41,14,58,"'We heard him saying -- I will throw down this sanctuary made with hands, and by three days, another made without hands I will build;'"
41,14,59,"and neither so was their testimony alike."
41,14,60,"And the chief priest, having risen up in the midst, questioned Jesus, saying, 'You do not answer anything! what do these testify against you?'"
41,14,61,"and he was keeping silent, and did not answer anything. Again the chief priest was questioning him, and said to him, 'Are you the Christ -- the Son of the Blessed?'"
41,14,62,"and Jesus said,"
41,14,63,"And the chief priest, having rent his garments, said, 'What need have we yet of witnesses?"
41,14,64,"You heard the evil speaking, what appears to you?' and they all condemned him to be worthy of death,"
41,14,65,"and certain began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, 'Prophesy;' and the officers were striking him with their palms."
41,14,66,"And Peter being in the hall beneath, there does come one of the maids of the chief priest,"
41,14,67,"and having seen Peter warming himself, having looked on him, she said, 'And you were with Jesus of Nazareth!'"
41,14,68,"and he denied, saying, 'I have not known"
41,14,69,"And the maid having seen him again, began to say to those standing near -- 'This is of them;'"
41,14,70,"and he was again denying. And after a little again, those standing near said to Peter, 'Truly you are of them, for you also are a Galilean, and your speech is alike;'"
41,14,71,"and he began to anathematize, and to swear -- 'I have not known this man of whom you speak;'"
41,14,72,"and a second time a cock crew, and Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him --"
41,15,1,"And immediately, in the morning, the chief priests having made a consultation, with the elders, and scribes, and the whole sanhedrin, having bound Jesus, did lead away, and delivered"
41,15,2,"and Pilate questioned him, 'Are you the king of the Jews?' and he answering said to him,"
41,15,3,"And the chief priests were accusing him of many things,"
41,15,4,"And Pilate again questioned him, saying, 'You do not answer anything! lo, how many things they do testify against you!'"
41,15,5,"and Jesus did no more answer anything, so that Pilate wondered."
41,15,6,"And at every feast he was releasing to them one prisoner, whomsoever they were asking;"
41,15,7,"and there was"
41,15,8,"And the multitude having cried out, began to ask for themselves as he was always doing to them,"
41,15,9,"and Pilate answered them, saying, 'Will you"
41,15,10,"for he knew that because of envy the chief priests had delivered him up;"
41,15,11,"and the chief priests did move the multitude, that he might rather release Barabbas to them."
41,15,12,"And Pilate answering, again said to them, 'What, then, will you"
41,15,13,"and they again cried out, 'Crucify him.'"
41,15,14,"And Pilate said to them, 'Why -- what evil did he?' and they cried out the more vehemently, 'Crucify him;'"
41,15,15,"and Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus -- having scourged"
41,15,16,"And the soldiers led him away into the hall, which is Praetorium, and call together the whole band,"
41,15,17,"and clothe him with purple, and having plaited a crown of thorns, they put"
41,15,18,"and began to salute him, 'Hail, King of the Jews.'"
41,15,19,"And they were smiting him on the head with a reed, and were spitting on him, and having bent the knee, were bowing to him,"
41,15,20,"and when they"
41,15,21,"And they impress a certain one passing by -- Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus -- that he may bear his cross,"
41,15,22,"and they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, 'Place of a skull;'"
41,15,23,"and they were giving him to drink wine mingled with myrrh, and he did not receive."
41,15,24,"And having crucified him, they were dividing his garments, casting a lot upon them, what each may take;"
41,15,25,"and it was the third hour, and they crucified him;"
41,15,26,"and the inscription of his accusation was written above -- 'The King of the Jews.'"
41,15,27,"And with him they crucify two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on his left,"
41,15,28,"and the Writing was fulfilled that is saying, 'And with lawless ones he was numbered.'"
41,15,29,"And those passing by were speaking evil of him, shaking their heads, and saying, 'Ah, the thrower down of the sanctuary, and in three days the builder!"
41,15,30,"save yourself, and come down from the cross!'"
41,15,31,"And in like manner also the chief priests, mocking with one another, with the scribes, said, 'Others he saved; himself he is not able to save."
41,15,32,"The Christ! the king of Israel -- let him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe;' and those crucified with him were reproaching him."
41,15,33,"And the sixth hour having come, darkness came over the whole land till the ninth hour,"
41,15,34,"and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice, saying,"
41,15,35,"And certain of those standing by, having heard, said, 'Lo, Elijah he does call;'"
41,15,36,"and one having run, and having filled a spunge with vinegar, having put"
41,15,37,"And Jesus having uttered a loud cry, yielded the spirit,"
41,15,38,"and the veil of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom,"
41,15,39,"and the centurion who was standing across from him, having seen that, having so cried out, he yielded the spirit, said, 'Truly this man was Son of God.'"
41,15,40,"And there were also women afar off beholding, among whom was also Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome,"
41,15,41,"(who also, when he was in Galilee, were following him, and were ministering to him,) and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem."
41,15,42,"And now evening having come, seeing it was the preparation, that is, the fore-sabbath,"
41,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathea, an honourable counsellor, who also himself was waiting for the reign of God, came, boldly entered in unto Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus."
41,15,44,"And Pilate wondered if he were already dead, and having called near the centurion, did question him if he were long dead,"
41,15,45,"and having known"
41,15,46,"And he, having brought fine linen, and having taken him down, wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that had been hewn out of a rock, and he rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre,"
41,15,47,"and Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of Joses, were beholding where he is laid."
41,16,1,"And the sabbath having past, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James, and Salome, bought spices, that having come, they may anoint him,"
41,16,2,"and early in the morning of the first of the sabbaths, they come unto the sepulchre, at the rising of the sun,"
41,16,3,"and they said among themselves, 'Who shall roll away for us the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?'"
41,16,4,"And having looked, they see that the stone has been rolled away -- for it was very great,"
41,16,5,"and having entered into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right hand, arrayed in a long white robe, and they were amazed."
41,16,6,"And he said to them, 'Be not amazed, you seek Jesus the Nazarene, the crucified: he did rise -- he is not here; lo, the place where they laid him!"
41,16,7,"and go, say to his disciples, and Peter, that he does go before you to Galilee; there you shall see him, as he said to you.'"
41,16,8,"And, having come forth quickly, they fled from the sepulchre, and trembling and amazement had seized them, and to no one said they anything, for they were afraid."
41,16,9,"And he, having risen in the morning of the first of the sabbaths, did appear first to Mary the Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons;"
41,16,10,"she having gone, told those who had been with him, mourning and weeping;"
41,16,11,"and they, having heard that he is alive, and was seen by her, did not believe."
41,16,12,"And after these things, to two of them, as they are going into a field, walking, he was manifested in another form,"
41,16,13,"and they having gone, told to the rest; not even them did they believe."
41,16,14,"Afterwards, as they are reclining (at meat), he was manifested to the eleven, and did reproach their unbelief and stiffness of heart, because they believed not those having seen him being raised;"
41,16,15,"and he said to them,"

41,16,19,"The Lord, then, indeed, after speaking to them, was received up to the heaven, and sat on the right hand of God;"
41,16,20,"and they, having gone forth, did preach everywhere, the Lord working with"
42,1,1,"Seeing that many did take in hand to set in order a narration of the matters that have been fully assured among us,"
42,1,2,"as they did deliver to us, who from the beginning became eye-witnesses, and officers of the Word, --"
42,1,3,"it seemed good also to me, having followed from the first after all things exactly, to write to you in order, most noble Theophilus,"
42,1,4,"that you may know the certainty of the things wherein you were instructed."
42,1,5,"There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Abijah, and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth;"
42,1,6,"and they were both righteous before God, going on in all the commands and righteousnesses of the Lord blameless,"
42,1,7,"and they had no child, because that Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in their days."
42,1,8,"And it came to pass, in his acting as priest, in the order of his course before God,"
42,1,9,"according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot was to make perfume, having gone into the sanctuary of the Lord,"
42,1,10,"and all the multitude of the people were praying without, at the hour of the perfume."
42,1,11,"And there appeared to him a messenger of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of the perfume,"
42,1,12,"and Zacharias, having seen, was troubled, and fear fell on him;"
42,1,13,"and the messenger said unto him, 'Fear not, Zacharias, for your supplication was heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear a son to you, and you shall call his name John,"
42,1,14,"and there shall be joy to you, and gladness, and many at his birth shall joy,"
42,1,15,"for he shall be great before the Lord, and wine and strong drink he may not drink, and of the Holy Spirit he shall be full, even from his mother's womb;"
42,1,16,"and many of the sons of Israel he shall turn to the Lord their God,"
42,1,17,"and he shall go before Him, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn hearts of fathers unto children, and disobedient ones to the wisdom of righteous ones, to make ready for the Lord, a people prepared.'"
42,1,18,"And Zacharias said unto the messenger, 'Whereby shall I know this? for I am aged, and my wife is advanced in her days?'"
42,1,19,"And the messenger answering said to him, 'I am Gabriel, who have been standing near before God, and I was sent to speak unto you, and to proclaim these good news to you,"
42,1,20,"and lo, you shall be silent, and not able to speak, till the day that these things shall come to pass, because you did not believe my words, that shall be fulfilled in their season.'"
42,1,21,"And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and wondering at his tarrying in the sanctuary,"
42,1,22,"and having come out, he was not able to speak to them, and they perceived that a vision he had seen in the sanctuary, and he was beckoning to them, and did remain dumb."
42,1,23,"And it came to pass, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he went away to his house,"
42,1,24,"and after those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying --"
42,1,25,"'Thus has the Lord done to me, in days in which He looked upon"
42,1,26,"And in the sixth month was the messenger Gabriel sent by God, to a city of Galilee, the name of which"
42,1,27,"to a virgin, betrothed to a man, whose name"
42,1,28,"And the messenger having come in unto her, said, 'Hail, favoured one, the Lord"
42,1,29,"and she, having seen, was troubled at his word, and was reasoning of what kind this salutation may be."
42,1,30,"And the messenger said to her, 'Fear not, Mary, for you have found favour with God;"
42,1,31,"and lo, you shall conceive in the womb, and shall bring forth a son, and call his name Jesus;"
42,1,32,"he shall be great, and Son of the Highest he shall be called, and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father,"
42,1,33,"and he shall reign over the house of Jacob to the ages; and of his reign there shall be no end.'"
42,1,34,"And Mary said unto the messenger, 'How shall this be, seeing a husband I do not know?'"
42,1,35,"And the messenger answering said to her, 'The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you, therefore also the holy-begotten thing shall be called Son of God;"
42,1,36,"and lo, Elizabeth, your kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her who was called barren;"
42,1,37,"because nothing shall be impossible with God.'"
42,1,38,"And Mary said, 'Lo, the maid-servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your saying,' and the messenger went away from her."
42,1,39,"And Mary having arisen in those days, went to the hill-country, with haste, to a city of Judea,"
42,1,40,"and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth."
42,1,41,"And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe did leap in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,"
42,1,42,"and spake out with a loud voice, and said, 'Blessed"
42,1,43,"and whence"
42,1,44,"for, lo, when the voice of your salutation came to my ears, leap in gladness did the babe in my womb;"
42,1,45,"and happy"
42,1,46,"And Mary said, 'My soul does magnify the Lord,"
42,1,47,"And my spirit was glad on God my Saviour,"
42,1,48,"Because He looked on the lowliness of His maid-servant, For, lo, henceforth call me happy shall all the generations,"
42,1,49,"For He who is mighty did to me great things, And holy"
42,1,50,"And His kindness"
42,1,51,"He did powerfully with His arm, He scattered abroad the proud in the thought of their heart,"
42,1,52,"He brought down the mighty from thrones, And He exalted the lowly,"
42,1,53,"The hungry He did fill with good, And the rich He sent away empty,"
42,1,54,"He received again Israel His servant, To remember kindness,"
42,1,55,"As He spake unto our fathers, To Abraham and to his seed -- to the age.'"
42,1,56,"And Mary remained with her about three months, and turned back to her house."
42,1,57,"And to Elizabeth was the time fulfilled for her bringing forth, and she bare a son,"
42,1,58,"and the neighbours and her kindred heard that the Lord was making His kindness great with her, and they were rejoicing with her."
42,1,59,"And it came to pass, on the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child, and they were calling him by the name of his father, Zacharias,"
42,1,60,"and his mother answering said, 'No, but he shall be called John.'"
42,1,61,"And they said unto her -- 'There is none among your kindred who is called by this name,'"
42,1,62,"and they were making signs to his father, what he would wish him to be called,"
42,1,63,"and having asked for a tablet, he wrote, saying, 'John is his name;' and they did all wonder;"
42,1,64,"and his mouth was opened presently, and his tongue, and he was speaking, praising God."
42,1,65,"And fear came upon all those dwelling around them, and in all the hill-country of Judea were all these sayings spoken of,"
42,1,66,"and all who heard did lay them up in their hearts, saying, 'What then shall this child be?' and the hand of the Lord was with him."
42,1,67,"And Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and did prophesy, saying,"
42,1,68,"'Blessed"
42,1,69,"And did raise an horn of salvation to us, In the house of David His servant,"
42,1,70,"As He spake by the mouth of His holy prophets, Which have been from the age;"
42,1,71,"Salvation from our enemies, And out of the hand of all hating us,"
42,1,72,"To do kindness with our fathers, And to be mindful of His holy covenant,"
42,1,73,"An oath that He sware to Abraham our father,"
42,1,74,"To give to us, without fear, Out of the hand of our enemies having been delivered,"
42,1,75,"To serve Him, in holiness and righteousness Before Him, all the days of our life."
42,1,76,"And you, child, Prophet of the Highest Shall you be called; For you shall go before the face of the Lord, To prepare His ways."
42,1,77,"To give knowledge of salvation to His people In remission of their sins,"
42,1,78,"Through the tender mercies of our God, In which the rising from on high did look upon us,"
42,1,79,"To give light to those sitting in darkness and death-shade, To guide our feet to a way of peace.'"
42,1,80,"And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and he was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel."
42,2,1,"And it came to pass in those days, there went forth a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world be enrolled --"
42,2,2,"this enrollment first came to pass when Cyrenius was governor of Syria --"
42,2,3,"and all were going to be enrolled, each to his proper city,"
42,2,4,"and Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, that is called Bethlehem, because of his being of the house and family of David,"
42,2,5,"to enroll himself with Mary his betrothed wife, being with child."
42,2,6,"And it came to pass, in their being there, the days were fulfilled for her bringing forth,"
42,2,7,"and she brought forth her son -- the first-born, and wrapped him up, and laid him down in the manger, because there was not for them a place in the guest-chamber."
42,2,8,"And there were shepherds in the same region, lodging in the field, and keeping the night-watches over their flock,"
42,2,9,"and lo, a messenger of the Lord stood over them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they feared a great fear."
42,2,10,"And the messenger said to them, 'Fear not, for lo, I bring you good news of great joy, that shall be to all the people --"
42,2,11,"because there was born to you to-day a Saviour -- who is Christ the Lord -- in the city of David,"
42,2,12,"and this"
42,2,13,"And suddenly there came with the messenger a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying,"
42,2,14,"'Glory in the highest to God, and upon earth peace, among men -- good will.'"
42,2,15,"And it came to pass, when the messengers were gone away from them to the heavens, that the men, the shepherds, said unto one another, 'We may go over indeed unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that has come to pass, that the Lord did make known to us.'"
42,2,16,"And they came, having hasted, and found both Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger,"
42,2,17,"and having seen, they made known abroad concerning the saying spoken to them concerning the child."
42,2,18,"And all who heard, did wonder concerning the things spoken by the shepherds unto them;"
42,2,19,"and Mary was preserving all these things, pondering in her heart;"
42,2,20,"and the shepherds turned back, glorifying and praising God, for all those things they heard and saw, as it was spoken unto them."
42,2,21,"And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise the child, then was his name called Jesus, having been so called by the messenger before his being conceived in the womb."
42,2,22,"And when the days of their purification were fulfilled, according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present to the Lord,"
42,2,23,"as it has been written in the Law of the Lord, -- 'Every male opening a womb shall be called holy to the Lord,'"
42,2,24,"and to give a sacrifice, according to that said in the Law of the Lord, 'A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons.'"
42,2,25,"And lo, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name"
42,2,26,"and it has been divinely told him by the Holy Spirit -- not to see death before he may see the Christ of the Lord."
42,2,27,"And he came in the Spirit to the temple, and in the parents bringing in the child Jesus, for their doing according to the custom of the law regarding him,"
42,2,28,"then he took him in his arms, and blessed God, and he said,"
42,2,29,"'Now You do send away Your servant, Lord, according to Your word, in peace,"
42,2,30,"because mine eyes did see Your salvation,"
42,2,31,"which You did prepare before the face of all the peoples,"
42,2,32,"a light to the uncovering of nations, and the glory of Your people Israel.'"
42,2,33,"And Joseph and his mother were wondering at the things spoken concerning him,"
42,2,34,"and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, 'Lo, this"
42,2,35,"(and also your own soul shall a sword pass through) -- that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.'"
42,2,36,"And there was Anna, a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, she was much advanced in days, having lived with an husband seven years from her virginity,"
42,2,37,"and she"
42,2,38,"and she, at that hour, having come in, was confessing, likewise, to the Lord, and was speaking concerning him, to all those looking for redemption in Jerusalem."
42,2,39,"And when they finished all things, according to the Law of the Lord, they turned back to Galilee, to their city Nazareth;"
42,2,40,"and the child grew and was strengthened in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him."
42,2,41,"And his parents were going yearly to Jerusalem, at the feast of the passover,"
42,2,42,"and when he became twelve years old, they having gone up to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast,"
42,2,43,"and having finished the days, in their returning the child Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother did not know,"
42,2,44,"and, having supposed him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and were seeking him among the kindred and among the acquaintances,"
42,2,45,"and not having found him, they turned back to Jerusalem seeking him."
42,2,46,"And it came to pass, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them,"
42,2,47,"and all those hearing him were astonished at his understanding and answers."
42,2,48,"And, having seen him, they were amazed, and his mother said unto him, 'Child, why did you thus to us? lo, your father and I, sorrowing, were seeking you.'"
42,2,49,"And he said unto them,"
42,2,50,"and they did not understand the saying that he spake to them,"
42,2,51,"and he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and he was subject to them, and his mother was keeping all these sayings in her heart,"
42,2,52,"and Jesus was advancing in wisdom, and in stature, and in favour with God and men."
42,3,1,"And in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar -- Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother, tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene --"
42,3,2,"Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests -- there came a word of God unto John the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness,"
42,3,3,"and he came to all the region round the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins,"
42,3,4,"as it has been written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, straight make you His paths;"
42,3,5,"every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall become straightness, and the rough become smooth ways;"
42,3,6,"and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.'"
42,3,7,"Then said he to the multitudes coming forth to be baptized by him, 'Brood of vipers! who did prompt you to flee from the coming wrath?"
42,3,8,"make, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have a father -- Abraham; for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham;"

43,1,19,"And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent out of Jerusalem priests and Levites, that they might question him, 'Who are you?'"
43,1,20,"and he confessed and did not deny, and confessed -- 'I am not the Christ.'"
43,1,21,"And they questioned him, 'What then? Elijah are you?' and he said, 'I am not.' -- 'The prophet are you?' and he answered, 'No.'"

43,1,27,"of whom I am not worthy that I may loose the cord of his sandal.'"
43,1,28,"These things came to pass in Bethabara, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing,"

43,1,31,"and I knew him not, but, that he might be manifested to Israel, because of this I came with the water baptizing."
43,1,32,"And John testified, saying -- 'I have seen the Spirit coming down, as a dove, out of heaven, and it remained on him;"
43,1,33,"and I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, He said to me, On whomsoever you mayest see the Spirit coming down, and remaining on him, this is he who is baptizing with the Holy Spirit;"
43,1,34,"and I have seen, and have testified, that this is the Son of God.'"
43,1,35,"On the morrow, again, John was standing, and two of his disciples,"
43,1,36,"and having looked on Jesus walking, he said, 'Lo, the Lamb of God;'"
43,1,37,"and the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus."
43,1,38,"And Jesus having turned, and having beheld them following, said to them,"

43,1,43,"On the morrow, he willed to go forth to Galilee, and he finds Philip, and said to him,"
43,1,44,"And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter;"

43,1,48,"Nathanael said to him, 'Whence me do you know?' Jesus answered and said to him,"
43,1,49,"Nathanael answered and said to him, 'Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are the king of Israel.'"
43,1,50,"Jesus answered and said to him,"
43,1,51,"and he said to him,"
43,2,1,"And the third day a marriage happened in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there,"
43,2,2,"and also Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage;"
43,2,3,"and wine having failed, the mother of Jesus said unto him, 'Wine they have not;'"
43,2,4,"Jesus said to her,"
43,2,5,"His mother said to the ministrants, 'Whatever he may say to you -- do.'"
43,2,6,"And there were there six water-jugs of stone, placed according to the purifying of the Jews, holding each two or three measures."
43,2,7,"Jesus said to them,"
43,2,8,"and he said to them,"
43,2,9,"And as the director of the apartment tasted the water become wine, and knew not whence it is, (but the ministrants knew, who have drawn the water,) the director of the feast does call the bridegroom,"
43,2,10,"and said to him, 'Every man, at first, the good wine does set forth; and when they may have drunk freely, then the inferior; you did keep the good wine till now.'"
43,2,11,"This beginning of the signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him;"
43,2,12,"after this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and there they remained not many days."
43,2,13,"And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,"
43,2,14,"and he found in the temple those selling oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the money-changers sitting,"
43,2,15,"and having made a whip of small cords, he put all forth out of the temple, also the sheep, and the oxen; and of the money-changers he poured out the coins, and the tables he overthrew,"
43,2,16,"and to those selling the doves he said,"
43,2,17,"And his disciples remembered that it is written, 'The zeal of Your house did eat me up;'"
43,2,18,"the Jews then answered and said to him, 'What sign do you show to us -- that you do these things?'"
43,2,19,"Jesus answered and said to them,"
43,2,20,"The Jews, therefore, said, 'Forty and six years was this sanctuary building, and will you in three days raise it up?'"
43,2,21,"but he spake concerning the sanctuary of his body;"
43,2,22,"when, then, he was raised out of the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this to them, and they believed the Writing, and the word that Jesus said."
43,2,23,"And as he was in Jerusalem, in the passover, in the feast, many believed in his name, beholding his signs that he was doing;"

43,5,7,"The ailing man answered him, 'Sir, I have no man, that, when the water may be troubled, he may put me into the pool, and while I am coming, another does go down before me.'"
43,5,8,"Jesus said to him,"
43,5,9,"and immediately the man became whole, and he took up his couch, and was walking, and it was a sabbath on that day,"
43,5,10,"the Jews then said to him that has been healed, 'It is a sabbath; it is not lawful to you to take up the couch.'"

43,18,26,"One of the servants of the chief priest, being kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, said, 'Did not I see you in the garden with him?'"

43,18,28,"They led, therefore, Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium, and it was early, and they themselves did not enter into the praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the passover;"
43,18,29,"Pilate, therefore, went forth unto them, and said, 'What accusation do you bring against this man?'"
43,18,30,"they answered and said to him, 'If he were not an evil doer, we had not delivered him to you.'"
43,18,31,"Pilate, therefore, said to them, 'Take you him -- you -- and according to your law judge him;' the Jews, therefore, said to him, 'It is not lawful to us to put any one to death;'"

43,18,33,"Pilate, therefore, entered into the praetorium again, and called Jesus, and said to him, 'You are the King of the Jews?'"
43,18,34,"Jesus answered him,"
43,18,35,"Pilate answered, 'Am I a Jew? your nation, and the chief priests did deliver you up to me; what did you?'"
43,18,36,"Jesus answered,"
43,18,37,"Pilate, therefore, said to him, 'Art you then a king?' Jesus answered,"
43,18,38,"Pilate said to him, 'What is truth?' and this having said, again he went forth unto the Jews, and said to them, 'I do find no fault in him;"
43,18,39,"and you have a custom that I shall release to you one in the passover; will you, therefore,"
43,18,40,"therefore they all cried out again, saying, 'Not this one -- but Barabbas;' and Barabbas was a robber."
43,19,1,"Then, therefore, did Pilate take Jesus and scourge"
43,19,2,"and the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns, did place"
43,19,3,"and said, 'Hail! the king of the Jews;' and they were giving him slaps."
43,19,4,"Pilate, therefore, again went forth without, and said to them, 'Lo, I do bring him to you without, that you may know that in him I find no fault;'"
43,19,5,"Jesus, therefore, came forth without, bearing the thorny crown and the purple garment; and he said to them, 'Lo, the man!'"
43,19,6,"When, therefore, the chief priests and the officers did see him, they cried out, saying, 'Crucify, crucify;' Pilate said to them, 'Take you him -- you, and crucify; for I find no fault in him;'"
43,19,7,"the Jews answered him, 'We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, for he made himself Son of God.'"
43,19,8,"When, therefore, Pilate heard this word, he was the more afraid,"
43,19,9,"and entered again to the praetorium, and said to Jesus, 'Whence are you?' and Jesus gave him no answer."
43,19,10,"Pilate, therefore, said to him, 'To me do you not speak? Have you not known that I have authority to crucify you, and I have authority to release you?'"
43,19,11,"Jesus answered,"
43,19,12,"From this"
43,19,13,"Pilate, therefore, having heard this word, brought Jesus without -- and he sat down upon the tribunal -- to a place called, 'Pavement,' and in Hebrew, Gabbatha;"
43,19,14,"and it was the preparation of the passover, and as it were the sixth hour, and he said to the Jews, 'Lo, your king!'"
43,19,15,"and they cried out, 'Take away, take away, crucify him;' Pilate said to them, 'Your king shall I crucify?' the chief priests answered, 'We have no king except Caesar.'"
43,19,16,"Then, therefore, he delivered him up to them, that he may be crucified, and they took Jesus and led"
43,19,17,"and bearing his cross, he went forth to the place called"
43,19,18,"where they crucified him, and with him two others, on this side, and on that side, and Jesus in the midst."
43,19,19,"And Pilate also wrote a title, and put"
43,19,20,"this title, therefore, read many of the Jews, because the place was near to the city where Jesus was crucified, and it was having been written in Hebrew, in Greek, in Roman."
43,19,21,"The chief priests of the Jews said, therefore, to Pilate, 'Write not -- The king of the Jews, but that one said, I am king of the Jews;'"
43,19,22,"Pilate answered, 'What I have written, I have written.'"
43,19,23,"The soldiers, therefore, when they did crucify Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, also the coat, and the coat was seamless, from the top woven throughout,"
43,19,24,"they said, therefore, to one another, 'We may not rend it, but cast a lot for it, whose it shall be;' that the Writing might be fulfilled, that is saying, 'They divided my garments to themselves, and upon my raiment they did cast a lot;' the soldiers, therefore, indeed, did these things."
43,19,25,"And there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleopas, and Mary the Magdalene;"
43,19,26,"Jesus, therefore, having seen"
43,19,27,"afterward he said to the disciple,"
43,19,28,"After this, Jesus knowing that all things now have been finished, that the Writing may be fulfilled, said,"
43,19,29,"a vessel, therefore, was placed full of vinegar, and they having filled a sponge with vinegar, and having put"
43,19,30,"when, therefore, Jesus received the vinegar, he said,"
43,19,31,"The Jews, therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, since it was the preparation, (for that sabbath day was a great one,) asked of Pilate that their legs may be broken, and they taken away."
43,19,32,"The soldiers, therefore, came, and of the first indeed they did break the legs, and of the other who was crucified with him,"
43,19,33,"and having come to Jesus, when they saw him already having been dead, they did not break his legs;"
43,19,34,"but one of the soldiers with a spear did pierce his side, and immediately there came forth blood and water;"
43,19,35,"and he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true, and that one has known that true things he speaks, that you also may believe."
43,19,36,"For these things came to pass, that the Writing may be fulfilled, 'A bone of him shall not be broken;'"
43,19,37,"and again another Writing said, 'They shall look to him whom they did pierce.'"
43,19,38,"And after these things did Joseph of Arimathea -- being a disciple of Jesus, but concealed, through the fear of the Jews -- ask of Pilate, that he may take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave leave; he came, therefore, and took away the body of Jesus,"
43,19,39,"and Nicodemus also came -- who came unto Jesus by night at the first -- bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, as it were, a hundred pounds."
43,19,40,"They took, therefore, the body of Jesus, and bound it with linen clothes with the spices, according as it was the custom of the Jews to prepare for burial;"
43,19,41,"and there was in the place where he was crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one was yet laid;"
43,19,42,"there, therefore, because of the preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus."
43,20,1,"And on the first of the sabbaths, Mary the Magdalene does come early (there being yet darkness) to the tomb, and she sees the stone having been taken away out of the tomb,"
43,20,2,"she runs, therefore, and comes unto Simon Peter, and unto the other disciple whom Jesus was loving, and said to them, 'They took away the Lord out of the tomb, and we have not known where they laid him.'"
43,20,3,"Peter, therefore, went forth, and the other disciple, and they were coming to the tomb,"
43,20,4,"and the two were running together, and the other disciple did run forward more quickly than Peter, and came first to the tomb,"
43,20,5,"and having stooped down, sees the linen clothes lying, yet, indeed, he entered not."
43,20,6,"Simon Peter, therefore, comes, following him, and he entered into the tomb, and beholds the linen clothes lying,"
43,20,7,"and the napkin that was upon his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but apart, having been folded up, in one place;"
43,20,8,"then, therefore, entered also the other disciple who came first unto the tomb, and he saw, and did believe;"
43,20,9,"for not yet did they know the Writing, that it behooves him out of the dead to rise again."
43,20,10,"The disciples therefore went away again unto their own friends,"
43,20,11,"and Mary was standing near the tomb, weeping without; as she was weeping, then, she stooped down to the tomb, and beholds two messengers in white, sitting,"
43,20,12,"one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid."
43,20,13,"And they say to her, 'Woman, why do you weep?' she said to them, 'Because they took away my Lord, and I have not known where they laid him;'"
43,20,14,"and these things having said, she turned backward, and sees Jesus standing, and she had not known that it is Jesus."

43,20,18,"Mary the Magdalene comes, telling to the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and"
43,20,19,"It being, therefore, evening, on that day, the first of the sabbaths, and the doors having been shut where the disciples were assembled, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them,"
43,20,20,"and this having said, he showed them his hands and side; the disciples, therefore, rejoiced, having seen the Lord."
43,20,21,"Jesus, therefore, said to them again,"
43,20,22,"and this having said, he breathed on"
43,20,23,""
43,20,24,"And Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came;"
43,20,25,"the other disciples, therefore, said to him, 'We have seen the Lord;' and he said to them, 'If I may not see in his hands the mark of the nails, and may put my finger to the mark of the nails, and may put my hand to his side, I will not believe.'"
43,20,26,"And after eight days, again were his disciples within, and Thomas with them; Jesus comes, the doors having been shut, and he stood in the midst, and said,"
43,20,27,"then he said to Thomas,"
43,20,28,"And Thomas answered and said to him, 'My Lord and my God;'"

43,20,30,"Many indeed, therefore, other signs also did Jesus before his disciples, that are not written in this book;"
43,20,31,"and these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.'"
43,21,1,"After these things did Jesus manifest himself again to the disciples on the sea of Tiberias, and he did manifest himself thus:"
43,21,2,"There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas who is called Didymus, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee, and the"
43,21,3,"Simon Peter said to them, 'I go away to fish;' they say to him, 'We go -- we also -- with you;' they went forth and entered into the boat immediately, and on that night they caught nothing."
43,21,4,"And morning being now come, Jesus stood at the shore, yet indeed the disciples did not know that it is Jesus;"
43,21,5,"Jesus, therefore, said to them,"
43,21,6,"they answered him, 'No;' and he said to them,"
43,21,7,"That disciple, therefore, whom Jesus was loving said to Peter, 'The Lord it is!' Simon Peter, therefore, having heard that it is the Lord, did gird on the outer coat, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea;"
43,21,8,"and the other disciples came by the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but as it were about two hundred cubits off, dragging the net of the fishes;"
43,21,9,"when, therefore, they came to the land, they behold a fire of coals lying, and a fish lying on it, and bread."
43,21,10,"Jesus said to them,"
43,21,11,"Simon Peter went up, and drew the net up on the land, full of great fishes, an hundred fifty and three, and though they were so many, the net was not rent."
43,21,12,"Jesus said to them,"
43,21,13,"Jesus, therefore, does come and take the bread and give to them, and the fish in like manner;"
43,21,14,"this"
43,21,15,"When, therefore, they dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter,"

43,21,17,"He said to him the third time,"
43,21,18,""
43,21,19,"and this he said, signifying by what death he shall glorify God; and having said this, he said to him,"
43,21,20,"And Peter having turned about does see the disciple whom Jesus was loving following, (who also reclined in the supper on his breast, and said, 'Sir, who is he who is delivering you up?')"
43,21,21,"Peter having seen this one, said to Jesus, 'Lord, and what of this one?'"
43,21,22,"Jesus said to him,"
43,21,23,"yet Jesus did not say to him, that he does not die, but,"
43,21,24,"this is the disciple who is testifying concerning these things, and he wrote these things, and we have known that his testimony is true."
43,21,25,"And there are also many other things -- as many as Jesus did -- which, if they may be written one by one, not even the world itself I think to have place for the books written. Amen."
44,1,1,"The former account, indeed, I made concerning all things, O Theophilus, that Jesus began both to do and to teach,"
44,1,2,"till the day in which, having given command, through the Holy Spirit, to the apostles whom he did choose out, he was taken up,"
44,1,3,"to whom also he did present himself alive after his suffering, in many certain proofs, through forty days being seen by them, and speaking the things concerning the reign of God."
44,1,4,"And being assembled together with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which,"
44,1,5,""
44,1,6,"They, therefore, indeed, having come together, were questioning him, saying, 'Lord, do you at this time restore the reign to Israel?'"

44,1,9,"And these things having said -- they beholding -- he was taken up, and a cloud did receive him up from their sight;"
44,1,10,"and as they were looking stedfastly to the heaven in his going on, then, lo, two men stood by them in white apparel,"
44,1,11,"who also said, 'Men, Galileans, why do you stand gazing into the heaven? this Jesus who was received up from you into the heaven, shall so come in what manner you saw him going on to the heaven.'"
44,1,12,"Then did they return to Jerusalem from the mount that is called of Olives, that is near Jerusalem, a sabbath's journey;"
44,1,13,"and when they came in, they went up to the upper room, where were abiding both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James, of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zelotes, and Judas, of James;"
44,1,14,"these all were continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication, with women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren."
44,1,15,"And in these days, Peter having risen up in the midst of the disciples, said, (the multitude also of the names at the same place was, as it were, an hundred and twenty,)"
44,1,16,"'Men, brethren, it behoved this Writing that it be fulfilled that beforehand the Holy Spirit spake through the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who became guide to those who took Jesus,"
44,1,17,"because he was numbered among us, and did receive the share in this ministration,"
44,1,18,"this one, indeed, then, purchased a field out of the reward of unrighteousness, and falling headlong, burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed forth,"
44,1,19,"and it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem, insomuch that that place is called, in their proper dialect, Aceldama, that is, field of blood,"
44,1,20,"for it has been written in the book of Psalms: Let his lodging-place become desolate, and let no one be dwelling in it, and his oversight let another take."
44,1,21,"'It behooves, therefore, of the men who did go with us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,"
44,1,22,"beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day in which he was received up from us, one of these to become with us a witness of his rising again.'"
44,1,23,"And they set two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias,"
44,1,24,"and having prayed, they said, 'You, Lord, who are knowing the heart of all, show which one you did choose of these two"
44,1,25,"to receive the share of this ministration and apostleship, from which Judas, by transgression, did fall, to go on to his proper place;'"
44,1,26,"and they gave their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles."
44,2,1,"And in the day of the Pentecost being fulfilled, they were all with one accord at the same place,"
44,2,2,"and there came suddenly out of the heaven a sound as of a bearing violent breath, and it filled all the house where they were sitting,"
44,2,3,"and there appeared to them divided tongues, as it were of fire; it sat also upon each one of them,"
44,2,4,"and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, according as the Spirit was giving them to declare."
44,2,5,"And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation of those under the heaven,"
44,2,6,"and the rumour of this having come, the multitude came together, and was confounded, because they were each one hearing them speaking in his proper dialect,"
44,2,7,"and they were all amazed, and did wonder, saying one unto another, 'Lo, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?"
44,2,8,"and how do we hear, each in our proper dialect, in which we were born?"
44,2,9,"Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, in Judea also, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,"

44,2,11,"Cretes and Arabians, we did hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.'"
44,2,12,"And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one unto another, 'What would this wish to be?'"
44,2,13,"and others mocking said, -- 'They are full of sweet wine;'"
44,2,14,"and Peter having stood up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and declared to them, 'Men, Jews! and all those dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and hearken to my sayings,"
44,2,15,"for these are not drunken, as you take it up, for it is the third hour of the day."
44,2,16,"'But this is that which has been spoken through the prophet Joel:"
44,2,17,"And it shall be in the last days, said God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;"
44,2,18,"and also upon My men-servants, and upon My maid-servants, in those days, I will pour out of My Spirit, and they shall prophesy;"
44,2,19,"and I will give wonders in the heaven above, and signs upon the earth beneath -- blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke,"
44,2,20,"the sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the coming of the day of the Lord -- the great and illustrious;"
44,2,21,"and it shall be, every one -- whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be saved."
44,2,22,"'Men, Israelites! hear these words, Jesus the Nazarene, a man approved of God among you by mighty works, and wonders, and signs, that God did through him in the midst of you, according as also you yourselves have known;"
44,2,23,"this one, by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, being given out, having taken by lawless hands, having crucified -- you did slay;"
44,2,24,"whom God did raise up, having loosed the pains of the death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it,"
44,2,25,"for David said in regard to him: I foresaw the Lord always before me -- because He is on my right hand -- that I may not be moved;"
44,2,26,"because of this was my heart cheered, and my tongue was glad, and yet -- my flesh also shall rest on hope,"
44,2,27,"because You will not leave my soul to hades, nor will You give Your Kind One to see corruption;"
44,2,28,"You did make known to me ways of life, You shall fill me with joy with Your countenance."
44,2,29,"'Men, brethren! it is permitted to speak with freedom unto you concerning the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is among us unto this day;"
44,2,30,"a prophet, therefore, being, and knowing that with an oath God did swear to him, out of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, to raise up the Christ, to sit upon his throne,"
44,2,31,"having foreseen, he did speak concerning the rising again of the Christ, that his soul was not left to hades, nor did his flesh see corruption."
44,2,32,"'This Jesus did God raise up, of which we are all witnesses;"
44,2,33,"at the right hand then of God having been exalted -- also the promise of the Holy Spirit having received from the Father -- he was shedding forth this, which now you see and hear;"
44,2,34,"for David did not go up to the heavens, and he said himself: The Lord said to my lord, Sit you at my right hand,"
44,2,35,"till I make your foes your footstool;"
44,2,36,"assuredly, therefore, let all the house of Israel know, that both Lord and Christ did God make him -- this Jesus whom you did crucify.'"
44,2,37,"And having heard, they were pricked to the heart; they say also to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, 'What shall we do, men, brethren?'"
44,2,38,"and Peter said unto them, 'Reform, and be baptized each of you on the name of Jesus Christ, to remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit,"
44,2,39,"for to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all those afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.'"
44,2,40,"Also with many more other words he was testifying and exhorting, saying, 'Be saved from this perverse generation;'"
44,2,41,"then those, indeed, who did gladly receive his word were baptized, and there were added on that day, as it were, three thousand souls,"
44,2,42,"and they were continuing stedfastly in the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of the bread, and the prayers."
44,2,43,"And fear came on every soul, many wonders also and signs were being done through the apostles,"
44,2,44,"and all those believing were at the same place, and had all things common,"
44,2,45,"and the possessions and the goods they were selling, and were parting them to all, according as any one had need."
44,2,46,"Daily also continuing with one accord in the temple, breaking also at every house bread, they were partaking of food in gladness and simplicity of heart,"
44,2,47,"praising God, and having favour with all the people, and the Lord was adding those being saved every day to the assembly."
44,3,1,"And Peter and John were going up at the same time to the temple, at the hour of the prayer, the ninth"
44,3,2,"and a certain man, being lame from the womb of his mother, was being carried, whom they were laying every day at the gate of the temple, called Beautiful, to ask a kindness from those entering into the temple,"
44,3,3,"who, having seen Peter and John about to go into the temple, was begging to receive a kindness."
44,3,4,"And Peter, having looked stedfastly toward him with John, said, 'Look toward us;'"
44,3,5,"and he was giving heed to them, looking to receive something from them;"
44,3,6,"and Peter said, 'Silver and gold I have none, but what I have, that I give to you; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and be walking.'"
44,3,7,"And having seized him by the right hand, he raised"
44,3,8,"and springing up, he stood, and was walking, and did enter with them into the temple, walking and springing, and praising God;"
44,3,9,"and all the people saw him walking and praising God,"
44,3,10,"they were knowing him also that this it was who for a kindness was sitting at the Beautiful gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what has happened to him."
44,3,11,"And at the lame man who was healed holding Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch called Solomon's -- greatly amazed,"
44,3,12,"and Peter having seen, answered unto the people, 'Men, Israelites! why wonder you at this? or on us why look you so earnestly, as if by our own power or piety we have made him to walk?"
44,3,13,"'The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, did glorify His child Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, he having given judgment to release"
44,3,14,"and you the Holy and Righteous One did deny, and desired a man -- a murderer -- to be granted to you,"
44,3,15,"and the Prince of the life you did kill, whom God did raise out of the dead, of which we are witnesses;"
44,3,16,"and on the faith of his name, this one whom you see and have known, his name made strong, even the faith that"
44,3,17,"'And now, brethren, I have known that through ignorance you did"
44,3,18,"and God, what things before He had declared through the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ should suffer, He did thus fulfil;"
44,3,19,"reform you, therefore, and turn back, for your sins being blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,"
44,3,20,"and He may send Jesus Christ who before has been preached to you,"
44,3,21,"whom it behooves heaven, indeed, to receive till times of a restitution of all things, of which God spake through the mouth of all His holy prophets from the age."
44,3,22,"'For Moses, indeed, unto the fathers said -- A prophet to you shall the Lord your God raise up out of your brethren, like to me; him shall you hear in all things, as many as he may speak unto you;"
44,3,23,"and it shall be, every soul that may not hear that prophet shall be utterly destroyed out of the people;"
44,3,24,"and also all the prophets from Samuel and those following in order, as many as spake, did also foretell of these days."
44,3,25,"'You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made unto our fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in your seed shall be blessed all the families of the earth;"
44,3,26,"to you first, God, having raised up His child Jesus, did send him, blessing you, in the turning away of each one from your evil ways.'"
44,4,1,"And as they are speaking unto the people, there came to them the priests, and the magistrate of the temple, and the Sadducees --"
44,4,2,"being grieved because of their teaching the people, and preaching in Jesus the rising again out of the dead --"
44,4,3,"and they laid hands upon them, and did put them in custody unto the morrow, for it was evening already;"
44,4,4,"and many of those hearing the word did believe, and the number of the men became, as it were, five thousand."
44,4,5,"And it came to pass upon the morrow, there were gathered together of them the rulers, and elders, and scribes, to Jerusalem,"
44,4,6,"and Annas the chief priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the chief priest,"
44,4,7,"and having set them in the midst, they were inquiring, 'In what power, or in what name did you do this?'"
44,4,8,"Then Peter, having been filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them: 'Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,"
44,4,9,"if we to-day are examined concerning the good deed to the ailing man, by whom he has been saved,"
44,4,10,"be it known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you did crucify, whom God did raise out of the dead, in him has this one stood by before you whole."
44,4,11,"'This is the stone that was set at nought by you -- the builders, that became head of a corner;"
44,4,12,"and there is not salvation in any other, for there is no other name under the heaven that has been given among men, in which it behooves us to be saved.'"
44,4,13,"And beholding the openness of Peter and John, and having perceived that they are men unlettered and plebeian, they were wondering -- they were taking knowledge also of them that with Jesus they had been --"
44,4,14,"and seeing the man standing with them who has been healed, they had nothing to say against"
44,4,15,"and having commanded them to go away out of the sanhedrin, they took counsel with one another,"
44,4,16,"saying, 'What shall we do to these men? because that, indeed, a notable sign has been done through them, to all those dwelling in Jerusalem"
44,4,17,"but that it may spread no further toward the people, let us strictly threaten them no more to speak in this name to any man.'"
44,4,18,"And having called them, they charged them not to speak at all, nor to teach, in the name of Jesus,"
44,4,19,"and Peter and John answering unto them said, 'Whether it is righteous before God to hearken to you rather than to God, judge you;"
44,4,20,"for we cannot but speak what we did see and hear.'"
44,4,21,"And they having further threatened"
44,4,22,"for above forty years of age was the man upon whom had been done this sign of the healing."
44,4,23,"And being let go, they went unto their own friends, and declared whatever the chief priests and the elders said unto them,"
44,4,24,"and they having heard, with one accord did lift up the voice unto God, and said, 'Lord, you"
44,4,25,"who, through the mouth of David your servant, did say, Why did nations rage, and peoples meditate vain things?"
44,4,26,"the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ;"
44,4,27,"for gathered together of a truth against Your holy child Jesus, whom You did anoint, were both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with nations and peoples of Israel,"
44,4,28,"to do whatever Your hand and Your counsel did determine before to come to pass."
44,4,29,"'And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and grant to Your servants with all freedom to speak Your word,"
44,4,30,"in the stretching forth of Your hand, for healing, and signs, and wonders, to come to pass through the name of Your holy child Jesus.'"
44,4,31,"And they having prayed, the place was shaken in which they were gathered together, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and were speaking the word of God with freedom,"
44,4,32,"and of the multitude of those who did believe the heart and the soul was one, and not one was saying that anything of the things he had was his own, but all things were to them in common."
44,4,33,"And with great power were the apostles giving the testimony to the rising again of the Lord Jesus, great grace also was on them all,"
44,4,34,"for there was not any one among them who did lack, for as many as were possessors of fields, or houses, selling"
44,4,35,"and were laying them at the feet of the apostles, and distribution was being made to each according as any one had need."
44,4,36,"And Joses, who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas -- which is, having been interpreted, Son of Comfort -- a Levite, of Cyprus by birth,"
44,4,37,"a field being his, having sold"
44,5,1,"And a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,"
44,5,2,"and did keep back of the price -- his wife also knowing -- and having brought a certain part, at the feet of the apostles he laid"
44,5,3,"And Peter said, 'Ananias, therefore did the Adversary fill your heart, for you to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back of the price of the place?"
44,5,4,"while it remained, did it not remain yours? and having been sold, in your authority was it not? why"
44,5,5,"and Ananias hearing these words, having fallen down, did expire, and great fear came upon all who heard these things,"
44,5,6,"and having risen, the younger men wound him up, and having carried forth, they buried"
44,5,7,"And it came to pass, about three hours after, that his wife, not knowing what has happened, came in,"
44,5,8,"and Peter answered her, 'Tell me if for so much you sold the place;' and she said, 'Yes, for so much.'"
44,5,9,"And Peter said unto her, 'How was it agreed by you, to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? lo, the feet of those who did bury your husband"
44,5,10,"and she fell down presently at his feet, and expired, and the young men having come in, found her dead, and having carried forth, they buried"
44,5,11,"and great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who heard these things."
44,5,12,"And through the hands of the apostles came many signs and wonders among the people, and they were with one accord all in the porch of Solomon;"
44,5,13,"and of the rest no one was daring to join himself to them, but the people were magnifying them,"
44,5,14,"(and the more were believers added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women,)"
44,5,15,"so as into the broad places to bring forth the ailing, and to lay"
44,5,16,"and there were coming together also the people of the cities round about to Jerusalem, bearing ailing persons, and those harassed by unclean spirits -- who were all healed."
44,5,17,"And having risen, the chief priest, and all those with him -- being the sect of the Sadducees -- were filled with zeal,"
44,5,18,"and laid their hands upon the apostles, and did put them in a public prison;"
44,5,19,"and a messenger of the Lord through the night opened the doors of the prison, having also brought them forth, he said,"
44,5,20,"'Go on, and standing, speak in the temple to the people all the sayings of this life;'"
44,5,21,"and having heard, they did enter at the dawn into the temple, and were teaching. And the chief priest having come, and those with him, they called together the sanhedrin and all the senate of the sons of Israel, and they sent to the prison to have them brought,"
44,5,22,"and the officers having come, did not find them in the prison, and having turned back, they told,"
44,5,23,"saying -- 'The prison indeed we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors, and having opened -- within we found no one.'"
44,5,24,"And as the priest, and the magistrate of the temple, and the chief priests, heard these words, they were doubting concerning them to what this would come;"
44,5,25,"and coming near, a certain one told them, saying -- 'Lo, the men whom you did put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people;'"
44,5,26,"then the magistrate having gone away with officers, brought them without violence, for they were fearing the people, lest they should be stoned;"
44,5,27,"and having brought them, they set"
44,5,28,"saying, 'Did not we strictly command you not to teach in this name? and lo, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring upon us the blood of this man.'"
44,5,29,"And Peter and the apostles answering, said, 'To obey God it behooves, rather than men;"
44,5,30,"and the God of our fathers did raise up Jesus, whom you slew, having hanged upon a tree;"
44,5,31,"this one God, a Prince and a Saviour, has exalted with His right hand, to give reformation to Israel, and forgiveness of sins;"
44,5,32,"and we are His witnesses of these sayings, and the Holy Spirit also, whom God gave to those obeying him.'"
44,5,33,"And they having heard, were cut"
44,5,34,"but a certain one, having risen up in the sanhedrin -- a Pharisee, by name Gamaliel, a teacher of law honoured by all the people -- commanded to put the apostles forth a little,"
44,5,35,"and said unto them, 'Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves about these men, what you are about to do,"
44,5,36,"for before these days rose up Theudas, saying, that himself was some one, to whom a number of men did join themselves, as it were four hundred, who was slain, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered, and came to nought."
44,5,37,"'After this one rose up, Judas the Galilean, in the days of the enrollment, and drew away much people after him, and that one perished, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered;"
44,5,38,"and now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone, because if this counsel or this work may be of men, it will be overthrown,"
44,5,39,"and if it be of God, you are not able to overthrow it, lest perhaps also you be found fighting against God.'"
44,5,40,"And to him they agreed, and having called near the apostles, having beaten"
44,5,41,"they, indeed, then, departed from the presence of the sanhedrin, rejoicing that for his name they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour,"
44,5,42,"every day also in the temple, and in every house, they were not ceasing teaching and proclaiming good news -- Jesus the Christ."
44,6,1,"And in these days, the disciples multiplying, there came a murmuring of the Hellenists at the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily ministration,"
44,6,2,"and the twelve, having called near the multitude of the disciples, said, 'It is not pleasing that we, having left the word of God, do minister at tables;"
44,6,3,"look out, therefore, brethren, seven men of you who are well testified of, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may set over this necessity,"
44,6,4,"and we to prayer, and to the ministration of the word, will give ourselves continually.'"
44,6,5,"And the thing was pleasing before all the multitude, and they did choose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch,"
44,6,6,"whom they did set before the apostles, and they, having prayed, laid on them"
44,6,7,"And the word of God did increase, and the number of the disciples did multiply in Jerusalem exceedingly; a great multitude also of the priests were obedient to the faith."
44,6,8,"And Stephen, full of faith and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people,"
44,6,9,"and there arose certain of those of the synagogue, called of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia, and Asia, disputing with Stephen,"
44,6,10,"and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking;"
44,6,11,"then they suborned men, saying -- 'We have heard him speaking evil sayings in regard to Moses and God.'"
44,6,12,"They did stir up also the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and having come upon"
44,6,13,"they set up also false witnesses, saying, 'This one does not cease to speak evil sayings against this holy place and the law,"
44,6,14,"for we have heard him saying, That this Jesus the Nazarean shall overthrow this place, and shall change the customs that Moses delivered to us;'"
44,6,15,"and gazing at him, all those sitting in the sanhedrin saw his face as it were the face of a messenger."
44,7,1,"And the chief priest said, 'Are then these things so?'"
44,7,2,"and he said, 'Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken: The God of the glory did appear to our father Abraham, being in Mesopotamia, before his dwelling in Haran,"
44,7,3,"and He said to him, Go forth out of your land, and out of your kindred, and come to a land that I shall show you."
44,7,4,"'Then having come forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Haran, and from thence, after the death of his father, He did remove him to this land wherein you now dwell,"
44,7,5,"and He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a footstep, and did promise to give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him -- he having no child."
44,7,6,"'And God spake thus, That his seed shall be sojourning in a strange land, and they shall cause it to serve, and shall do it evil four hundred years,"
44,7,7,"and the nation whom they shall serve I will judge, said God; and after these things they shall come forth and shall do Me service in this place."
44,7,8,"'And He gave to him a covenant of circumcision, and so he begat Isaac, and did circumcise him on the eighth day, and Isaac"
44,7,9,"and the patriarchs, having been moved with jealousy, sold Joseph to Egypt, and God was with him,"
44,7,10,"and did deliver him out of all his tribulations, and gave him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he did set him -- governor over Egypt and all his house."
44,7,11,"'And there came a dearth upon all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great tribulation, and our fathers were not finding sustenance,"
44,7,12,"and Jacob having heard that there was corn in Egypt, sent forth our fathers a first time;"
44,7,13,"and at the second time was Joseph made known to his brethren, and Joseph's kindred became manifest to Pharaoh,"
44,7,14,"and Joseph having sent, did call for his father Jacob, and all his kindred -- with seventy and five souls --"
44,7,15,"and Jacob went down to Egypt, and died, himself and our fathers,"
44,7,16,"and they were carried over into Sychem, and were laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in money from the sons of Emmor, of Sychem."
44,7,17,"'And according as the time of the promise was drawing near, which God did swear to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,"
44,7,18,"till another king rose, who had not known Joseph;"
44,7,19,"this one, having dealt subtilly with our kindred, did evil to our fathers, causing to expose their babes, that they might not live;"
44,7,20,"in which time Moses was born, and he was fair to God, and he was brought up three months in the house of his father;"
44,7,21,"and he having been exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took him up, and did rear him to herself for a son;"
44,7,22,"and Moses was taught in all wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in words and in works."
44,7,23,"'And when forty years were fulfilled to him, it came upon his heart to look after his brethren, the sons of Israel;"
44,7,24,"and having seen a certain one suffering injustice, he did defend, and did justice to the oppressed, having smitten the Egyptian;"
44,7,25,"and he was supposing his brethren to understand that God through his hand does give salvation; and they did not understand."
44,7,26,"'On the succeeding day, also, he showed himself to them as they are striving, and urged them to peace, saying, Men, brethren are you, therefore do you injustice to one another?"
44,7,27,"and he who is doing injustice to the neighbour, did thrust him away, saying, Who set you a ruler and a judge over us?"
44,7,28,"to kill me do you wish, as you did kill yesterday the Egyptian?"
44,7,29,"'And Moses fled at this word, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons,"
44,7,30,"and forty years having been fulfilled, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai a messenger of the Lord, in a flame of fire of a bush,"
44,7,31,"and Moses having seen did wonder at the sight; and he drawing near to behold, there came a voice of the Lord unto him,"
44,7,32,"I"
44,7,33,"and the Lord said to him, Loose the sandal of your feet, for the place in which you hast stood is holy ground;"
44,7,34,"seeing I have seen the affliction of My people that"
44,7,35,"'This Moses, whom they did refuse, saying, Who did set you a ruler and a judge? this one God a ruler and a redeemer did send, in the hand of a messenger who appeared to him in the bush;"
44,7,36,"this one did bring them forth, having done wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years;"
44,7,37,"this is the Moses who did say to the sons of Israel: A prophet to you shall the Lord your God raise up out of your brethren, like to me, him shall you hear."
44,7,38,"'This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the messenger who is speaking to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers who did receive the living oracles to give to us;"
44,7,39,"to whom our fathers did not wish to become obedient, but did thrust away, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,"
44,7,40,"saying to Aaron, Make to us gods who shall go on before us, for this Moses, who brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, we have not known what has happened to him."
44,7,41,"'And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands,"
44,7,42,"and God did turn, and did give them up to do service to the host of the heaven, according as it has been written in the scroll of the prophets: Slain beasts and sacrifices did you offer to Me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?"
44,7,43,"and you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan -- the figures that you made to bow before them, and I will remove your dwelling beyond Babylon."
44,7,44,"'The tabernacle of the testimony was among our fathers in the wilderness, according as He did direct, who is speaking to Moses, to make it according to the figure that he had seen;"
44,7,45,"which also our fathers having in succession received, did bring in with Joshua, into the possession of the nations whom God did drive out from the presence of our fathers, till the days of David,"
44,7,46,"who found favour before God, and requested to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob;"
44,7,47,"and Solomon built Him an house."
44,7,48,"'But the Most High in sanctuaries made with hands does not dwell, according as the prophet said:"
44,7,49,"The heaven"
44,7,50,"has not My hand made all these things?"
44,7,51,"'You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and in ears! you do always the Holy Spirit resist; as your fathers -- also you;"
44,7,52,"which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed those who declared before about the coming of the Righteous One, of whom now you betrayers and murderers have become,"
44,7,53,"who received the law by arrangement of messengers, and did not keep"
44,7,54,"And hearing these things, they were cut to the hearts, and did gnash the teeth at him;"
44,7,55,"and being full of the Holy Spirit, having looked stedfastly to the heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,"
44,7,56,"and he said, 'Lo, I see the heavens having been opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God.'"
44,7,57,"And they, having cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and did rush with one accord upon him,"
44,7,58,"and having cast him forth outside of the city, they were stoning"
44,7,59,"and they were stoning Stephen, calling and saying, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit;'"
44,7,60,"and having bowed the knees, he cried with a loud voice, 'Lord, may you not lay to them this sin;' and this having said, he fell asleep."
44,8,1,"And Saul was assenting to his death, and there came in that day a great persecution upon the assembly in Jerusalem, all also were scattered abroad in the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles;"
44,8,2,"and devout men carried away Stephen, and made great lamentation over him;"
44,8,3,"and Saul was making havoc of the assembly, into every house entering, and haling men and women, was giving them up to prison;"
44,8,4,"they then indeed, having been scattered, went abroad proclaiming good news -- the word."
44,8,5,"And Philip having gone down to a city of Samaria, was preaching to them the Christ,"
44,8,6,"the multitudes also were giving heed to the things spoken by Philip, with one accord, in their hearing and seeing the signs that he was doing,"
44,8,7,"for unclean spirits came forth from many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice, and many who have been paralytic and lame were healed,"
44,8,8,"and there was great joy in that city."
44,8,9,"And a certain man, by name Simon, was before in the city using magic, and amazing the nation of Samaria, saying himself to be a certain great one,"
44,8,10,"to whom they were all giving heed, from small unto great, saying, 'This one is the great power of God;'"
44,8,11,"and they were giving heed to him, because of his having for a long time amazed them with deeds of magic."
44,8,12,"And when they believed Philip, proclaiming good news, the things concerning the reign of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women;"
44,8,13,"and Simon also himself did believe, and, having been baptized, he was continuing with Philip, beholding also signs and mighty acts being done, he was amazed."
44,8,14,"And the apostles in Jerusalem having heard that Samaria has received the word of God, did send unto them Peter and John,"
44,8,15,"who having come down did pray concerning them, that they may receive the Holy Spirit, --"
44,8,16,"for as yet he was fallen upon none of them, and only they have been baptized -- to the name of the Lord Jesus;"
44,8,17,"then were they laying hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit."
44,8,18,"And Simon, having beheld that through the laying on of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Spirit is given, brought before them money,"
44,8,19,"saying, 'Give also to me this authority, that on whomsoever I may lay the hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.'"
44,8,20,"And Peter said unto him, 'Your silver with you -- may it be to destruction! because the gift of God you did think to possess through money;"
44,8,21,"you hast neither part nor lot in this thing, for your heart is not right before God;"
44,8,22,"reform, therefore, from this your wickedness, and beseech God, if then the purpose of your heart may be forgiven you,"
44,8,23,"for in the gall of bitterness, and bond of unrighteousness, I perceive you being.'"
44,8,24,"And Simon answering, said, 'Beseech you for me unto the Lord, that nothing may come upon me of the things you have spoken.'"
44,8,25,"They indeed, therefore, having testified fully, and spoken the word of the Lord, did turn back to Jerusalem; in many villages also of the Samaritans they did proclaim good news."
44,8,26,"And a messenger of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, 'Arise, and go on toward the south, on the way that is going down from Jerusalem to Gaza,' -- this is desert."
44,8,27,"And having arisen, he went on, and lo, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch, a man of rank, of Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to worship to Jerusalem;"
44,8,28,"he was also returning, and is sitting on his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah."
44,8,29,"And the Spirit said to Philip, 'Go near, and be joined to this chariot;'"
44,8,30,"and Philip having run near, heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, 'Do you then know what you do read?'"
44,8,31,"and he said, 'Why, how am I able, if some one may not guide me?' he called Philip also, having come up, to sit with him."
44,8,32,"And the contents of the Writing that he was reading was this: 'As a sheep unto slaughter he was led, and as a lamb before his shearer dumb, so he does not open his mouth;"
44,8,33,"in his humiliation his judgment was taken away, and his generation -- who shall declare? because taken from the earth is his life.'"
44,8,34,"And the eunuch answering Philip said, 'I pray you, about whom does the prophet say this? about himself, or about some other one?'"
44,8,35,"and Philip having opened his mouth, and having begun from this Writing, proclaimed good news to him -- Jesus."
44,8,36,"And as they were going on the way, they came upon a certain water, and the eunuch said, 'Lo, water; what does hinder me to be baptized?'"
44,8,37,""
44,8,38,"and he commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down to the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him;"
44,8,39,"and when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more, for he was going on his way rejoicing;"
44,8,40,"and Philip was found at Azotus, and passing through, he was proclaiming good news to all the cities, till his coming to Caesarea."
44,9,1,"And Saul, yet breathing of threatening and slaughter to the disciples of the Lord, having gone to the chief priest,"
44,9,2,"did ask from him letters to Damascus, unto the synagogues, that if he may find any being of the way, both men and women, he may bring them bound to Jerusalem."
44,9,3,"And in the going, he came near to Damascus, and suddenly there shone round about him a light from the heaven,"
44,9,4,"and having fallen upon the earth, he heard a voice saying to him,"
44,9,5,"And he said, 'Who are you, Lord?' and the Lord said,"
44,9,6,"trembling also, and astonished, he said, 'Lord, what do you wish me to do?' and the Lord"
44,9,7,"And the men who are journeying with him stood speechless, hearing indeed the voice but seeing no one,"
44,9,8,"and Saul arose from the earth, and his eyes having been opened, he beheld no one, and leading him by the hand they brought him to Damascus,"
44,9,9,"and he was three days without seeing, and he did neither eat nor drink."
44,9,10,"And there was a certain disciple in Damascus, by name Ananias, and the Lord said unto him in a vision,"
44,9,11,"and the Lord"
44,9,12,""
44,9,13,"And Ananias answered, 'Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how many evils he did to Your saints in Jerusalem,"
44,9,14,"and here he has authority from the chief priests, to bind all those calling on Your name.'"
44,9,15,"And the Lord said unto him,"
44,9,16,""
44,9,17,"And Ananias went away, and did enter into the house, and having put upon him"
44,9,18,"And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales, he saw again also presently, and having risen, was baptized,"
44,9,19,"and having received nourishment, was strengthened, and Saul was with the disciples in Damascus certain days,"
44,9,20,"and immediately in the synagogues he was preaching the Christ, that he is the Son of God."
44,9,21,"And all those hearing were amazed, and said, 'Is not this he who laid waist in Jerusalem those calling on this name, and hither to this intent had come, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?'"
44,9,22,"And Saul was still more strengthened, and he was confounding the Jews dwelling in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ."
44,9,23,"And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him,"
44,9,24,"and their counsel against"
44,9,25,"and the disciples having taken him, by night did let him down by the wall, letting down in a basket."
44,9,26,"And Saul, having come to Jerusalem, did try to join himself to the disciples, and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he is a disciple,"
44,9,27,"and Barnabas having taken him, brought"
44,9,28,"And he was with them, coming in and going out in Jerusalem,"
44,9,29,"and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, he was both speaking and disputing with the Hellenists, and they were taking in hand to kill him,"
44,9,30,"and the brethren having known, brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus."
44,9,31,"Then, indeed, the assemblies throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, had peace, being built up, and, going on in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied."
44,9,32,"And it came to pass that Peter passing throughout all"
44,9,33,"and he found there a certain man, Aeneas by name -- for eight years laid upon a couch -- who was paralytic,"
44,9,34,"and Peter said to him, 'Aeneas, heal you does Jesus the Christ; arise and spread for yourself;' and immediately he rose,"
44,9,35,"and all those dwelling at Lydda, and Saron saw him, and did turn to the Lord."
44,9,36,"And in Joppa there was a certain female disciple, by name Tabitha, (which interpreted, is called Dorcas,) this woman was full of good works and kind acts that she was doing;"
44,9,37,"and it came to pass in those days she, having ailed, died, and having bathed her, they laid her in an upper chamber,"
44,9,38,"and Lydda being near to Joppa, the disciples having heard that Peter is in that"
44,9,39,"And Peter having risen, went with them, whom having come, they brought into the upper chamber, and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing coats and garments, as many as Dorcas was making while she was with them."
44,9,40,"And Peter having put them all forth without, having bowed the knees, did pray, and having turned unto the body said, 'Tabitha, arise;' and she opened her eyes, and having seen Peter, she sat up,"
44,9,41,"and having given her"
44,9,42,"and it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord;"
44,9,43,"and it came to pass, that he remained many days in Joppa, with a certain one, Simon a tanner."
44,10,1,"And there was a certain man in Caesarea, by name Cornelius, a centurion from a band called Italian,"
44,10,2,"pious, and fearing God with all his house, doing also many kind acts to the people, and beseeching God always,"
44,10,3,"he saw in a vision manifestly, as it were the ninth hour of the day, a messenger of God coming in unto him, and saying to him, 'Cornelius;'"
44,10,4,"and he having looked earnestly on him, and becoming afraid, said, 'What is it, Lord?' And he said to him, 'Your prayers and your kind acts came up for a memorial before God,"
44,10,5,"and now send men to Joppa, and send for a certain one Simon, who is surnamed Peter,"
44,10,6,"this one does lodge with a certain Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea; this one shall speak to you what it behooves you to do.'"
44,10,7,"And when the messenger who is speaking to Cornelius went away, having called two of his domestics, and a pious soldier of those waiting on him continually,"
44,10,8,"and having declared to them all things, he sent them to Joppa."
44,10,9,"And on the morrow, as these are proceeding on the way, and are drawing near to the city, Peter went up upon the house-top to pray, about the sixth hour,"
44,10,10,"and he became very hungry, and wished to eat; and they making ready, there fell upon him a trance,"
44,10,11,"and he does behold the heaven opened, and descending unto him a certain vessel, as a great sheet, bound at the four corners, and let down upon the earth,"
44,10,12,"in which were all the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of the heaven,"
44,10,13,"and there came a voice unto him:"
44,10,14,"And Peter said, 'Not so, Lord; because at no time did I eat anything common or unclean;'"
44,10,15,"and"
44,10,16,"and this was done thrice, and again was the vessel received up to the heaven."
44,10,17,"And as Peter was perplexed in himself what the vision that he saw might be, then, lo, the men who have been sent from Cornelius, having made inquiry for the house of Simon, stood at the gate,"
44,10,18,"and having called, they were asking if Simon, who is surnamed Peter, does lodge here?"
44,10,19,"And Peter thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, 'Lo, three men do seek you;"
44,10,20,"but having risen, go down and go on with them, nothing doubting, because I have sent them;'"
44,10,21,"and Peter having come down unto the men who have been sent from Cornelius unto him, said, 'Lo, I am he whom you seek, what"
44,10,22,"And they said, 'Cornelius, a centurion, a man righteous and fearing God, well testified to, also, by all the nation of the Jews, was divinely warned by a holy messenger to send for you, to his house, and to hear sayings from you.'"
44,10,23,"Having called them in, therefore, he lodged them, and on the morrow Peter went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa went with him,"
44,10,24,"and on the morrow they did enter into Caesarea; and Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kindred and near friends,"
44,10,25,"and as it came that Peter entered in, Cornelius having met him, having fallen at"
44,10,26,"and Peter raised him, saying, 'Stand up; I also myself am a man;'"
44,10,27,"and talking with him he went in, and does find many having come together."
44,10,28,"And he said unto them, 'You know how it is unlawful for a man, a Jew, to keep company with, or to come unto, one of another race, but to me God did show to call no man common or unclean;"
44,10,29,"therefore also without gainsaying I came, having been sent for; I ask, therefore, for what matter you did send for me?'"
44,10,30,"And Cornelius said, 'Four days ago till this hour, I was fasting, and"
44,10,31,"and he said, Cornelius, your prayer was heard, and your kind acts were remembered before God;"
44,10,32,"send, therefore, to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; this one does lodge in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea, who having come, shall speak to you;"
44,10,33,"at once, therefore, I sent to you; you also did do well, having come; now, therefore, are we all before God present to hear all things that have been commanded you by God.'"
44,10,34,"And Peter having opened his mouth, said, 'Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons,"
44,10,35,"but in every nation he who is fearing Him, and is working righteousness, is acceptable to Him;"
44,10,36,"the word that he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming good news -- peace through Jesus Christ (this one is Lord of all,)"
44,10,37,"you -- you have known; -- the word that came throughout all Judea, having begun from Galilee, after the baptism that John preached;"
44,10,38,"Jesus who"
44,10,39,"and we -- we are witnesses of all things that he did, both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem, -- whom they did slay, having hanged upon a tree."
44,10,40,"'This one God did raise up the third day, and gave him to become manifest,"
44,10,41,"not to all the people, but to witnesses, to those having been chosen before by God -- to us who did eat with"
44,10,42,"and he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify fully that it is he who has been ordained by God judge of living and dead --"
44,10,43,"to this one do all the prophets testify, that through his name every one that is believing in him does receive remission of sins.'"
44,10,44,"While Peter is yet speaking these sayings, the Holy spirit fell upon all those hearing the word,"
44,10,45,"and those of the circumcision believing were astonished -- as many as came with Peter -- because also upon the nations the gift of the Holy Spirit has been poured out,"
44,10,46,"for they were hearing them speaking with tongues and magnifying God."
44,10,47,"Then answered Peter, 'The water is any one able to forbid, that these may not be baptized, who the Holy Spirit did receive -- even as also we?'"
44,10,48,"he commanded them also to be baptized in the name of the Lord; then they besought him to remain certain days."
44,11,1,"And the apostles and the brethren who are in Judea heard that also the nations did receive the word of God,"
44,11,2,"and when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision were contending with him,"
44,11,3,"saying -- 'Unto men uncircumcised you did go in, and did eat with them!'"
44,11,4,"And Peter having begun, did expound to them in order saying,"
44,11,5,"'I was in the city of Joppa praying, and I saw in a trance a vision, a certain vessel coming down, as a great sheet by four corners being let down out of the heaven, and it came unto me;"
44,11,6,"at which having looked stedfastly, I was considering, and I saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of heaven;"
44,11,7,"and I heard a voice saying to me,"
44,11,8,"and I said, Not so, Lord; because anything common or unclean has at no time entered into my mouth;"
44,11,9,"and a voice did answer me a second time out of the heaven,"
44,11,10,"'And this happened thrice, and again was all drawn up to the heaven,"
44,11,11,"and, lo, immediately, three men stood at the house in which I was, having been sent from Caesarea unto me,"
44,11,12,"and the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing doubting, and these six brethren also went with me, and we did enter into the house of the man,"
44,11,13,"he declared also to us how he saw the messenger in his house standing, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter,"
44,11,14,"who shall speak sayings by which you shall be saved, you and all your house."
44,11,15,"'And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit did fall upon them, even as also upon us in the beginning,"
44,11,16,"and I remembered the saying of the Lord, how he said,"
44,11,17,"if then the equal gift God did give to them as also to us, having believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, I -- how was I able to withstand God?'"
44,11,18,"And they, having heard these things, were silent, and were glorifying God, saying, 'Then, indeed, also to the nations did God give the reformation to life.'"
44,11,19,"Those, indeed, therefore, having been scattered abroad, from the tribulation that came after Stephen, went through unto Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none except to Jews only;"
44,11,20,"and there were certain of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who having entered into Antioch, were speaking unto the Hellenists, proclaiming good news -- the Lord Jesus,"
44,11,21,"and the hand of the Lord was with them, a great number also, having believed, did turn unto the Lord."
44,11,22,"And the account was heard in the ears of the assembly that"
44,11,23,"who, having come, and having seen the grace of God, was glad, and was exhorting all with purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord,"
44,11,24,"because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit, and of faith, and a great multitude was added to the Lord."
44,11,25,"And Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, to seek for Saul,"
44,11,26,"and having found him, he brought him to Antioch, and it came to pass that they a whole year did assemble together in the assembly, and taught a great multitude, the disciples also were divinely called first in Antioch Christians."
44,11,27,"And in those days there came from Jerusalem prophets to Antioch,"
44,11,28,"and one of them, by name Agabus, having stood up, did signify through the Spirit a great dearth is about to be throughout all the world -- which also came to pass in the time of Claudius Caesar --"
44,11,29,"and the disciples, according as any one was prospering, determined each of them to send for ministration to the brethren dwelling in Judea,"
44,11,30,"which also they did, having sent unto the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul."
44,12,1,"And about that time, Herod the king put forth his hands, to do evil to certain of those of the assembly,"
44,12,2,"and he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword,"
44,12,3,"and having seen that it is pleasing to the Jews, he added to lay hold of Peter also -- and they were the days of the unleavened food --"
44,12,4,"whom also having seized, he did put in prison, having delivered"
44,12,5,"Peter, therefore, indeed, was kept in the prison, and fervent prayer was being made by the assembly unto God for him,"
44,12,6,"and when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night was Peter sleeping between two soldiers, having been bound with two chains, guards also before the door were keeping the prison,"
44,12,7,"and lo, a messenger of the Lord stood by, and a light shone in the buildings, and having smitten Peter on the side, he raised him up, saying, 'Rise in haste,' and his chains fell from off"
44,12,8,"The messenger also said to him, 'Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals;' and he did so; and he said to him, 'Put your garment round and be following me;'"
44,12,9,"and having gone forth, he was following him, and he knew not that it is true that which is done through the messenger, and was thinking he saw a vision,"
44,12,10,"and having passed through a first ward, and a second, they came unto the iron gate that is leading to the city, which of its own accord did open to them, and having gone forth, they went on through one street, and immediately the messenger departed from him."
44,12,11,"And Peter having come to himself, said, 'Now I have known of a truth that the Lord did sent forth His messenger, and did deliver me out of the hand of Herod, and all the expectation of the people of the Jews;'"
44,12,12,"also, having considered, he came unto the house of Mary, the mother of John, who is surnamed Mark, where there were many thronged together and praying."
44,12,13,"And Peter having knocked at the door of the porch, there came a damsel to hearken, by name Rhoda,"
44,12,14,"and having known the voice of Peter, from the joy she did not open the porch, but having run in, told of the standing of Peter before the porch,"
44,12,15,"and they said unto her, 'You are mad;' and she was confidently affirming"
44,12,16,"and Peter was continuing knocking, and having opened, they saw him, and were astonished,"
44,12,17,"and having beckoned to them with the hand to be silent, he declared to them how the Lord brought him out of the prison, and he said, 'Declare to James and to the brethren these things;' and having gone forth, he went on to another place."
44,12,18,"And day having come, there was not a little stir among the soldiers what then was become of Peter,"
44,12,19,"and Herod having sought for him, and not having found, having examined the guards, did command"
44,12,20,"And Herod was highly displeased with the Tyrians and Sidonians, and with one accord they came unto him, and having made a friend of Blastus, who"
44,12,21,"and on a set day, Herod having arrayed himself in kingly apparel, and having sat down upon the tribunal, was making an oration unto them,"
44,12,22,"and the populace were shouting, 'The voice of a god, and not of a man;'"
44,12,23,"and presently there smote him a messenger of the Lord, because he did not give the glory to God, and having been eaten of worms, he expired."
44,12,24,"And the word of God did grow and did multiply,"
44,12,25,"and Barnabas and Saul did turn back out of Jerusalem, having fulfilled the ministration, having taken also with"
44,13,1,"And there were certain in Antioch, in the assembly there, prophets and teachers; both Barnabas, and Simeon who is called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen also -- Herod the tetrarch's foster-brother -- and Saul;"
44,13,2,"and in their ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Separate you to me both Barnabas and Saul to the work to which I have called them,'"
44,13,3,"then having fasted, and having prayed, and having laid the hands on them, they sent"
44,13,4,"These, indeed, then, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, thence also they sailed to Cyprus,"
44,13,5,"and having come unto Salamis, they declared the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they had also John"
44,13,6,"and having gone through the island unto Paphos, they found a certain magian, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name"
44,13,7,"who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man; this one having called for Barnabas and Saul, did desire to hear the word of God,"
44,13,8,"and there withstood them Elymas the magian -- for so is his name interpreted -- seeking to pervert the proconsul from the faith."
44,13,9,"And Saul -- who also"
44,13,10,"said, 'O full of all guile, and all profligacy, son of a devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the right ways of the Lord?"
44,13,11,"and now, lo, a hand of the Lord"
44,13,12,"then the proconsul having seen what has come to pass, did believe, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord."
44,13,13,"And those about Paul having set sail from Paphos, came to Perga of Pamphylia, and John having departed from them, did turn back to Jerusalem,"
44,13,14,"and they having gone through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia, and having gone into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, they sat down,"
44,13,15,"and after the reading of the law and of the prophets, the chief men of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, 'Men, brethren, if there be a word in you of exhortation unto the people -- say on.'"
44,13,16,"And Paul having risen, and having beckoned with the hand, said, 'Men, Israelites, and those fearing God, hearken:"
44,13,17,"the God of this people Israel did choose our fathers, and the people He did exalt in their sojourning in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm did He bring them out of it;"
44,13,18,"and about a period of forty years He did suffer their manners in the wilderness,"
44,13,19,"and having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He did divide by lot to them their land."
44,13,20,"'And after these things, about four hundred and fifty years, He gave judges -- till Samuel the prophet;"
44,13,21,"and thereafter they asked for a king, and God did give to them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years;"
44,13,22,"and having removed him, He did raise up to them David for king, to whom also having testified, he said, I found David, the"
44,13,23,"'Of this one's seed God, according to promise, did raise to Israel a Saviour -- Jesus,"
44,13,24,"John having first preached, before his coming, a baptism of reformation to all the people of Israel;"
44,13,25,"and as John was fulfilling the course, he said, Whom me do you suppose to be? I am not"
44,13,26,"'Men, brethren, sons of the race of Abraham, and those among you fearing God, to you was the word of this salvation sent,"
44,13,27,"for those dwelling in Jerusalem, and their chiefs, this one not having known, also the voices of the prophets, which every sabbath are being read -- having judged"
44,13,28,"and no cause of death having found, they did ask of Pilate that he should be slain,"
44,13,29,"and when they did complete all the things written about him, having taken"
44,13,30,"and God did raise him out of the dead,"
44,13,31,"and he was seen for many days of those who did come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people."
44,13,32,"'And we to you do proclaim good news -- that the promise made unto the fathers,"
44,13,33,"God has in full completed this to us their children, having raised up Jesus, as also in the second Psalm it has been written, My Son you are -- I to-day have begotten you."
44,13,34,"'And that He did raise him up out of the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has said thus -- I will give to you the faithful kindnesses of David;"
44,13,35,"therefore also in another"
44,13,36,"for David, indeed, his own generation having served by the will of God, did fall asleep, and was added unto his fathers, and saw corruption,"
44,13,37,"but he whom God did raise up, did not see corruption."
44,13,38,"'Let it therefore be known to you, men, brethren, that through this one to you is the forgiveness of sins declared,"
44,13,39,"and from all things from which you were not able in the law of Moses to be declared righteous, in this one every one who is believing is declared righteous;"
44,13,40,"see, therefore, it may not come upon you that has been spoken in the prophets:"
44,13,41,"See, you despisers, and wonder, and perish, because a work I -- I do work in your days, a work in which you may not believe, though any one may declare"
44,13,42,"And having gone forth out of the synagogue of the Jews, the nations were calling upon"
44,13,43,"and the synagogue having been dismissed, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes did follow Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, were persuading them to remain in the grace of God."
44,13,44,"And on the coming sabbath, almost all the city was gathered together to hear the word of God,"
44,13,45,"and the Jews having seen the multitudes, were filled with zeal, and did contradict the things spoken by Paul -- contradicting and speaking evil."
44,13,46,"And speaking boldly, Paul and Barnabas said, 'To you it was necessary that first the word of God be spoken, and seeing you do thrust it away, and do not judge yourselves worthy of the life age-during, lo, we do turn to the nations;"
44,13,47,"for so has the Lord commanded us: I have set you for a light of nations -- for your being for salvation unto the end of the earth.'"
44,13,48,"And the nations hearing were glad, and were glorifying the word of the Lord, and did believe -- as many as were appointed to life age-during;"
44,13,49,"and the word of the Lord was spread abroad through all the region."
44,13,50,"And the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the first men of the city, and did raise persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and did put them out from their borders;"
44,13,51,"and they having shaken off the dust of their feet against them, came to Iconium,"
44,13,52,"and the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit."
44,14,1,"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they did enter together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spake, so that there believed both of Jews and Greeks a great multitude;"
44,14,2,"and the unbelieving Jews did stir up and made evil the souls of the nations against the brethren;"
44,14,3,"long time, indeed, therefore, did they abide speaking boldly in the Lord, who is testifying to the word of His grace, and granting signs and wonders to come to pass through their hands."
44,14,4,"And the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews, and some with the apostles,"
44,14,5,"and when there was a purpose both of the nations and of the Jews with their rulers to use"
44,14,6,"they having become aware, did flee to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and to the region round about,"
44,14,7,"and there they were proclaiming good news."
44,14,8,"And a certain man in Lystra, impotent in the feet, was sitting, being lame from the womb of his mother -- who never had walked,"
44,14,9,"this one was hearing Paul speaking, who, having stedfastly beheld him, and having seen that he has faith to be saved,"
44,14,10,"said with a loud voice, 'Stand up on your feet upright;' and he was springing and walking,"
44,14,11,"and the multitudes having seen what Paul did, did lift up their voice, in the speech of Lycaonia, saying, 'The gods, having become like men, did come down unto us;'"
44,14,12,"they were calling also Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes, since he was the leader in speaking."
44,14,13,"And the priest of the Zeus that is before their city, oxen and garlands unto the porches having brought, with the multitudes did wish to sacrifice,"
44,14,14,"and having heard, the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having rent their garments, did spring into the multitude, crying"
44,14,15,"and saying, 'Men, why these things do you? and we are men like-affected with you, proclaiming good news to you, from these vanities to turn unto the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the things in them;"
44,14,16,"who in the past generations did suffer all the nations to go on in their ways,"
44,14,17,"though, indeed, without witness He did not leave himself, doing good -- from heaven giving rains to us, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness;'"
44,14,18,"and these things saying, scarcely did they restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them."
44,14,19,"And there came thither, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews, and they having persuaded the multitudes, and having stoned Paul, drew him outside of the city, having supposed him to be dead;"
44,14,20,"and the disciples having surrounded him, having risen he entered into the city, and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe."
44,14,21,"Having proclaimed good news also to that city, and having discipled many, they turned back to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch,"
44,14,22,"confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting to remain in the faith, and that through many tribulations it behooves us to enter into the reign of God,"
44,14,23,"and having appointed to them by vote elders in every assembly, having prayed with fastings, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed."
44,14,24,"And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia,"
44,14,25,"and having spoken in Perga the word, they went down to Attalia,"
44,14,26,"and thence did sail to Antioch, whence they had been given by the grace of God for the work that they fulfilled;"
44,14,27,"and having come and gathered together the assembly, they declared as many things as God did with them, and that He did open to the nations a door of faith;"
44,14,28,"and they abode there not a little time with the disciples."
44,15,1,"And certain having come down from Judea, were teaching the brethren -- 'If you be not circumcised after the custom of Moses, you are not able to be saved;'"
44,15,2,"there having been, therefore, not a little dissension and disputation to Paul and Barnabas with them, they arranged for Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, to go up unto the apostles and elders to Jerusalem about this question,"
44,15,3,"they indeed, then, having been sent forward by the assembly, were passing through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the nations, and they were causing great joy to all the brethren."
44,15,4,"And having come to Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly, and the apostles, and the elders, they declared also as many things as God did with them;"
44,15,5,"and there rose up certain of those of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying -- 'It behooves to circumcise them, to command them also to keep the law of Moses.'"
44,15,6,"And there were gathered together the apostles and the elders, to see about this matter,"
44,15,7,"and there having been much disputing, Peter having risen up said unto them, 'Men, brethren, you know that from former days, God among us did make choice, through my mouth, for the nations to hear the word of the good news, and to believe;"
44,15,8,"and the heart-knowing God did bare them testimony, having given to them the Holy Spirit, even as also to us,"
44,15,9,"and did put no difference also between us and them, by the faith having purified their hearts;"
44,15,10,"now, therefore, why do you tempt God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
44,15,11,"but, through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe to be saved, even as also they.'"
44,15,12,"And all the multitude did keep silence, and were hearkening to Barnabas and Paul, declaring as many signs and wonders as God did among the nations through them;"
44,15,13,"and after they are silent, James answered, saying, 'Men, brethren, hearken to me;"
44,15,14,"Simeon did declare how at first God did look after to take out of the nations a people for His name,"
44,15,15,"and to this agree the words of the prophets, as it has been written:"
44,15,16,"After these things I will turn back, and I will build again the tabernacle of David, that is fallen down, and its ruins I will build again, and will set it upright --"
44,15,17,"that the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the nations, upon whom My name has been called, said the Lord, who is doing all these things."
44,15,18,"'Known from the ages to God are all His works;"
44,15,19,"therefore I judge: not to trouble those who from the nations do turn back to God,"
44,15,20,"but to write to them to abstain from the pollutions of the idols, and the whoredom, and the strangled thing; and the blood;"
44,15,21,"for Moses from former generations in every city has those preaching him -- in the synagogues every sabbath being read.'"
44,15,22,"Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, chosen men out of themselves to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas -- Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren --"
44,15,23,"having written through their hand thus: 'The apostles, and the elders, and the brethren, to those in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, brethren, who"
44,15,24,"seeing we have heard that certain having gone forth from us did trouble you with words, subverting your souls, saying to be circumcised and to keep the law, to whom we did give no charge,"
44,15,25,"it seemed good to us, having come together with one accord, chosen men to send unto you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul --"
44,15,26,"men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ --"
44,15,27,"we have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, and they by word are telling the same things."
44,15,28,"'For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, no more burden to lay upon you, except these necessary things:"
44,15,29,"to abstain from things offered to idols, and blood, and a strangled thing, and whoredom; from which keeping yourselves, you shall do well; be strong!'"
44,15,30,"They then, indeed, having been let go, went to Antioch, and having brought the multitude together, did deliver the epistle,"
44,15,31,"and they having read, did rejoice for the consolation;"
44,15,32,"Judas also and Silas, being themselves also prophets, through much discourse did exhort the brethren, and confirm,"
44,15,33,"and having passed some time, they were let go with peace from the brethren unto the apostles;"
44,15,34,"and it seemed good to Silas to remain there still."
44,15,35,"And Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming good news -- with many others also -- the word of the Lord;"
44,15,36,"and after certain days, Paul said unto Barnabas, 'Having turned back again, we may look after our brethren, in every city in which we have preached the word of the Lord -- how they are.'"
44,15,37,"And Barnabas counseled to take with"
44,15,38,"and Paul was not thinking it good to take him with them who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work;"
44,15,39,"there came, therefore, a sharp contention, so that they were parted from one another, and Barnabas having taken Mark, did sail to Cyprus,"
44,15,40,"and Paul having chosen Silas, went forth, having been given up to the grace of God by the brethren;"
44,15,41,"and he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the assemblies."
44,16,1,"And he came to Derbe and Lystra, and lo, a certain disciple was there, by name Timotheus son of a certain woman, a believing Jewess, but of a father, a Greek,"
44,16,2,"who was well testified to by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium;"
44,16,3,"this one did Paul wish to go forth with him, and having taken"
44,16,4,"And as they were going on through the cities, they were delivering to them the decrees to keep, that have been judged by the apostles and the elders who"
44,16,5,"then, indeed, were the assemblies established in the faith, and were abounding in number every day;"
44,16,6,"and having gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia,"
44,16,7,"having gone toward Mysia, they were trying to go on toward Bithynia, and the Spirit did not suffer them,"
44,16,8,"and having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas."
44,16,9,"And a vision through the night appeared to Paul -- a certain man of Macedonia was standing, calling upon him, and saying, 'Having passed through to Macedonia, help us;' --"
44,16,10,"and when he saw the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go forth to Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord has called us to preach good news to them,"
44,16,11,"having set sail, therefore, from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, on the morrow also to Neapolis,"
44,16,12,"thence also to Philippi, which is a principal city of the part of Macedonia -- a colony. And we were in this city abiding certain days,"
44,16,13,"on the sabbath-day also we went forth outside of the city, by a river, where there used to be prayer, and having sat down, we were speaking to the women who came together,"
44,16,14,"and a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, was hearing, whose heart the Lord did open to attend to the things spoken by Paul;"
44,16,15,"and when she was baptized, and her household, she did call upon us, saying, 'If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, having entered into my house, remain;' and she constrained us."
44,16,16,"And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain maid, having a spirit of Python, did meet us, who brought much employment to her masters by soothsaying,"
44,16,17,"she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying, 'These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us a way of salvation;'"
44,16,18,"and this she was doing for many days, but Paul having been grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, 'I command you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come forth from her;' and it came forth the same hour."
44,16,19,"And her masters having seen that the hope of their employment was gone, having caught Paul and Silas, drew"
44,16,20,"and having brought them to the magistrates, they said, 'These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews;"
44,16,21,"and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.'"
44,16,22,"And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates having torn their garments from them, were commanding to beat"
44,16,23,"many blows also having laid upon them, they cast them to prison, having given charge to the jailor to keep them safely,"
44,16,24,"who such a charge having received, did put them to the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks."
44,16,25,"And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were hearing them,"
44,16,26,"and suddenly a great earthquake came, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, opened also presently were all the doors, and of all -- the bands were loosed;"
44,16,27,"and the jailor having come out of sleep, and having seen the doors of the prison open, having drawn a sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to be fled,"
44,16,28,"and Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'You may not do yourself any harm, for we are all here.'"
44,16,29,"And, having asked for a light, he sprang in, and trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas,"
44,16,30,"and having brought them forth, said, 'Sirs, what must I do -- that I may be saved?'"
44,16,31,"and they said, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved -- you and your house;'"
44,16,32,"and they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all those in his household;"
44,16,33,"and having taken them, in that hour of the night, he did bathe"
44,16,34,"having brought them also into his house, he set food before"
44,16,35,"And day having come, the magistrates sent the rod-bearers, saying, 'Let those men go;'"
44,16,36,"and the jailor told these words unto Paul -- 'The magistrates have sent, that you may be let go; now, therefore, having gone forth go on in peace;'"
44,16,37,"and Paul said to them, 'Having beaten us publicly uncondemned -- men, Romans being -- they did cast"
44,16,38,"And the rod-bearers told to the magistrates these sayings, and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans,"
44,16,39,"and having come, they besought them, and having brought"
44,16,40,"and they, having gone forth out of the prison, entered into"
44,17,1,"And having passed through Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews,"
44,17,2,"and according to the custom of Paul, he went in unto them, and for three sabbaths he was reasoning with them from the Writings,"
44,17,3,"opening and alleging, 'That the Christ it behoved to suffer, and to rise again out of the dead, and that this is the Christ -- Jesus whom I proclaim to you.'"
44,17,4,"And certain of them did believe, and attached themselves to Paul and to Silas, also of the worshipping Greeks a great multitude, of the principal women also not a few."
44,17,5,"And the unbelieving Jews, having been moved with envy, and having taken to them of the loungers certain evil men, and having made a crowd, were setting the city in an uproar; having assailed also the house of Jason, they were seeking them to bring"
44,17,6,"and not having found them, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the city rulers, calling aloud -- 'These, having put the world in commotion, are also here present,"
44,17,7,"whom Jason has received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying another to be king -- Jesus.'"
44,17,8,"And they troubled the multitude and the city rulers, hearing these things,"
44,17,9,"and having taking security from Jason and the rest, they let them go."
44,17,10,"And the brethren immediately, through the night, sent forth both Paul and Silas to Berea, who having come, went to the synagogue of the Jews;"
44,17,11,"and these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, they received the word with all readiness of mind, every day examining the Writings whether those things were so;"
44,17,12,"many, indeed, therefore, of them did believe, and of the honourable Greek women and men not a few."
44,17,13,"And when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that also in Berea was the word of God declared by Paul, they came thither also, agitating the multitudes;"
44,17,14,"and then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul, to go on as it were to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy were remaining there."
44,17,15,"And those conducting Paul, brought him unto Athens, and having received a command unto Silas and Timotheus that with all speed they may come unto him, they departed;"
44,17,16,"and Paul waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, beholding the city wholly given to idolatry,"
44,17,17,"therefore, indeed, he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the worshipping persons, and in the market-place every day with those who met with him."
44,17,18,"And certain of the Epicurean and of the Stoic philosophers, were meeting together to see him, and some were saying, 'What would this seed picker wish to say?' and others, 'Of strange demons he does seem to be an announcer;' because Jesus and the rising again he did proclaim to them as good news,"
44,17,19,"having also taken him, unto the Areopagus they brought"
44,17,20,"for certain strange things you do bring to our ears? we wish, then, to know what these things would wish to be;'"
44,17,21,"and all Athenians, and the strangers sojourning, for nothing else were at leisure but to say something, and to hear some newer thing."
44,17,22,"And Paul, having stood in the midst of the Areopagus, said, 'Men, Athenians, in all things I perceive you as over-religious;"
44,17,23,"for passing through and contemplating your objects of worship, I found also an erection on which had been inscribed: To God -- unknown; whom, therefore -- not knowing -- you do worship, this One I announce to you."
44,17,24,"'God, who did make the world, and all things in it, this One, of heaven and of earth being Lord, in temples made with hands does not dwell,"
44,17,25,"neither by the hands of men is He served -- needing anything, He giving to all life, and breath, and all things;"
44,17,26,"He made also of one blood every nation of men, to dwell upon all the face of the earth -- having ordained times before appointed, and the bounds of their dwellings --"
44,17,27,"to seek the Lord, if perhaps they did feel after Him and find, -- though, indeed, He is not far from each one of us,"
44,17,28,"for in Him we live, and move, and are; as also certain of your poets have said: For of Him also we are offspring."
44,17,29,"'Being, therefore, offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead to be like to gold, or silver, or stone, graving of art and device of man;"
44,17,30,"the times, indeed, therefore, of the ignorance God having overlooked, does now command all men everywhere to reform,"
44,17,31,"because He did set a day in which He is about to judge the world in righteousness, by a man whom He did ordain, having given assurance to all, having raised him out of the dead.'"
44,17,32,"And having heard of a rising again of the dead, some, indeed, were mocking, but others said, 'We will hear you again concerning this;'"
44,17,33,"and so Paul went forth from the midst of them,"
44,17,34,"and certain men having cleaved to him, did believe, among whom"
44,18,1,"And after these things, Paul having departed out of Athens, came to Corinth,"
44,18,2,"and having found a certain Jew, by name Aquilas, of Pontus by birth, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife -- because of Claudius having directed all the Jews to depart out of Rome -- he came to them,"
44,18,3,"and because of being of the same craft, he did remain with them, and was working, for they were tent-makers as to craft;"
44,18,4,"and he was reasoning in the synagogue every sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks."
44,18,5,"And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the Spirit, testifying fully to the Jews Jesus the Christ;"
44,18,6,"and on their resisting and speaking evil, having shaken"
44,18,7,"And having departed thence, he went to the house of a certain one, by name Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue,"
44,18,8,"and Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue did believe in the Lord with all his house, and many of the Corinthians hearing were believing, and they were being baptized."
44,18,9,"And the Lord said through a vision in the night to Paul,"
44,18,10,""
44,18,11,"and he continued a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God."
44,18,12,"And Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a rush with one accord upon Paul, and brought him unto the tribunal,"
44,18,13,"saying -- 'Against the law this one does persuade men to worship God;'"
44,18,14,"and Paul being about to open"
44,18,15,"but if it is a question concerning words and names, and of your law, look you yourselves"
44,18,16,"and he drave them from the tribunal;"
44,18,17,"and all the Greeks having taken Sosthenes, the chief man of the synagogue, were beating"
44,18,18,"And Paul having remained yet a good many days, having taken leave of the brethren, was sailing to Syria -- and with him"
44,18,19,"and he came down to Ephesus, and did leave them there, and he himself having entered into the synagogue did reason with the Jews:"
44,18,20,"and they having requested"
44,18,21,"but took leave of them, saying, 'It behooves me by all means the coming feast to keep at Jerusalem, and again I will return unto you -- God willing.' And he sailed from Ephesus,"
44,18,22,"and having come down to Caesarea, having gone up, and having saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch."
44,18,23,"And having made some stay he went forth, going through in order the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples."
44,18,24,"And a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, a man of eloquence, being mighty in the Writings, came to Ephesus,"
44,18,25,"this one was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in the Spirit, was speaking and teaching exactly the things about the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John;"
44,18,26,"this one also began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and Aquilas and Priscilla having heard of him, took him to"
44,18,27,"and he being minded to go through into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples, having exhorted them to receive him, who having come, did help them much who have believed through the grace,"
44,18,28,"for powerfully the Jews he was refuting publicly, showing through the Writings Jesus to be the Christ."
44,19,1,"And it came to pass, in Apollos' being in Corinth, Paul having gone through the upper parts, came to Ephesus, and having found certain disciples,"
44,19,2,"he said unto them, 'The Holy Spirit did you receive -- having believed?' and they said unto him, 'But we did not even hear whether there is any Holy Spirit;'"
44,19,3,"and he said unto them, 'To what, then, were you baptized?' and they said, 'To John's baptism.'"
44,19,4,"And Paul said, 'John, indeed, did baptize with a baptism of reformation, saying to the people that in him who is coming after him they should believe -- that is, in the Christ -- Jesus;'"
44,19,5,"and they, having heard, were baptized -- to the name of the Lord Jesus,"
44,19,6,"and Paul having laid on them"
44,19,7,"and all the men were, as it were, twelve."
44,19,8,"And having gone into the synagogue, he was speaking boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading the things concerning the reign of God,"
44,19,9,"and when certain were hardened and were disbelieving, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, having departed from them, he did separate the disciples, every day reasoning in the school of a certain Tyrannus."
44,19,10,"And this happened for two years so that all those dwelling in Asia did hear the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks,"
44,19,11,"mighty works also -- not common -- was God working through the hands of Paul,"
44,19,12,"so that even unto the ailing were brought from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the sicknesses departed from them; the evil spirits also went forth from them."
44,19,13,"And certain of the wandering exorcist Jews, took upon"
44,19,14,"and there were certain -- seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest -- who are doing this thing;"
44,19,15,"and the evil spirit, answering, said, 'Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; and you -- who are you?'"
44,19,16,"And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaping upon them, and having overcome them, prevailed against them, so that naked and wounded they did flee out of that house,"
44,19,17,"and this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who are dwelling at Ephesus, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified,"
44,19,18,"many also of those who did believe were coming, confessing and declaring their acts,"
44,19,19,"and many of those who had practised the curious arts, having brought the books together, were burning"
44,19,20,"so powerfully was the word of God increasing and prevailing."
44,19,21,"And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in the Spirit, having gone through Macedonia and Achaia, to go on to Jerusalem, saying -- 'After my being there, it behooves me also to see Rome;'"
44,19,22,"and having sent to Macedonia two of those ministering to him -- Timotheus and Erastus -- he himself stayed a time in Asia."
44,19,23,"And there came, at that time, not a little stir about the way,"
44,19,24,"for a certain one, Demetrius by name, a worker in silver, making silver sanctuaries of Artemis, was bringing to the artificers gain not a little,"
44,19,25,"whom, having brought in a crowd together, and those who did work about such things, he said, 'Men, you know that by this work we have our wealth;"
44,19,26,"and you see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but almost in all Asia, this Paul, having persuaded, did turn away a great multitude, saying, that they are not gods who are made by hands;"
44,19,27,"and not only is this department in danger for us of coming into disregard, but also, that of the great goddess Artemis the temple is to be reckoned for nothing, and also her greatness is about to be brought down, whom all Asia and the world does worship.'"
44,19,28,"And they having heard, and having become full of wrath, were crying out, saying, 'Great"
44,19,29,"and the whole city was filled with confusion, they rushed also with one accord into the theatre, having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's fellow-travellers."
44,19,30,"And on Paul's purposing to enter in unto the populace, the disciples were not suffering him,"
44,19,31,"and certain also of the chief men of Asia, being his friends, having sent unto him, were entreating him not to venture himself into the theatre."
44,19,32,"Some indeed, therefore, were calling out one thing, and some another, for the assembly was confused, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together;"
44,19,33,"and out of the multitude they put forward Alexander -- the Jews thrusting him forward -- and Alexander having beckoned with the hand, wished to make defence to the populace,"
44,19,34,"and having known that he is a Jew, one voice came out of all, for about two hours, crying, 'Great"
44,19,35,"And the public clerk having quieted the multitude, said, 'Men, Ephesians, why, who is the man that does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a devotee of the great goddess Artemis, and of that which fell down from Zeus?"
44,19,36,"these things, then, not being to be gainsaid, it is necessary for you to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly."
44,19,37,"'For you brought these men, who are neither temple-robbers nor speaking evil of your goddess;"
44,19,38,"if indeed, therefore, Demetrius and the artificers with him with any one have a matter, court"
44,19,39,"'And if you seek after anything concerning other matters, in the legal assembly it shall be determined;"
44,19,40,"for we are also in peril of being accused of insurrection in regard to this day, there being no occasion by which we shall be able to give an account of this concourse;'"
44,19,41,"and these things having said, he dismissed the assembly."
44,20,1,"And after the ceasing of the tumult, Paul having called near the disciples, and having embraced"
44,20,2,"and having gone through those parts, and having exhorted them with many words, he came to Greece;"
44,20,3,"having made also three months'"
44,20,4,"And there were accompanying him unto Asia, Sopater of Berea, and of Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus, and of Asiatics Tychicus and Trophimus;"
44,20,5,"these, having gone before, did remain for us in Troas,"
44,20,6,"and we sailed, after the days of the unleavened food, from Philippi, and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we abode seven days."
44,20,7,"And on the first of the week, the disciples having been gathered together to break bread, Paul was discoursing to them, about to depart on the morrow, he was also continuing the discourse till midnight,"
44,20,8,"and there were many lamps in the upper chamber where they were gathered together,"
44,20,9,"and there was sitting a certain youth, by name Eutychus, upon the window -- being borne down by a deep sleep, Paul discoursing long -- he having sunk down from the sleep, fell down from the third story, and was lifted up dead."
44,20,10,"And Paul, having gone down, fell upon him, and having embraced"
44,20,11,"and having come up, and having broken bread, and having tasted, for a long time also having talked -- till daylight, so he went forth,"
44,20,12,"and they brought up the lad alive, and were comforted in no ordinary measure."
44,20,13,"And we having gone before unto the ship, did sail to Assos, thence intending to take in Paul, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go on foot;"
44,20,14,"and when he met with us at Assos, having taken him up, we came to Mitylene,"
44,20,15,"and thence having sailed, on the morrow we came over-against Chios, and the next day we arrived at Samos, and having remained in Trogyllium, on the following day we came to Miletus,"
44,20,16,"for Paul decided to sail past Ephesus, that there may not be to him a loss of time in Asia, for he hasted, if it were possible for him, on the day of the Pentecost to be at Jerusalem."
44,20,17,"And from Miletus, having sent to Ephesus, he called for the elders of the assembly,"
44,20,18,"and when they were come unto him, he said to them, 'You -- you know from the first day in which I came to Asia, how, with you at all times I was;"
44,20,19,"serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and temptations, that befell me in the counsels of the Jews against"
44,20,20,"how nothing I did keep back of what things are profitable, not to declare to you, and to teach you publicly, and in every house,"
44,20,21,"testifying fully both to Jews and Greeks, toward God reformation, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,20,22,"'And now, lo, I -- bound in the Spirit -- go on to Jerusalem, the things that shall befall me in it not knowing,"
44,20,23,"save that the Holy Spirit in every city does testify fully, saying, that for me bonds and tribulations remain;"
44,20,24,"but I make account of none of these, neither do I count my life precious to myself, so that I finish my course with joy, and the ministration that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify fully the good news of the grace of God."
44,20,25,"'And now, lo, I have known that no more shall you see my face, -- you all among whom I did go preaching the reign of God;"
44,20,26,"therefore I take you to witness this day, that I"
44,20,27,"for I did not keep back from declaring to you all the counsel of God."
44,20,28,"'Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit made you overseers, to feed the assembly of God that He acquired through His own blood,"
44,20,29,"for I have known this, that there shall enter in, after my departing, grievous wolves unto you, not sparing the flock,"
44,20,30,"and of your own selves there shall arise men, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them."
44,20,31,"'Therefore, watch, remembering that three years, night and day, I did not cease with tears warning each one;"
44,20,32,"and now, I commend you, brethren, to God, and to the word of His grace, that is able to build up, and to give you an inheritance among all those sanctified."
44,20,33,"'The silver or gold or garments of no one did I covet;"
44,20,34,"and you yourselves know that to my necessities, and to those who were with me, minister did these hands;"
44,20,35,"all things I did show you, that, thus labouring, it behooves"
44,20,36,"And these things having said, having bowed his knees, with them all, he did pray,"
44,20,37,"and there came a great weeping to all, and having fallen upon the neck of Paul, they were kissing him,"
44,20,38,"sorrowing most of all for the word that he had said -- that they are about no more to see his face; and they were accompanying him to the ship."
44,21,1,"And it came to pass, at our sailing, having been parted from them, having run direct, we came to Coos, and the succeeding"
44,21,2,"and having found a ship passing over to Phenicia, having gone on board, we sailed,"
44,21,3,"and having discovered Cyprus, and having left it on the left, we were sailing to Syria, and did land at Tyre, for there was the ship discharging the lading."
44,21,4,"And having found out the disciples, we tarried there seven days, and they said to Paul, through the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem;"
44,21,5,"but when it came that we completed the days, having gone forth, we went on, all bringing us on the way, with women and children, unto the outside of the city, and having bowed the knees upon the shore, we prayed,"
44,21,6,"and having embraced one another, we embarked in the ship, and they returned to their own friends."
44,21,7,"And we, having finished the course, from Tyre came down to Ptolemais, and having saluted the brethren, we remained one day with them;"
44,21,8,"and on the morrow Paul and his company having gone forth, we came to Caesarea, and having entered into the house of Philip the evangelist -- who is of the seven -- we remained with him,"
44,21,9,"and this one had four daughters, virgins, prophesying."
44,21,10,"And we remaining many more days, there came down a certain one from Judea, a prophet, by name Agabus,"
44,21,11,"and he having come unto us, and having taken up the girdle of Paul, having bound also his own hands and feet, said, 'Thus said the Holy Spirit, The man whose is this girdle -- so shall the Jews in Jerusalem bind, and they shall deliver"
44,21,12,"And when we heard these things, we called upon"
44,21,13,"and Paul answered, 'What do you -- weeping, and crushing mine heart? for I, not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem, am ready, for the name of the Lord Jesus;'"
44,21,14,"and he not being persuaded, we were silent, saying, 'The will of the Lord be done.'"
44,21,15,"And after these days, having taken"
44,21,16,"and there went also of the disciples from Caesarea with us, bringing with them him with whom we may lodge, a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an aged disciple."
44,21,17,"And we having come to Jerusalem, the brethren did gladly receive us,"
44,21,18,"and on the morrow Paul was going in with us unto James, all the elders also came,"
44,21,19,"and having saluted them, he was declaring, one by one, each of the things God did among the nations through his ministration,"
44,21,20,"and they having heard, were glorifying the Lord. They said also to him, 'You see, brother, how many myriads there are of Jews who have believed, and all are zealous of the law,"
44,21,21,"and they are instructed concerning you, that apostasy from Moses you do teach to all Jews among the nations, saying -- Not to circumcise the children, nor after the customs to walk;"
44,21,22,"what then is it? certainly the multitude it behooves to come together, for they will hear that you hast come."
44,21,23,"'This, therefore, do that we say to you: We have four men having a vow on themselves,"
44,21,24,"these having taken, be purified with them, and be at expense with them, that they may shave the head, and all may know that the things of which they have been instructed concerning you are nothing, but you do walk -- yourself also -- the law keeping."
44,21,25,"'And concerning those of the nations who have believed, we have written, having given judgment, that they observe no such thing, except to keep themselves both from idol-sacrifices, and blood, and a strangled thing, and whoredom.'"
44,21,26,"Then Paul, having taken the men, on the following day, with them having purified himself, was entering into the temple, announcing the fulfillment of the days of the purification, till the offering was offered for each one of them."
44,21,27,"And, as the seven days were about to be fully ended, the Jews from Asia having beheld him in the temple, were stirring up all the multitude, and they laid hands upon him,"
44,21,28,"crying out, 'Men, Israelites, help! this is the man who, against the people, and the law, and this place, all everywhere is teaching; and further, also, Greeks he brought into the temple, and has defiled this holy place;'"
44,21,29,"for they had seen before Trophimus, the Ephesian, in the city with him, whom they were supposing that Paul brought into the temple."
44,21,30,"All the city also was moved and there was a running together of the people, and having laid hold on Paul, they were drawing him out of the temple, and immediately were the doors shut,"
44,21,31,"and they seeking to kill him, a rumour came to the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem has been thrown into confusion,"
44,21,32,"who, at once, having taken soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them, and they having seen the chief captain and the soldiers, did leave off beating Paul."
44,21,33,"Then the chief captain, having come near, took him, and commanded"
44,21,34,"and some were crying out one thing, and some another, among the multitude, and not being able to know the certainty because of the tumult, he commanded him to be carried to the castle,"
44,21,35,"and when he came upon the steps, it happened he was borne by the soldiers, because of the violence of the multitude,"
44,21,36,"for the crowd of the people was following after, crying, 'Away with him.'"
44,21,37,"And Paul being about to be led into the castle, said to the chief captain, 'Is it permitted to me to say anything unto you?' and he said, 'Greek do you know?"
44,21,38,"are not you, then, the Egyptian who before these days made an uprising, and did lead into the desert the four thousand men of the assassins?'"
44,21,39,"And Paul said, 'I, indeed, am a man, a Jew, of Tarsus of Cilicia, of no mean city a citizen; and I beseech you, suffer me to speak unto the people.'"
44,21,40,"And he having given him leave, Paul having stood upon the stairs, did beckon with the hand to the people, and there having been a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew dialect, saying:"
44,22,1,"'Men, brethren, and fathers, hear my defence now unto you;' --"
44,22,2,"and they having heard that in the Hebrew dialect he was speaking to them, gave the more silence, and he said, --"
44,22,3,"'I, indeed, am a man, a Jew, having been born in Tarsus of Cilicia, and brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, having been taught according to the exactitude of a law of the fathers, being zealous of God, as all you are to-day."
44,22,4,"'And this way I persecuted unto death, binding and delivering up to prisons both men and women,"
44,22,5,"as also the chief priest does testify to me, and all the eldership; from whom also having received letters unto the brethren, to Damascus, I was going on, to bring also those there bound to Jerusalem that they might be punished,"
44,22,6,"and it came to pass, in my going on and coming near to Damascus, about noon, suddenly out of the heaven there shone a great light round about me,"
44,22,7,"I fell also to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me,"
44,22,8,"'And I answered, Who are you, Lord? and he said unto me,"
44,22,9,"and they who are with me the light did see, and became afraid, and the voice they heard not of him who is speaking to me --"
44,22,10,"and I said, What shall I do, Lord? and the Lord said unto me,"
44,22,11,"'And when I did not see from the glory of that light, being led by the hand by those who are with me, I came to Damascus,"
44,22,12,"and a certain one, Ananias, a pious man according to the law, being testified to by all the Jews dwelling"
44,22,13,"having come unto me and stood by"
44,22,14,"and he said, The God of our fathers did choose you beforehand to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice out of his mouth,"
44,22,15,"because you shall be his witness unto all men of what you hast seen and heard;"
44,22,16,"and now, why tarry you? having risen, baptize yourself, and wash away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord."
44,22,17,"'And it came to pass when I returned to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, I came into a trance,"
44,22,18,"and I saw him saying to me,"
44,22,19,"and I said, Lord, they -- they know that I was imprisoning and was scourging in every synagogue those believing on you;"
44,22,20,"and when the blood of your witness Stephen was being poured forth, I also was standing by and assenting to his death, and keeping the garments of those putting him to death;"
44,22,21,"and he said unto me,"
44,22,22,"And they were hearing him unto this word, and they lifted up their voice, saying, 'Away from the earth with such an one; for it is not fit for him to live.'"
44,22,23,"And they crying out and casting up their garments, and throwing dust into the air,"
44,22,24,"the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, saying, 'By scourges let him be examined;' that he might know for what cause they were crying so against him."
44,22,25,"And as he was stretching him with the thongs, Paul said unto the centurion who was standing by, 'A man, a Roman, uncondemned -- is it lawful to you to scourge;'"
44,22,26,"and the centurion having heard, having gone near to the chief captain, told, saying, 'Take heed what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman;'"
44,22,27,"and the chief captain having come near, said to him, 'Tell me, are you a Roman?' and he said, 'Yes;'"
44,22,28,"and the chief captain answered, 'I, with a great sum, did obtain this citizenship;' but Paul said, 'But I have been even born"
44,22,29,"Immediately, therefore, they departed from him who are about to examine him, and the chief captain also was afraid, having learned that he is a Roman, and because he had bound him,"
44,22,30,"and on the morrow, intending to know the certainty therefore he is accused by the Jews, he did loose him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their sanhedrin to come, and having brought down Paul, he set"
44,23,1,"And Paul having earnestly beheld the sanhedrin, said, 'Men, brethren, I in all good conscience have lived to God unto this day;'"
44,23,2,"and the chief priest Ananias commanded those standing by him to smite him on the mouth,"
44,23,3,"then Paul said unto him, 'God is about to smite you, you whitewashed wall, and you -- you do sit judging me according to the law, and, violating law, do order me to be smitten!'"
44,23,4,"And those who stood by said, 'The chief priest of God do you revile?'"
44,23,5,"and Paul said, 'I did not know, brethren, that he is chief priest: for it has been written, Of the ruler of your people you shall not speak evil;'"
44,23,6,"and Paul having known that the one part are Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out in the sanhedrin, 'Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee -- son of a Pharisee -- concerning hope and rising again of dead men I am judged.'"
44,23,7,"And he having spoken this, there came a dissension of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees, and the crowd was divided,"
44,23,8,"for Sadducees, indeed, say there is no rising again, nor messenger, nor spirit, but Pharisees confess both."
44,23,9,"And there came a great cry, and the scribes of the Pharisees' part having arisen, were striving, saying, 'No evil do we find in this man; and if a spirit spake to him, or a messenger, we may not fight against God;'"
44,23,10,"and a great dissension having come, the chief captain having been afraid lest Paul may be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the soldiery, having gone down, to take him by force out of the midst of them, and to bring"
44,23,11,"And on the following night, the Lord having stood by him, said,"
44,23,12,"And day having come, certain of the Jews having made a concourse, did anathematize themselves, saying neither to eat nor to drink till they may kill Paul;"
44,23,13,"and they were more than forty who made this conspiracy by oath,"
44,23,14,"who having come near to the chief priests and to the elders said, 'With an anathema we did anathematize ourselves -- to taste nothing till we have killed Paul;"
44,23,15,"now, therefore, you, signify you to the chief captain, with the sanhedrin, that to-morrow he may bring him down unto you, as being about to know more exactly the things concerning him; and we, before his coming near, are ready to put him to death.'"
44,23,16,"And the son of Paul's sister having heard of the lying in wait, having gone and entered into the castle, told Paul,"
44,23,17,"and Paul having called near one of the centurions, said, 'This young man lead unto the chief captain, for he has something to tell him.'"
44,23,18,"He indeed, then, having taken him, brought him unto the chief captain, and said, 'The prisoner Paul, having called me near, asked"
44,23,19,"And the chief captain having taken him by the hand, and having withdrawn by themselves, inquired, 'What is that which you hast to tell me?'"
44,23,20,"and he said -- 'The Jews agreed to request you, that to-morrow to the sanhedrin you may bring down Paul, as being about to enquire something more exactly concerning him;"
44,23,21,"you, therefore, may you not yield to them, for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who did anathematize themselves -- not to eat nor to drink till they kill him, and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.'"
44,23,22,"The chief captain, then, indeed, let the young man go, having charged"
44,23,23,"and having called near a certain two of the centurions, he said, 'Make ready soldiers two hundred, that they may go on unto Caesarea, and horsemen seventy, and spearmen two hundred, from the third hour of the night;"
44,23,24,"beasts also provide, that, having set Paul on, they may bring him safe unto Felix the governor;'"
44,23,25,"he having written a letter after this description:"
44,23,26,"'Claudius Lysias, to the most noble governor Felix, hail:"
44,23,27,"This man having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them -- having come with the soldiery, I rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman;"
44,23,28,"and, intending to know the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their sanhedrin,"
44,23,29,"whom I found accused concerning questions of their law, and having no accusation worthy of death or bonds;"
44,23,30,"and a plot having been intimated to me against this man -- about to be of the Jews -- at once I sent unto you, having given command also to the accusers to say the things against him before you; be strong.'"
44,23,31,"Then, indeed, the soldiers according to that directed them, having taken up Paul, brought him through the night to Antipatris,"
44,23,32,"and on the morrow, having suffered the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the castle;"
44,23,33,"those having entered into Caesarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, did present also Paul to him."
44,23,34,"And the governor having read"
44,23,35,"'I will hear you -- said he -- when your accusers also may have come;' he also commanded him to be kept in the praetorium of Herod."
44,24,1,"And after five days came down the chief priest Ananias, with the elders, and a certain orator -- Tertullus, and they made manifest to the governor"
44,24,2,"and he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse"
44,24,3,"always, also, and everywhere we receive it, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness;"
44,24,4,"and that I may not be further tedious to you, I pray you to hear us concisely in your gentleness;"
44,24,5,"for having found this man a pestilence, and moving a dissension to all the Jews through the world -- a ringleader also of the sect of the Nazarenes --"
44,24,6,"who also the temple did try to profane, whom also we took, and according to our law did wish to judge,"
44,24,7,"and Lysias the chief captain having come near, with much violence, out of our hands did take away,"
44,24,8,"having commanded his accusers to come to you, from whom you may be able, yourself having examined, to know concerning all these things of which we accuse him;'"
44,24,9,"and the Jews also agreed, professing these things to be so."
44,24,10,"And Paul answered -- the governor having beckoned to him to speak -- 'Knowing"
44,24,11,"you being able to know that it is not more than twelve days to me since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,"
44,24,12,"and neither in the temple did they find me reasoning with any one, or making a dissension of the multitude, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city;"
44,24,13,"nor are they able to prove against me the things concerning which they now accuse me."
44,24,14,"'And I confess this to you, that, according to the way that they call a sect, so serve I the God of the fathers, believing all things that in the law and the prophets have been written,"
44,24,15,"having hope toward God, which they themselves also wait for,"
44,24,16,"and in this I do exercise myself, to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always."
44,24,17,"'And after many years I came, about to do kind acts to my nation, and offerings,"
44,24,18,"in which certain Jews from Asia did find me purified in the temple, not with multitude, nor with tumult,"
44,24,19,"whom it behooves to be present before you, and to accuse, if they had anything against me,"
44,24,20,"or let these same say if they found any unrighteousness in me in my standing before the sanhedrin,"
44,24,21,"except concerning this one voice, in which I cried, standing among them -- Concerning a rising again of the dead I am judged to-day by you.'"
44,24,22,"And having heard these things, Felix delayed them -- having known more exactly of the things concerning the way -- saying, 'When Lysias the chief captain may come down, I will know fully the things concerning you;'"
44,24,23,"having given also a direction to the centurion to keep Paul, to let"
44,24,24,"And after certain days, Felix having come with Drusilla his wife, being a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith toward Christ,"
44,24,25,"and he reasoning concerning righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment that is about to be, Felix, having become afraid, answered, 'For the present be going, and having got time, I will call for you;'"
44,24,26,"and at the same time also hoping that money shall be given to him by Paul, that he may release him, therefore, also sending for him the oftener, he was conversing with him;"
44,24,27,"and two years having been fulfilled, Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus; Felix also willing to lay a favour on the Jews, left Paul bound."
44,25,1,"Festus, therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea,"
44,25,2,"and the chief priest and the principal men of the Jews made manifest to him"
44,25,3,"asking favour against him, that he may send for him to Jerusalem, making an ambush to put him to death in the way."
44,25,4,"Then, indeed, Festus answered that Paul is kept in Caesarea, and himself is about speedily to go on thither,"
44,25,5,"'Therefore those able among you -- said he -- having come down together, if there be anything in this man -- let them accuse him;'"
44,25,6,"and having tarried among them more than ten days, having gone down to Caesarea, on the morrow having sat upon the tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought;"
44,25,7,"and he having come, there stood round about the Jews who have come down from Jerusalem -- many and weighty charges they are bringing against Paul, which they were not able to prove,"
44,25,8,"he making defence -- 'Neither in regard to the law of the Jews, nor in regard to the temple, nor in regard to Caesar -- did I commit any sin.'"
44,25,9,"And Festus willing to lay on the Jews a favour, answering Paul, said, 'Art you willing, to Jerusalem having gone up, there concerning these things to be judged before me?'"
44,25,10,"and Paul said, 'At the tribunal of Caesar I am standing, where it behooves me to be judged; to Jews I did no unrighteousness, as you do also very well know;"
44,25,11,"for if indeed I am unrighteous, and anything worthy of death have done, I deprecate not to die; and if there is none of the things of which these accuse me, no one is able to make a favour of me to them; to Caesar I appeal!'"
44,25,12,"then Festus, having communed with the council, answered, 'To Caesar you hast appealed; to Caesar you shall go.'"
44,25,13,"And certain days having passed, Agrippa the king, and Bernice, came down to Caesarea saluting Festus,"
44,25,14,"and as they were continuing there more days, Festus submitted to the king the things concerning Paul, saying, 'There is a certain man, left by Felix, a prisoner,"
44,25,15,"about whom, in my being at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid information, asking a decision against him,"
44,25,16,"unto whom I answered, that it is not a custom of Romans to make a favour of any man to die, before that he who is accused may have the accusers face to face, and may receive place of defence in regard to the charge laid against"
44,25,17,"'They, therefore, having come together -- I, making no delay, on the succeeding"
44,25,18,"concerning whom the accusers, having stood up, were bringing against"
44,25,19,"but certain questions concerning their own religion they had against him, and concerning a certain Jesus who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive;"
44,25,20,"and I, doubting in regard to the question concerning this, said, If he would wish to go on to Jerusalem, and there to be judged concerning these things --"
44,25,21,"but Paul having appealed to be kept to the hearing of Sebastus, I did command him to be kept till I might send him unto Caesar.'"
44,25,22,"And Agrippa said unto Festus, 'I was wishing also myself to hear the man;' and he said, 'To-morrow you shall hear him;'"
44,25,23,"on the morrow, therefore -- on the coming of Agrippa and Bernice with much display, and they having entered into the audience chamber, with the chief captains also, and the principal men of the city, and Festus having ordered -- Paul was brought forth."
44,25,24,"And Festus said, 'King Agrippa, and all men who are present with us, you see this one, about whom all the multitude of the Jews did deal with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out, He ought not to live any longer;"
44,25,25,"and I, having found him to have done nothing worthy of death, and he also himself having appealed to Sebastus, I decided to send him,"
44,25,26,"concerning whom I have no certain thing to write to"
44,25,27,"for it does seem to me irrational, sending a prisoner, not also to signify the charges against him.'"
44,26,1,"And Agrippa said unto Paul, 'It is permitted to you to speak for yourself;' then Paul having stretched forth the hand, was making a defence:"
44,26,2,"'Concerning all things of which I am accused by Jews, king Agrippa, I have thought myself happy, being about to make a defence before you to-day,"
44,26,3,"especially knowing you to be acquainted with all things -- both customs and questions -- among Jews; therefore, I beseech you, patiently to hear me."
44,26,4,"'The manner of my life then, indeed, from youth -- which from the beginning was among my nation, in Jerusalem -- know do all the Jews,"
44,26,5,"knowing me before from the first, (if they may be willing to testify,) that after the most exact sect of our worship, I lived a Pharisee;"
44,26,6,"and now for the hope of the promise made to the fathers by God, I have stood judged,"
44,26,7,"to which our twelve tribes, intently night and day serving, do hope to come, concerning which hope I am accused, king Agrippa, by the Jews;"
44,26,8,"why is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?"
44,26,9,"'I, indeed, therefore, thought with myself, that against the name of Jesus of Nazareth it behoved"
44,26,10,"which also I did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I in prison did shut up, from the chief priests having received the authority; they also being put to death, I gave my vote against them,"
44,26,11,"and in every synagogue, often punishing them, I was constraining"
44,26,12,"'In which things, also, going on to Damascus -- with authority and commission from the chief priests --"
44,26,13,"at mid-day, I saw in the way, O king, out of heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me a light -- and those going on with me;"
44,26,14,"and we all having fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect,"
44,26,15,"'And I said, Who are you, Lord? and he said,"
44,26,16,""
44,26,17,""
44,26,18,""
44,26,19,"'Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,"
44,26,20,"but to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem, to all the region also of Judea, and to the nations, I was preaching to reform, and to turn back unto God, doing works worthy of reformation;"
44,26,21,"because of these things the Jews -- having caught me in the temple -- were endeavouring to kill"
44,26,22,"'Having obtained, therefore, help from God, till this day, I have stood witnessing both to small and to great, saying nothing besides the things that both the prophets and Moses spake of as about to come,"
44,26,23,"that the Christ is to suffer, whether first by a rising from the dead, he is about to proclaim light to the people and to the nations.'"
44,26,24,"And, he thus making a defence, Festus with a loud voice said, 'You are mad, Paul; much learning does turn you mad;'"
44,26,25,"and he said, 'I am not mad, most noble Festus, but of truth and soberness the sayings I speak forth;"
44,26,26,"for the king does know concerning these things, before whom also I speak boldly, for none of these things, I am persuaded, are hidden from him; for this thing has not been done in a corner;"
44,26,27,"you do believe, king Agrippa, the prophets? I have known that you do believe!'"
44,26,28,"And Agrippa said unto Paul, 'In a little you do persuade me to become a Christian!'"
44,26,29,"and Paul said, 'I would have wished to God, both in a little, and in much, not only you, but also all those hearing me to-day, to become such as I also am -- except these bonds.'"
44,26,30,"And, he having spoken these things, the king rose up, and the governor, Bernice also, and those sitting with them,"
44,26,31,"and having withdrawn, they were speaking unto one another, saying -- 'This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds;'"
44,26,32,"and Agrippa said to Festus, 'This man might have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.'"
44,27,1,"And when our sailing to Italy was determined, they were delivering up both Paul and certain others, prisoners, to a centurion, by name Julius, of the band of Sebastus,"
44,27,2,"and having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium, we, being about to sail by the coasts of Asia, did set sail, there being with us Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica,"
44,27,3,"on the next"
44,27,4,"And thence, having set sail, we sailed under Cyprus, because of the winds being contrary,"
44,27,5,"and having sailed over the sea over-against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myria of Lycia,"
44,27,6,"and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria, sailing to Italy, did put us into it,"
44,27,7,"and having sailed slowly many days, and with difficulty coming over-against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone,"
44,27,8,"and hardly passing it, we came to a certain place called 'Fair Havens,' near to which was the city"
44,27,9,"And much time being spent, and the sailing being now dangerous -- because of the fast also being already past -- Paul was admonishing,"
44,27,10,"saying to them, 'Men, I perceive that with hurt, and much damage, not only of the lading and of the ship, but also of our lives -- the voyage is about to be;'"
44,27,11,"but the centurion to the pilot and to the ship owner gave credence more than to the things spoken by Paul;"
44,27,12,"and the haven being incommodious to winter in, the more part gave counsel to sail thence also, if by any means they might be able, having attained to Phenice,"
44,27,13,"and a south wind blowing softly, having thought they had obtained"
44,27,14,"and not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, that is called Euroclydon,"
44,27,15,"and the ship being caught, and not being able to bear up against the wind, having given"
44,27,16,"and having run under a certain little isle, called Clauda, we were hardly able to become masters of the boat,"
44,27,17,"which having taken up, they were using helps, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest they may fall on the quicksand, having let down the mast -- so were borne on."
44,27,18,"And we, being exceedingly tempest-tossed, the succeeding"
44,27,19,"and on the third"
44,27,20,"and neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and not a little tempest lying upon us, thenceforth all hope was taken away of our being saved."
44,27,21,"And there having been long fasting, then Paul having stood in the midst of them, said, 'It behoved"
44,27,22,"and now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall be no loss of life among you -- but of the ship;"
44,27,23,"for there stood by me this night a messenger of God -- whose I am, and whom I serve --"
44,27,24,"saying, Be not afraid Paul; before Caesar it behooves you to stand; and, lo, God has granted to you all those sailing with you;"
44,27,25,"therefore be of good cheer, men! for I believe God, that so it shall be, even as it has been spoken to me,"
44,27,26,"and on a certain island it behooves us to be cast.'"
44,27,27,"And when the fourteenth night came -- we being borne up and down in the Adria -- toward the middle of the night the sailors were supposing that some country drew near to them;"
44,27,28,"and having sounded they found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther, and again having sounded, they found fifteen fathoms,"
44,27,29,"and fearing lest on rough places we may fall, out of the stern having cast four anchors, they were wishing day to come."
44,27,30,"And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat to the sea, in pretence as"
44,27,31,"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, 'If these do not remain in the ship -- you are not able to be saved;'"
44,27,32,"then the soldiers did cut off the ropes of the boat, and suffered it to fall off."
44,27,33,"And till the day was about to be, Paul was calling upon all to partake of nourishment, saying, 'Fourteen days to-day, waiting, you continue fasting, having taken nothing,"
44,27,34,"therefore I call upon you to take nourishment, for this is for your safety, for of not one of you shall a hair from the head fall;'"
44,27,35,"and having said these things, and having taken bread, he gave thanks to God before all, and having broken"
44,27,36,"and all having become of good cheer, themselves also took food,"
44,27,37,"(and we were -- all the souls in the ship -- two hundred, seventy and six),"
44,27,38,"and having eaten sufficient nourishment, they were lightening the ship, casting forth the wheat into the sea."
44,27,39,"And when the day came, they were not discerning the land, but a certain creek were perceiving having a beach, into which they took counsel, if possible, to thrust forward the ship,"
44,27,40,"and the anchors having taken up, they were committing"
44,27,41,"and having fallen into a place of two seas, they ran the ship aground, and the fore-part, indeed, having stuck fast, did remain immoveable, but the hinder-part was broken by the violence of the waves."
44,27,42,"And the soldiers' counsel was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one having swam out should escape,"
44,27,43,"but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, hindered them from the counsel, and did command those able to swim, having cast themselves out first -- to get unto the land,"
44,27,44,"and the rest, some indeed upon boards, and some upon certain things of the ship; and thus it came to pass that all came safe unto the land."
44,28,1,"And having been saved, then they knew that the island is called Melita,"
44,28,2,"and the foreigners were showing us no ordinary kindness, for having kindled a fire, they received us all, because of the pressing rain, and because of the cold;"
44,28,3,"but Paul having gathered together a quantity of sticks, and having laid"
44,28,4,"And when the foreigners saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said unto one another, 'Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, having been saved out of the sea, the justice did not suffer to live;'"
44,28,5,"he then, indeed, having shaken off the beast into the fire, suffered no evil,"
44,28,6,"and they were expecting him to be about to be inflamed, or to fall down suddenly dead, and they, expecting"
44,28,7,"And in the neighborhood of that place were lands of the principal man of the island, by name Publius, who, having received us, three days did courteously lodge"
44,28,8,"and it came to pass, the father of Publius with feverish heats and dysentery pressed, was laid, unto whom Paul having entered, and having prayed, having laid"
44,28,9,"this, therefore, being done, the others also in the island having infirmities were coming and were healed;"
44,28,10,"who also with many honours did honour us, and we setting sail -- they were lading"
44,28,11,"And after three months, we set sail in a ship (that had wintered in the isle) of Alexandria, with the sign Dioscuri,"
44,28,12,"and having landed at Syracuse, we remained three days,"
44,28,13,"thence having gone round, we came to Rhegium, and after one day, a south wind having sprung up, the second"
44,28,14,"where, having found brethren, we were called upon to remain with them seven days, and thus to Rome we came;"
44,28,15,"and thence, the brethren having heard the things concerning us, came forth to meet us, unto Appii Forum, and Three Taverns -- whom Paul having seen, having given thanks to God, took courage."
44,28,16,"And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered up the prisoners to the captain of the barrack, but Paul was suffered to remain by himself, with the soldier guarding him."
44,28,17,"And it came to pass after three days, Paul called together those who are the principal men of the Jews, and they having come together, he said unto them: 'Men, brethren, I -- having done nothing contrary to the people, or to the customs of the fathers -- a prisoner from Jerusalem, was delivered up to the hands of the Romans;"
44,28,18,"who, having examined me, were wishing to release"
44,28,19,"and the Jews having spoken against"
44,28,20,"for this cause, therefore, I called for you to see and to speak with"
44,28,21,"And they said unto him, 'We did neither receive letters concerning you from Judea, nor did any one who came of the brethren declare or speak any evil concerning you,"
44,28,22,"and we think it good from you to hear what you do think, for, indeed, concerning this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against;'"
44,28,23,"and having appointed him a day, they came, more of them unto him, to the lodging, to whom he was expounding, testifying fully the reign of God, persuading them also of the things concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and the prophets, from morning till evening,"
44,28,24,"and, some, indeed, were believing the things spoken, and some were not believing."
44,28,25,"And not being agreed with one another, they were going away, Paul having spoken one word -- 'Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,"
44,28,26,"saying, Go on unto this people and say, With hearing you shall hear, and you shall not understand, and seeing you shall see, and you shall not perceive,"
44,28,27,"for made gross was the heart of this people, and with the ears they heard heavily, and their eyes they did close, lest they may see with the eyes, and with the heart may understand, and be turned back, and I may heal them."
44,28,28,"'Be it known, therefore, to you, that to the nations was sent the salvation of God, these also will hear it;'"
44,28,29,"and he having said these things, the Jews went away, having much disputation among themselves;"
44,28,30,"and Paul remained an entire two years in his own hired"
44,28,31,"preaching the reign of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness -- unforbidden."
45,1,1,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, having been separated to the good news of God --"
45,1,2,"which He announced before through His prophets in holy writings --"
45,1,3,"concerning His Son, (who is come of the seed of David according to the flesh,"
45,1,4,"who is marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of sanctification, by the rising again from the dead,) Jesus Christ our Lord;"
45,1,5,"through whom we did receive grace and apostleship, for obedience of faith among all the nations, in behalf of his name;"
45,1,6,"among whom are also you, the called of Jesus Christ;"
45,1,7,"to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints; Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and"
45,1,8,"First, indeed, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world;"
45,1,9,"for God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you,"
45,1,10,"always in my prayers beseeching, if by any means now at length I shall have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to come unto you,"
45,1,11,"for I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that you may be established;"
45,1,12,"and that is, that I may be comforted together among you, through the faith in one another, both yours and mine."
45,1,13,"And I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that many times I did purpose to come unto you -- and was hindered till the present time -- that some fruit I might have also among you, even as also among the other nations."
45,1,14,"Both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to wise and to thoughtless, I am a debtor,"
45,1,15,"so, as much as in me is, I am ready also to you who"
45,1,16,"for I am not ashamed of the good news of the Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation to every one who is believing, both to Jew first, and to Greek."
45,1,17,"For the righteousness of God in it is revealed from faith to faith, according as it has been written, 'And the righteous one by faith shall live,'"
45,1,18,"for revealed is the wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety and unrighteousness of men, holding down the truth in unrighteousness."
45,1,19,"Because that which is known of God is manifest among them, for God did manifest"
45,1,20,"for the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world, by the things made being understood, are plainly seen, both His eternal power and Godhead -- to their being inexcusable;"
45,1,21,"because, having known God they did not glorify"
45,1,22,"professing to be wise, they were made fools,"
45,1,23,"and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of fowls, and of quadrupeds, and of reptiles."
45,1,24,"Therefore also God did give them up, in the desires of their hearts, to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies among themselves;"
45,1,25,"who did change the truth of God into a falsehood, and did honour and serve the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed to the ages. Amen."
45,1,26,"Because of this did God give them up to dishonorable affections, for even their females did change the natural use into that against nature;"
45,1,27,"and in like manner also the males having left the natural use of the female, did burn in their longing toward one another; males with males working shame, and the recompense of their error that was fit, in themselves receiving."
45,1,28,"And, according as they did not approve of having God in knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mind, to do the things not seemly;"
45,1,29,"having been filled with all unrighteousness, whoredom, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil dispositions; whisperers,"
45,1,30,"evil-speakers, God-haters, insulting, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
45,1,31,"unintelligent, faithless, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful;"
45,1,32,"who the righteous judgment of God having known -- that those practising such things are worthy of death -- not only do them, but also have delight with those practising them."
45,2,1,"Therefore, you are inexcusable, O man -- every one who is judging -- for in that in which you do judge the other, yourself you do condemn, for the same things you do practise who are judging,"
45,2,2,"and we have known that the judgment of God is according to truth, upon those practising such things."
45,2,3,"And do you think this, O man, who are judging those who such things are practising, and are doing them, that you shall escape the judgment of God?"
45,2,4,"or the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, do you despise? -- not knowing that the goodness of God does lead you to reformation!"
45,2,5,"But, according to your hardness and impenitent heart, you do treasure up to yourself wrath, in a day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God,"
45,2,6,"who shall render to each according to his works;"
45,2,7,"to those, indeed, who in continuance of a good work, do seek glory, and honour, and incorruptibility -- life age-during;"
45,2,8,"and to those contentious, and disobedient, indeed, to the truth, and obeying the unrighteousness -- indignation and wrath,"
45,2,9,"tribulation and distress, upon every soul of man that is working the evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek;"
45,2,10,"and glory, and honour, and peace, to every one who is working the good, both to Jew first, and to Greek."
45,2,11,"For there is no acceptance of faces with God,"
45,2,12,"for as many as without law did sin, without law also shall perish, and as many as did sin in law, through law shall be judged,"
45,2,13,"for not the hearers of the law"
45,2,14,"For, when nations that have not a law, by nature may do the things of the law, these not having a law -- to themselves are a law;"
45,2,15,"who do show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also witnessing with them, and between one another the thoughts accusing or else defending,"
45,2,16,"in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my good news, through Jesus Christ."
45,2,17,"Lo, you are named a Jew, and do rest upon the law, and do boast in God,"
45,2,18,"and do know the will, and do approve the distinctions, being instructed out of the law,"
45,2,19,"and have confidence that you yourself are a leader of blind ones, a light of those in darkness,"
45,2,20,"an instructor of foolish ones, a teacher of babes, having the form of the knowledge and of the truth in the law."
45,2,21,"You, then, who are teaching another, yourself do you not teach?"
45,2,22,"you who are preaching not to steal, do you steal? you who are saying not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? you who are abhorring the idols, do you rob temples?"
45,2,23,"you who in the law do boast, through the transgression of the law God do you dishonour?"
45,2,24,"for the name of God because of you is evil spoken of among the nations, according as it has been written."
45,2,25,"For circumcision, indeed, does profit, if law you may practise, but if a transgressor of law you may be, your circumcision has become uncircumcision."
45,2,26,"If, therefore the uncircumcision the righteousness of the law may keep, shall not his uncircumcision for circumcision be reckoned?"
45,2,27,"and the uncircumcision, by nature, fulfilling the law, shall judge you who, through letter and circumcision,"
45,2,28,"For he is not a Jew who is"
45,2,29,"but a Jew"
45,3,1,"What, then,"
45,3,2,"much in every way; for first, indeed, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God;"
45,3,3,"for what, if certain were faithless? shall their faithlessness the faithfulness of God make useless?"
45,3,4,"let it not be! and let God become true, and every man false, according as it has been written, 'That You may be declared righteous in Your words, and may overcome in Your being judged.'"
45,3,5,"And, if our unrighteousness God's righteousness does establish, what shall we say? is God unrighteous who is inflicting the wrath? (after the manner of a man I speak)"
45,3,6,"let it not be! since how shall God judge the world?"
45,3,7,"for if the truth of God in my falsehood did more abound to His glory, why yet am I also as a sinner judged?"
45,3,8,"and not, as we are evil spoken of, and as certain affirm us to say -- 'We may do the evil things, that the good ones may come?' whose judgment is righteous."
45,3,9,"What, then? are we better? not at all! for we did before charge both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin,"
45,3,10,"according as it has been written -- 'There is none righteous, not even one;"
45,3,11,"There is none who is understanding, there is none who is seeking after God."
45,3,12,"All did go out of the way, together they became unprofitable, there is none doing good, there is not even one."
45,3,13,"A sepulchre opened"
45,3,14,"Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."
45,3,15,"Swift"
45,3,16,"Ruin and misery"
45,3,17,"And a way of peace they did not know."
45,3,18,"There is no fear of God before their eyes.'"
45,3,19,"And we have known that as many things as the law says, to those in the law it does speak, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may come under judgment to God;"
45,3,20,"therefore by works of law shall no flesh be declared righteous before Him, for through law is a knowledge of sin."
45,3,21,"And now apart from law has the righteousness of God been manifested, testified to by the law and the prophets,"
45,3,22,"and the righteousness of God"
45,3,23,"for all did sin, and are come short of the glory of God --"
45,3,24,"being declared righteous freely by His grace through the redemption that"
45,3,25,"whom God did set forth a mercy seat, through the faith in his blood, for the showing forth of His righteousness, because of the passing over of the bygone sins in the forbearance of God --"
45,3,26,"for the showing forth of His righteousness in the present time, for His being righteous, and declaring him righteous who"
45,3,27,"Where then"
45,3,28,"therefore do we reckon a man to be declared righteous by faith, apart from works of law."
45,3,29,"The God of Jews only"
45,3,30,"yes, also of nations; since one"
45,3,31,"Law then do we make useless through the faith? let it not be! yea, we do establish law."
45,4,1,"What, then, shall we say Abraham our father, to have found, according to flesh?"
45,4,2,"for if Abraham by works was declared righteous, he has to boast -- but not before God;"
45,4,3,"for what does the writing say? 'And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;'"
45,4,4,"and to him who is working, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt;"
45,4,5,"and to him who is not working, and is believing upon Him who is declaring righteous the impious, his faith is reckoned -- to righteousness:"
45,4,6,"even as David also does speak of the happiness of the man to whom God does reckon righteousness apart from works:"
45,4,7,"'Happy they whose lawless acts were forgiven, and whose sins were covered;"
45,4,8,"happy the man to whom the Lord may not reckon sin.'"
45,4,9,""
45,4,10,"how then was it reckoned? he being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;"
45,4,11,"and a sign he did receive of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith in the uncircumcision, for his being father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for the righteousness also being reckoned to them,"
45,4,12,"and father of circumcision to those not of circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of the faith, that"
45,4,13,"For not through law"
45,4,14,"for if they who are of law"
45,4,15,"for the law does work wrath; for where law is not, neither"
45,4,16,"Because of this"
45,4,17,"who is father of us all (according as it has been written -- 'A father of many nations I have set you,') before Him whom he did believe -- God, who is quickening the dead, and is calling the things that be not as being."
45,4,18,"Who, against hope in hope did believe, for his becoming father of many nations according to that spoken: 'So shall your seed be;'"
45,4,19,"and not having been weak in the faith, he did not consider his own body, already become dead, (being about a hundred years old,) and the deadness of Sarah's womb,"
45,4,20,"and at the promise of God did not stagger in unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, having given glory to God,"
45,4,21,"and having been fully persuaded that what He has promised He is able also to do:"
45,4,22,"therefore also it was reckoned to him to righteousness."
45,4,23,"And it was not written on his account alone, that it was reckoned to him,"
45,4,24,"but also on ours, to whom it is about to be reckoned -- to us believing on Him who did raise up Jesus our Lord out of the dead,"
45,4,25,"who was delivered up because of our offences, and was raised up because of our being declared righteous."
45,5,1,"Having been declared righteous, then, by faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
45,5,2,"through whom also we have the access by the faith into this grace in which we have stood, and we boast on the hope of the glory of God."
45,5,3,"And not only"
45,5,4,"and the endurance, experience; and the experience, hope;"
45,5,5,"and the hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God has been poured forth in our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us."
45,5,6,"For in our being still ailing, Christ in due time did die for the impious;"
45,5,7,"for scarcely for a righteous man will any one die, for the good man perhaps some one also does dare to die;"
45,5,8,"and God does commend His own love to us, that, in our being still sinners, Christ did die for us;"
45,5,9,"much more, then, having been declared righteous now in his blood, we shall be saved through him from the wrath;"
45,5,10,"for if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in his life."
45,5,11,"And not only"
45,5,12,"because of this, even as through one man the sin did enter into the world, and through the sin the death; and thus to all men the death did pass through, for that all did sin;"
45,5,13,"for till law sin was in the world: and sin is not reckoned when there is not law;"
45,5,14,"but the death did reign from Adam till Moses, even upon those not having sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of him who is coming."
45,5,15,"But, not as the offence so also"
45,5,16,"and not as through one who did sin"
45,5,17,"for if by the offence of the one the death did reign through the one, much more those, who the abundance of the grace and of the free gift of the righteousness are receiving, in life shall reign through the one -- Jesus Christ."
45,5,18,"So, then, as through one offence to all men"
45,5,19,"for as through the disobedience of the one man, the many were constituted sinners: so also through the obedience of the one, shall the many be constituted righteous."
45,5,20,"And law came in, that the offence might abound, and where the sin did abound, the grace did overabound,"
45,5,21,"that even as the sin did reign in the death, so also the grace may reign, through righteousness, to life age-during, through Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,1,"What, then, shall we say? shall we continue in the sin that the grace may abound?"
45,6,2,"let it not be! we who died to the sin -- how shall we still live in it?"
45,6,3,"are you ignorant that we, as many as were baptized to Christ Jesus, to his death were baptized?"
45,6,4,"we were buried together, then, with him through the baptism to the death, that even as Christ was raised up out of the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we in newness of life might walk."
45,6,5,"For, if we have become planted together to the likeness of his death,"
45,6,6,"this knowing, that our old man was crucified with"
45,6,7,"for he who has died has been set free from the sin."
45,6,8,"And if we died with Christ, we believe that we also shall live with him,"
45,6,9,"knowing that Christ, having been raised up out of the dead, does no more die, death over him has no more lordship;"
45,6,10,"for in that he died, to the sin he died once, and in that he lives, he lives to God;"
45,6,11,"so also you, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to the sin, and living to God in Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,12,"Let not then the sin reign in your mortal body, to obey it in its desires;"
45,6,13,"neither present you your members instruments of unrighteousness to the sin, but present yourselves to God as living out of the dead, and your members instruments of righteousness to God;"
45,6,14,"for sin over you shall not have lordship, for you are not under law, but under grace."
45,6,15,"What then? shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? let it not be!"
45,6,16,"Have you not known that to whom you present yourselves servants for obedience, servants you are to him to whom you obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?"
45,6,17,"and thanks to God, that you were servants of the sin, and -- were obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were delivered up;"
45,6,18,"and having been freed from the sin, you became servants to the righteousness."
45,6,19,"In the manner of men I speak, because of the weakness of your flesh, for even as you did present your members servants to the uncleanness and to the lawlessness -- to the lawlessness, so now present your members servants to the righteousness -- to sanctification,"
45,6,20,"for when you were servants of the sin, you were free from the righteousness,"
45,6,21,"what fruit, therefore, were you having then, in the things of which you are now ashamed? for the end of those"
45,6,22,"And now, having been freed from the sin, and having become servants to God, you have your fruit -- to sanctification, and the end life age-during;"
45,6,23,"for the wages of the sin"
45,7,1,"Are you ignorant, brethren -- for to those knowing law I speak -- that the law has lordship over the man as long as he lives?"
45,7,2,"for the married woman to the living husband has been bound by law, and if the husband may die, she has been free from the law of the husband;"
45,7,3,"so, then, the husband being alive, an adulteress she shall be called if she may become another man's; and if the husband may die, she is free from the law, so as not to be an adulteress, having become another man's."
45,7,4,"So that, my brethren, you also were made dead to the law through the body of the Christ, for your becoming another's, who out of the dead was raised up, that we might bear fruit to God;"
45,7,5,"for when we were in the flesh, the passions of the sins, that"
45,7,6,"and now we have ceased from the law, that being dead in which we were held, so that we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter."
45,7,7,"What, then, shall we say? the law"
45,7,8,"'You shall not covet;' and the sin having received an opportunity, through the command, did work in me all covetousness -- for apart from law sin is dead."
45,7,9,"And I was alive apart from law once, and the command having come, the sin revived, and I died;"
45,7,10,"and the command that"
45,7,11,"for the sin, having received an opportunity, through the command, did deceive me, and through it did slay"
45,7,12,"so that the law, indeed,"
45,7,13,"That which is good then, to me has it become death? let it not be! but the sin, that it might appear sin, through the good, working death to me, that the sin might become exceeding sinful through the command,"
45,7,14,"for we have known that the law is spiritual, and I am fleshly, sold by the sin;"
45,7,15,"for that which I work, I do not acknowledge; for not what I will, this I practise, but what I hate, this I do."
45,7,16,"And if what I do not will, this I do, I consent to the law that"
45,7,17,"and now it is no longer I that work it, but the sin dwelling in me,"
45,7,18,"for I have known that there does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh, good: for to will is present with me, and to work that which is right I do not find,"
45,7,19,"for the good that I will, I do not; but the evil that I do not will, this I practise."
45,7,20,"And if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it, but the sin that is dwelling in me."
45,7,21,"I find, then, the law, that when I desire to do what is right, with me the evil is present,"
45,7,22,"for I delight in the law of God according to the inward man,"
45,7,23,"and I behold another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of the sin that"
45,7,24,"A wretched man I"
45,7,25,"I thank God -- through Jesus Christ our Lord; so then, I myself indeed with the mind do serve the law of God, and with the flesh, the law of sin."
45,8,1,"There is, then, now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit;"
45,8,2,"for the law of the Spirit of the life in Christ Jesus did set me free from the law of the sin and of the death;"
45,8,3,"for what the law was not able to do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, His own Son having sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, did condemn the sin in the flesh,"
45,8,4,"that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit."
45,8,5,"For those who are according to the flesh, the things of the flesh do mind; and those according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit;"
45,8,6,"for the mind of the flesh"
45,8,7,"because the mind of the flesh"
45,8,8,"for neither is it able; and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God."
45,8,9,"And you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God does dwell in you; and if any one has not the Spirit of Christ -- this one is not His;"
45,8,10,"and if Christ"
45,8,11,"and if the Spirit of Him who did raise up Jesus out of the dead does dwell in you, He who did raise up the Christ out of the dead shall quicken also your dying bodies, through His Spirit dwelling in you."
45,8,12,"So, then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh;"
45,8,13,"for if according to the flesh you do live, you are about to die; and if, by the Spirit, the deeds of the body you put to death, you shall live;"
45,8,14,"for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God;"
45,8,15,"for you did not receive a spirit of bondage again for fear, but you did receive a spirit of adoption in which we cry, 'Abba -- Father.'"
45,8,16,"The Spirit himself does testify with our spirit, that we are children of God;"
45,8,17,"and if children, also heirs, heirs, indeed, of God, and heirs together of Christ -- if, indeed, we suffer together, that we may also be glorified together."
45,8,18,"For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time"
45,8,19,"for the earnest looking out of the creation does expect the revelation of the sons of God;"
45,8,20,"for to vanity was the creation made subject -- not of its will, but because of Him who did subject"
45,8,21,"that also the creation itself shall be set free from the servitude of the corruption to the liberty of the glory of the children of God;"
45,8,22,"for we have known that all the creation does groan together, and does travail in pain together till now."
45,8,23,"And not only"
45,8,24,"for in hope we were saved, and hope beheld is not hope; for what any one does behold, why also does he hope for"
45,8,25,"and if what we do not behold we hope for, through continuance we expect"
45,8,26,"And, in like manner also, the Spirit does help our weaknesses; for, what we may pray for, as it behooves"
45,8,27,"and He who is searching the hearts has known what"
45,8,28,"And we have known that to those loving God all things do work together for good, to those who are called according to purpose;"
45,8,29,"because whom He did foreknow, He also did fore-appoint, conformed to the image of His Son, that he might be first-born among many brethren;"
45,8,30,"and whom He did fore-appoint, these also He did call; and whom He did call, these also He declared righteous; and whom He declared righteous, these also He did glorify."
45,8,31,"What, then, shall we say unto these things? if God"
45,8,32,"He who indeed His own Son did not spare, but for us all did deliver him up, how shall He not also with him the all things grant to us?"
45,8,33,"Who shall lay a charge against the choice ones of God? God"
45,8,34,"who"
45,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ? tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
45,8,36,"(according as it has been written -- 'For Your sake we are put to death all the day long, we were reckoned as sheep of slaughter,')"
45,8,37,"but in all these we more than conquer, through him who loved us;"
45,8,38,"for I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor messengers, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,"
45,8,39,"nor things about to be, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, that"
45,9,1,"Truth I say in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing testimony with me in the Holy Spirit,"
45,9,2,"that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart --"
45,9,3,"for I was wishing, I myself, to be anathema from the Christ -- for my brethren, my kindred, according to the flesh,"
45,9,4,"who are Israelites, whose"
45,9,5,"whose"
45,9,6,"And it is not possible that the word of God has failed; for not all who"
45,9,7,"nor because they are seed of Abraham"
45,9,8,"that is, the children of the flesh -- these"
45,9,9,"for the word of promise"
45,9,10,"And not only"
45,9,11,"(for they being not yet born, neither having done anything good or evil, that the purpose of God, according to choice, might remain; not of works, but of Him who is calling,) it was said to her --"
45,9,12,"'The greater shall serve the less;'"
45,9,13,"according as it has been written, 'Jacob I did love, and Esau I did hate.'"
45,9,14,"What, then, shall we say? unrighteousness"
45,9,15,"for to Moses He says, 'I will do kindness to whom I do kindness, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion;'"
45,9,16,"so, then -- not of him who is willing, nor of him who is running, but of God who is doing kindness:"
45,9,17,"for the Writing says to Pharaoh -- 'For this very thing I did raise you up, that I might show in you My power, and that My name might be declared in all the land;'"
45,9,18,"so, then, to whom He wills, He does kindness, and to whom He wills, He does harden."
45,9,19,"You will say, then, to me, 'Why yet does He find fault? for His counsel who has resisted?'"
45,9,20,"nay, but, O man, who are you that are answering again to God? shall the thing formed say to Him who did form"
45,9,21,"has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make the one vessel to honour, and the one to dishonour?"
45,9,22,"And if God, willing to show the wrath and to make known His power, did endure, in much long suffering, vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,"
45,9,23,"and that He might make known the riches of His glory on vessels of kindness, that He before prepared for glory, whom also He did call -- us --"
45,9,24,"not only out of Jews, but also out of nations,"
45,9,25,"as also in Hosea He says, 'I will call what"
45,9,26,"and it shall be -- in the place where it was said to them, You"
45,9,27,"And Isaiah does cry concerning Israel, 'If the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;"
45,9,28,"for a matter He is finishing, and is cutting short in righteousness, because a matter cut short will the Lord do upon the land."
45,9,29,"and according as Isaiah says before, 'Except the Lord of Sabaoth did leave to us a seed, as Sodom we had become, and as Gomorrah we had been made like.'"
45,9,30,"What, then, shall we say? that nations who are not pursuing righteousness did attain to righteousness, and righteousness that"
45,9,31,"and Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, at a law of righteousness did not arrive;"
45,9,32,"therefore? because -- not by faith, but as by works of law; for they did stumble at the stone of stumbling,"
45,9,33,"according as it has been written, 'Lo, I place in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence; and every one who is believing thereon shall not be ashamed.'"
45,10,1,"Brethren, the pleasure indeed of my heart, and my supplication that"
45,10,2,"for I bear them testimony that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge,"
45,10,3,"for not knowing the righteousness of God, and their own righteousness seeking to establish, to the righteousness of God they did not submit."
45,10,4,"For Christ is an end of law for righteousness to every one who is believing,"
45,10,5,"for Moses does describe the righteousness that"
45,10,6,"and the righteousness of faith does thus speak: 'You may not say in thine heart, Who shall go up to the heaven,' that is, Christ to bring down?"
45,10,7,"or, 'Who shall go down to the abyss,' that is, Christ out of the dead to bring up."
45,10,8,"But what does it say? 'Near you is the saying -- in your mouth, and in your heart:' that is, the saying of the faith, that we preach;"
45,10,9,"that if you may confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and may believe in your heart that God did raise him out of the dead, you shall be saved,"
45,10,10,"for with the heart does"
45,10,11,"for the Writing says, 'Every one who is believing on him shall not be ashamed,'"
45,10,12,"for there is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord of all"
45,10,13,"for every one -- whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be saved.'"
45,10,14,"How then shall they call upon"
45,10,15,"and how shall they preach, if they may not be sent? according as it has been written, 'How beautiful the feet of those proclaiming good tidings of peace, of those proclaiming good tidings of the good things!'"
45,10,16,"But they were not all obedient to the good tidings, for Isaiah says, 'Lord, who did give credence to our report?'"
45,10,17,"so then the faith"
45,10,18,"but I say, Did they not hear? yes, indeed -- 'to all the earth their voice went forth, and to the ends of the habitable world their sayings.'"
45,10,19,"But I say, Did not Israel know? first Moses says, 'I will provoke you to jealousy by"
45,10,20,"and Isaiah is very bold, and says, 'I was found by those not seeking Me; I became manifest to those not inquiring after Me;'"
45,10,21,"and unto Israel He says, 'All the day I did stretch out My hands unto a people unbelieving and gainsaying.'"
45,11,1,"I say, then, Did God cast away His people? let it not be! for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin:"
45,11,2,"God did not cast away His people whom He knew before; have you not known -- in Elijah -- what the Writing says? how he does plead with God concerning Israel, saying,"
45,11,3,"'Lord, Your prophets they did kill, and Your altars they dug down, and I was left alone, and they seek my life;'"
45,11,4,"but what says the divine answer to him? 'I left to Myself seven thousand men, who did not bow a knee to Baal.'"
45,11,5,"So then also in the present time a remnant according to the choice of grace there has been;"
45,11,6,"and if by grace, no more of works, otherwise the grace becomes no more grace; and if of works, it is no more grace, otherwise the work is no more work."
45,11,7,"What then? What Israel does seek after, this it did not obtain, and the chosen did obtain, and the rest were hardened,"
45,11,8,"according as it has been written, 'God gave to them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear,' -- unto this very day,"
45,11,9,"and David says, 'Let their table become for a snare, and for a trap, and for a stumbling-block, and for a recompense to them;"
45,11,10,"let their eyes be darkened -- not to behold, and their back do You always bow down.'"
45,11,11,"I say, then, Did they stumble that they might fall? let it not be! but by their fall the salvation"
45,11,12,"and if the fall of them"
45,11,13,"For to you I speak -- to the nations -- inasmuch as I am indeed an apostle of nations, my ministration I do glorify;"
45,11,14,"if by any means I shall arouse to jealousy mine own flesh, and shall save some of them,"
45,11,15,"for if the casting away of them"
45,11,16,"and if the first-fruit"
45,11,17,"And if certain of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, wast graffed in among them, and a fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree did become --"
45,11,18,"do not boast against the branches; and if you do boast, you do not bear the root, but the root you!"
45,11,19,"You will say, then, 'The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in;' right!"
45,11,20,"by unbelief they were broken off, and you have stood by faith; be not high-minded, but be fearing;"
45,11,21,"for if God the natural branches did not spare -- lest perhaps He also shall not spare you."
45,11,22,"Lo, then, goodness and severity of God -- upon those indeed who fell, severity; and upon you, goodness, if you may remain in the goodness, otherwise, you also shall be cut off."
45,11,23,"And those also, if they may not remain in unbelief, shall be graffed in, for God is able again to graff them in;"
45,11,24,"for if you, out of the olive tree, wild by nature, wast cut out, and, contrary to nature, wast graffed into a good olive tree, how much rather shall they, who"
45,11,25,"For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this secret -- that you may not be wise in your own conceits -- that hardness in part to Israel has happened till the fulness of the nations may come in;"
45,11,26,"and so all Israel shall be saved, according as it has been written, 'There shall come forth out of Sion he who is delivering, and he shall turn away impiety from Jacob,"
45,11,27,"and this to them"
45,11,28,"As regards, indeed, the good tidings,"
45,11,29,"for unrepented of"
45,11,30,"for as you also once did not believe in God, and now did find kindness by the unbelief of these:"
45,11,31,"so also these now did not believe, that in your kindness they also may find kindness;"
45,11,32,"for God did shut up together the whole to unbelief, that to the whole He might do kindness."
45,11,33,"O depth of riches, and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable His judgments, and untraceable His ways!"
45,11,34,"For who did know the mind of the Lord? or who did become His counsellor?"
45,11,35,"or who did first give to Him, and it shall be given back to him again?"
45,11,36,"because of Him, and through Him, and to Him"
45,12,1,"I call upon you, therefore, brethren, through the compassions of God, to present your bodies a sacrifice -- living, sanctified, acceptable to God -- your intelligent service;"
45,12,2,"and be not conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, for your proving what"
45,12,3,"For I say, through the grace that was given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think above what it behooves to think; but to think so as to think wisely, as to each God did deal a measure of faith,"
45,12,4,"for as in one body we have many members, and all the members have not the same office,"
45,12,5,"so we, the many, one body are in Christ, and members each one of one another."
45,12,6,"And having gifts, different according to the grace that was given to us; whether prophecy -- 'According to the proportion of faith!'"
45,12,7,"or ministration -- 'In the ministration!' or he who is teaching -- 'In the teaching!'"
45,12,8,"or he who is exhorting -- 'In the exhortation!' he who is sharing -- 'In simplicity!' he who is leading -- 'In diligence?' he who is doing kindness -- 'In cheerfulness.'"
45,12,9,"The love unfeigned: abhorring the evil; cleaving to the good;"
45,12,10,"in the love of brethren, to one another kindly affectioned: in the honour going before one another;"
45,12,11,"in the diligence not slothful; in the spirit fervent; the Lord serving;"
45,12,12,"in the hope rejoicing; in the tribulation enduring; in the prayer persevering;"
45,12,13,"to the necessities of the saints communicating; the hospitality pursuing."
45,12,14,"Bless those persecuting you; bless, and curse not;"
45,12,15,"to rejoice with the rejoicing, and to weep with the weeping,"
45,12,16,"of the same mind one toward another, not minding the high things, but with the lowly going along; become not wise in your own conceit;"
45,12,17,"giving back to no one evil for evil; providing right things before all men."
45,12,18,"If possible -- so far as in you -- with all men being in peace;"
45,12,19,"not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath, for it has been written, 'Vengeance"
45,12,20,"I will recompense again, says the Lord;' if, then, thine enemy does hunger, feed him; if he does thirst, give him drink; for this doing, coals of fire you shall heap upon his head;"
45,12,21,"Be not overcome by the evil, but overcome, in the good, the evil."
45,13,1,"Let every soul to the higher authorities be subject, for there is no authority except from God, and the authorities existing are appointed by God,"
45,13,2,"so that he who is setting himself against the authority, against God's ordinance has resisted; and those resisting, to themselves shall receive judgment."
45,13,3,"For those ruling are not a terror to the good works, but to the evil; and do you wish not to be afraid of the authority? that which is good be doing, and you shall have praise from it,"
45,13,4,"for of God it is a ministrant to you for good; and if that which is evil you may do, be fearing, for not in vain does it bear the sword; for of God it is a ministrant, an avenger for wrath to him who is doing that which is evil."
45,13,5,"Therefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because of the wrath, but also because of the conscience,"
45,13,6,"for because of this also pay you tribute; for servants of God they are, on this very thing attending continually;"
45,13,7,"render, therefore, to all"
45,13,8,"To no one owe anything, except to love one another; for he who is loving the other -- law he has fulfilled,"
45,13,9,"for, 'You shall not commit adultery, You shall do no murder, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false testimony, You shall not covet;' and if there is any other command, in this word it is summed up, in this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself;'"
45,13,10,"the love to the neighbor does work no ill; the love, therefore,"
45,13,11,"And this, knowing the time, that for us, the hour already"
45,13,12,"the night did advance, and the day came nigh; let us lay aside, therefore, the works of the darkness, and let us put on the armour of the light;"
45,13,13,"as in day-time, let us walk becomingly; not in revellings and drunkennesses, not in chamberings and lasciviousnesses, not in strife and emulation;"
45,13,14,"but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and for the flesh take no forethought -- for desires."
45,14,1,"And him who is weak in the faith receive you -- not to determinations of reasonings;"
45,14,2,"one does believe that he may eat all things -- and he who is weak does eat herbs;"
45,14,3,"let not him who is eating despise him who is not eating: and let not him who is not eating judge him who is eating, for God did receive him."
45,14,4,"You -- who are you that are judging another's domestic? to his own master he does stand or fall; and he shall be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand."
45,14,5,"One does judge one day above another, and another does judge every day"
45,14,6,"He who is regarding the day, to the Lord he does regard"
45,14,7,"For none of us to himself does live, and none to himself does die;"
45,14,8,"for both, if we may live, to the Lord we live; if also we may die, to the Lord we die; both then if we may live, also if we may die, we are the Lord's;"
45,14,9,"for because of this Christ both died and rose again, and lived again, that both of dead and of living he may be Lord."
45,14,10,"And you, why do you judge your brother? or again, you, why do you set at nought your brother? for we shall all stand at the tribunal of the Christ;"
45,14,11,"for it has been written, 'I live! says the Lord -- to Me bow shall every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God;'"
45,14,12,"so, then, each of us concerning himself shall give reckoning to God;"
45,14,13,"no longer, therefore, may we judge one another, but this judge you rather, not to put a stumbling-stone before the brother, or an offence."
45,14,14,"I have known, and am persuaded, in the Lord Jesus, that nothing"
45,14,15,"and if through victuals your brother is grieved, no more do you walk according to love; do not with your victuals destroy that one for whom Christ died."
45,14,16,"Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of,"
45,14,17,"for the reign of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit;"
45,14,18,"for he who in these things is serving the Christ,"
45,14,19,"So, then, the things of peace may we pursue, and the things of building up one another;"
45,14,20,"for the sake of victuals cast not down the work of God; all things, indeed,"
45,14,21,"Right"
45,14,22,"You have faith! To yourself have"
45,14,23,"and he who is making a difference, if he may eat, has been condemned, because"
45,15,1,"And we ought -- we who are strong -- to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves;"
45,15,2,"for let each one of us please the neighbor for good, unto edification,"
45,15,3,"for even the Christ did not please himself, but, according as it has been written, 'The reproaches of those reproaching You fell upon me;'"
45,15,4,"for, as many things as were written before, for our instruction were written before, that through the endurance, and the exhortation of the Writings, we might have the hope."
45,15,5,"And may the God of the endurance, and of the exhortation, give to you to have the same mind toward one another, according to Christ Jesus;"
45,15,6,"that with one accord -- with one mouth -- you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
45,15,7,"wherefore receive you one another, according as also the Christ did receive us, to the glory of God."
45,15,8,"And I say Jesus Christ to have become a ministrant of circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises to the fathers,"
45,15,9,"and the nations for kindness to glorify God, according as it has been written, 'Because of this I will confess to You among nations, and to Your name I will sing praise,'"
45,15,10,"and again it says, 'Rejoice you nations, with His people;'"
45,15,11,"and again, 'Praise the Lord, all you nations; and laud Him, all you peoples;'"
45,15,12,"and again, Isaiah says, 'There shall be the root of Jesse, and he who is rising to rule nations -- upon him shall nations hope;'"
45,15,13,"and the God of the hope shall fill you with all joy and peace in the believing, for your abounding in the hope in power of the Holy Spirit."
45,15,14,"And I am persuaded, my brethren -- I myself also -- concerning you, that you yourselves also are full of goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, able also one another to admonish;"
45,15,15,"and the more boldly I did write to you, brethren, in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me by God,"
45,15,16,"for my being a servant of Jesus Christ to the nations, acting as priest in the good news of God, that the offering up of the nations may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
45,15,17,"I have, then, a boasting in Christ Jesus, in the things pertaining to God,"
45,15,18,"for I will not dare to speak anything of the things that Christ did not work through me, to obedience of nations, by word and deed,"
45,15,19,"in power of signs and wonders, in power of the Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circle as far as Illyricum, have fully preached the good news of the Christ;"
45,15,20,"and so counting it honour to proclaim good news, not where Christ was named -- that upon another's foundation I might not build --"
45,15,21,"but according as it has been written, 'To whom it was not told concerning him, they shall see; and they who have not heard, shall understand.'"
45,15,22,"Therefore, also, I was hindered many times from coming unto you,"
45,15,23,"and now, no longer having place in these parts, and having a longing to come unto you for many years,"
45,15,24,"when I may go on to Spain I will come unto you, for I hope in going through, to see you, and by you to be set forward thither, if of you first, in part, I shall be filled."
45,15,25,"And, now, I go on to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints;"
45,15,26,"for it pleased Macedonia and Achaia well to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who"
45,15,27,"for it pleased well, and their debtors they are, for if in their spiritual things the nations did participate, they ought also, in the fleshly things, to minister to them."
45,15,28,"This, then, having finished, and having sealed to them this fruit, I will return through you, to Spain;"
45,15,29,"and I have known that coming unto you -- in the fulness of the blessing of the good news of Christ I shall come."
45,15,30,"And I call upon you, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in the prayers for me unto God,"
45,15,31,"that I may be delivered from those not believing in Judea, and that my ministration, that"
45,15,32,"that in joy I may come unto you, through the will of God, and may be refreshed with you,"
45,15,33,"and the God of the peace"
45,16,1,"And I commend you to Phebe our sister -- being a ministrant of the assembly that"
45,16,2,"that you may receive her in the Lord, as does become saints, and may assist her in whatever matter she may have need of you -- for she also became a leader of many, and of myself."
45,16,3,"Salute Priscilla and Aquilas, my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus --"
45,16,4,"who for my life their own neck did lay down, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the nations --"
45,16,5,"and the assembly at their house; salute Epaenetus, my beloved, who is first-fruit of Achaia to Christ."
45,16,6,"Salute Mary, who did labour much for us;"
45,16,7,"salute Andronicus and Junias, my kindred, and my fellow-captives, who are of note among the apostles, who also have been in Christ before me."
45,16,8,"Salute Amplias, my beloved in the Lord;"
45,16,9,"salute Arbanus, our fellow-workman in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved;"
45,16,10,"salute Apelles, the approved in Christ; salute those of the"
45,16,11,"salute Herodion, my kinsman; salute those of the"
45,16,12,"salute Tryphaena, and Tryphosa, who are labouring in the Lord; salute Persis, the beloved, who did labour much in the Lord."
45,16,13,"Salute Rufus, the choice one in the Lord, and his mother and mine,"
45,16,14,"salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren with them;"
45,16,15,"salute Philologus, and Julias, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them;"
45,16,16,"salute one another in a holy kiss; the assemblies of Christ do salute you."
45,16,17,"And I call upon you, brethren, to mark those who the divisions and the stumbling-blocks, contrary to the teaching that you did learn, are causing, and turn you away from them;"
45,16,18,"for such our Lord Jesus Christ do not serve, but their own belly; and through the good word and fair speech they deceive the hearts of the harmless,"
45,16,19,"for your obedience did reach to all; I rejoice, therefore, as regards you, and I wish you to be wise, indeed, as to the good, and harmless as to the evil;"
45,16,20,"and the God of the peace shall bruise the Adversary under your feet quickly; the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ"
45,16,21,"Salute you do Timotheus, my fellow-workman, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kindred;"
45,16,22,"I Tertius salute you (who wrote the letter) in the Lord;"
45,16,23,"salute you does Gaius, my host, and of the whole assembly; salute you does Erastus, the steward of the city, and Quartus the brother,"
45,16,24,"the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ"
45,16,25,"And to Him who is able to establish you, according to my good news, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the secret, in the times of the ages having been kept silent,"
45,16,26,"and now having been made manifest, also, through prophetic writings, according to a command of the age-during God, having been made known to all the nations for obedience of faith --"
45,16,27,"to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to him"
46,1,1,"Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,"
46,1,2,"to the assembly of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place -- both theirs and ours:"
46,1,3,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
46,1,4,"I give thanks to my God always concerning you for the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus,"
46,1,5,"that in every thing you were enriched in him, in all discourse and all knowledge,"
46,1,6,"according as the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in you,"
46,1,7,"so that you are not behind in any gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
46,1,8,"who also shall confirm you unto the end -- unblameable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
46,1,9,"faithful"
46,1,10,"And I call upon you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that the same thing you may all say, and there may not be divisions among you, and you may be perfected in the same mind, and in the same judgment,"
46,1,11,"for it was signified to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloe, that contentions are among you;"
46,1,12,"and I say this, that each one of you says, 'I, indeed, am of Paul' -- 'and I of Apollos,' -- 'and I of Cephas,' -- 'and I of Christ.'"
46,1,13,"Has the Christ been divided? was Paul crucified for you? or to the name of Paul were you baptized;"
46,1,14,"I give thanks to God that no one of you did I baptize, except Crispus and Gaius --"
46,1,15,"that no one may say that to my own name I did baptize;"
46,1,16,"and I did baptize also Stephanas' household -- further, I have not known if I did baptize any other."
46,1,17,"For Christ did not send me to baptize, but -- to proclaim good news; not in wisdom of discourse, that the cross of the Christ may not be made of none effect;"
46,1,18,"for the word of the cross to those indeed perishing is foolishness, and to us -- those being saved -- it is the power of God,"
46,1,19,"for it has been written, 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will bring to nothing;'"
46,1,20,"where"
46,1,21,"for, seeing in the wisdom of God the world through the wisdom knew not God, it did please God through the foolishness of the preaching to save those believing."
46,1,22,"Since also Jews ask a sign, and Greeks seek wisdom,"
46,1,23,"also we -- we preach Christ crucified, to Jews, indeed, a stumbling-block, and to Greeks foolishness,"
46,1,24,"and to those called -- both Jews and Greeks -- Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God,"
46,1,25,"because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men;"
46,1,26,"for see your calling, brethren, that not many"
46,1,27,"but the foolish things of the world did God choose, that the wise He may put to shame; and the weak things of the world did God choose that He may put to shame the strong;"
46,1,28,"and the base things of the world, and the things despised did God choose, and the things that are not, that the things that are He may make useless --"
46,1,29,"that no flesh may glory before Him;"
46,1,30,"and of Him you -- you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us from God wisdom, righteousness also, and sanctification, and redemption,"
46,1,31,"that, according as it has been written, 'He who is glorying -- in the Lord let him glory.'"
46,2,1,"And I, having come unto you, brethren, came -- not in superiority of discourse or wisdom -- declaring to you the testimony of God,"
46,2,2,"for I decided not to know any thing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified;"
46,2,3,"and I, in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling, was with you;"
46,2,4,"and my word and my preaching was not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power --"
46,2,5,"that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
46,2,6,"And wisdom we speak among the perfect, and wisdom not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age -- of those becoming useless,"
46,2,7,"but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a secret, that God foreordained before the ages to our glory,"
46,2,8,"which no one of the rulers of this age did know, for if they had known, the Lord of the glory they would not have crucified;"
46,2,9,"but, according as it has been written, 'What eye did not see, and ear did not hear, and upon the heart of man came not up, what God did prepare for those loving Him --'"
46,2,10,"but to us did God reveal"
46,2,11,"for who of men have known the things of the man, except the spirit of the man that"
46,2,12,"And we the spirit of the world did not receive, but the Spirit that"
46,2,13,"which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, with spiritual things spiritual things comparing,"
46,2,14,"and the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for to him they are foolishness, and he is not able to know"
46,2,15,"and he who is spiritual, does discern indeed all things, and he himself is by no one discerned;"
46,2,16,"for who did know the mind of the Lord that he shall instruct Him? and we -- we have the mind of Christ."
46,3,1,"And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly -- as to babes in Christ;"
46,3,2,"with milk I fed you, and not with meat, for you were not yet able, but not even yet are you now able,"
46,3,3,"for yet you are fleshly, for where"
46,3,4,"for when one may say, 'I, indeed, am of Paul;' and another, 'I -- of Apollos;' are you not fleshly?"
46,3,5,"Who, then, is Paul, and who Apollos, but ministrants through whom you did believe, and to each as the Lord gave?"
46,3,6,"I planted, Apollos watered, but God was giving growth;"
46,3,7,"so that neither is he who is planting anything, nor he who is watering, but He who is giving growth -- God;"
46,3,8,"and he who is planting and he who is watering are one, and each his own reward shall receive, according to his own labour,"
46,3,9,"for of God we are fellow-workmen; God's tillage, God's building you are."
46,3,10,"According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a wise master-builder, a foundation I have laid, and another does build on"
46,3,11,"for other foundation no one is able to lay except that which is laid, which is Jesus the Christ;"
46,3,12,"and if any one does build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw --"
46,3,13,"of each the work shall become manifest, for the day shall declare"
46,3,14,"if of any one the work does remain that he built on"
46,3,15,"if of any the work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; and himself shall be saved, but so as through fire."
46,3,16,"have you not known that you are a sanctuary of God, and the Spirit of God does dwell in you?"
46,3,17,"if any one the sanctuary of God does waste, him shall God waste; for the sanctuary of God is holy, the which you are."
46,3,18,"Let no one deceive himself; if any one does seem to be wise among you in this age -- let him become a fool, that he may become wise,"
46,3,19,"for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it has been written, 'Who is taking the wise in their craftiness;'"
46,3,20,"and again, 'The Lord does know the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.'"
46,3,21,"So then, let no one glory in men, for all things are yours,"
46,3,22,"whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things about to be -- all are yours,"
46,3,23,"and you"
46,4,1,"Let a man so reckon us as officers of Christ, and stewards of the secrets of God,"
46,4,2,"and as to the rest, it is required in the stewards that one may be found faithful,"
46,4,3,"and to me it is for a very little thing that by you I may be judged, or by man's day, but not even myself do I judge,"
46,4,4,"for of nothing to myself have I been conscious, but not in this have I been declared right -- and he who is discerning me is the Lord:"
46,4,5,"so, then, nothing before the time judge you, till the Lord may come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of the darkness, and will manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then the praise shall come to each from God."
46,4,6,"And these things, brethren, I did transfer to myself and to Apollos because of you, that in us you may learn not to think above that which has been written, that you may not be puffed up one for one against the other,"
46,4,7,"for who does make you to differ? and what have you, that you did not receive? and if you did also receive, why do you glory as not having received?"
46,4,8,"Already you are having been filled, already you were rich, apart from us you did reign, and I would also you did reign, that we also with you may reign together,"
46,4,9,"for I think that God did set forth us the apostles last -- as appointed to death, because a spectacle we became to the world, and messengers, and men;"
46,4,10,"we"
46,4,11,"unto the present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and wander about,"
46,4,12,"and labour, working with"
46,4,13,"being spoken evil of, we entreat; as filth of the world we did become -- of all things an offscouring -- till now."
46,4,14,"Not"
46,4,15,"for if a myriad of child-conductors you may have in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus, through the good news, I -- I did beget you;"
46,4,16,"I call upon you, therefore, become you followers of me;"
46,4,17,"because of this I sent to you Timotheus, who is my child, beloved and faithful in the Lord, who shall remind you of my ways in Christ, according as everywhere in every assembly I teach."
46,4,18,"And as if I were not coming unto you certain were puffed up;"
46,4,19,"but I will come quickly unto you, if the Lord may will, and I will know not the word of those puffed up, but the power;"
46,4,20,"for not in word is the reign of God, but in power?"
46,4,21,"what do you wish? with a rod shall I come unto you, or in love, with a spirit also of meekness?"
46,5,1,"Whoredom is actually heard of among you, and such whoredom as is not even named among the nations -- as that one has the wife of the father! --"
46,5,2,"and you are having been puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he may be removed out of the midst of you who did this work,"
46,5,3,"for I indeed, as being absent as to the body, and present as to the spirit, have already judged, as being present, him who so wrought this thing:"
46,5,4,"in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ -- you being gathered together, also my spirit -- with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
46,5,5,"to deliver up such a one to the Adversary for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
46,5,6,"Not good"
46,5,7,"cleanse out, therefore, the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, according as you are unleavened, for also our passover for us was sacrificed -- Christ,"
46,5,8,"so that we may keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness, but with unleavened food of sincerity and truth."
46,5,9,"I did write to you in the epistle, not to keep company with whoremongers --"
46,5,10,"and not certainly with the whoremongers of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, seeing you ought then to go forth out of the world --"
46,5,11,"and now, I did write to you not to keep company with"
46,5,12,"for what have I also those without to judge? those within do you not judge?"
46,5,13,"and those without God does judge; and put you away the evil from among yourselves."
46,6,1,"Dare any one of you, having a matter with the other, go to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?"
46,6,2,"have you not known that the saints shall judge the world? and if by you the world is judged, are you unworthy of the smaller judgments?"
46,6,3,"have you not known that we shall judge messengers? why not then the things of life?"
46,6,4,"of the things of life, indeed, then, if you may have judgment, those despised in the assembly -- these cause you to sit;"
46,6,5,"unto your shame I speak: so there is not among you one wise man, not even one, who shall be able to discern in the midst of his brethren!"
46,6,6,"but brother with brother does go to be judged, and this before unbelievers!"
46,6,7,"Already, indeed, then, there is altogether a fault among you, that you have judgments with one another; wherefore do you not rather suffer injustice? wherefore be you not rather defrauded?"
46,6,8,"but you -- you do injustice, and you defraud, and these -- brethren!"
46,6,9,"have you not known that the unrighteous the reign of God shall not inherit? be not led astray; neither whoremongers, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,"
46,6,10,"nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, the reign of God shall inherit."
46,6,11,"And certain of you were these! but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were declared righteous, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God."
46,6,12,"All things are lawful to me, but all things are not profitable; all things are lawful to me, but I -- I will not be under authority by any;"
46,6,13,"the meats"
46,6,14,"and God both the Lord did raise, and us will raise up through His power."
46,6,15,"Have you not known that your bodies are members of Christ? having taken, then, the members of the Christ, shall I make"
46,6,16,"have you not known that he who is joined to the harlot is one body? 'for they shall be -- says He -- the two for one flesh.'"
46,6,17,"And he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit;"
46,6,18,"flee the whoredom; every sin -- whatever a man may commit -- is without the body, and he who is committing whoredom, against his own body does sin."
46,6,19,"Have you not known that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit in you, which you have from God? and you are not your own,"
46,6,20,"for you were bought with a price; glorify, then, God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's."
46,7,1,"And concerning the things of which you wrote to me: good"
46,7,2,"and because of the whoredom let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her proper husband;"
46,7,3,"to the wife let the husband the due benevolence render, and in like manner also the wife to the husband;"
46,7,4,"the wife over her own body has not authority, but the husband; and, in like manner also, the husband over his own body has not authority, but the wife."
46,7,5,"Defraud not one another, except by consent for a time, that you may be free for fasting and prayer, and again may come together, that the Adversary may not tempt you because of your incontinence;"
46,7,6,"and this I say by way of concurrence -- not of command,"
46,7,7,"for I wish all men to be even as I myself"
46,7,8,"And I say to the unmarried and to the widows: it is good for them if they may remain even as I"
46,7,9,"and if they have not continence -- let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn;"
46,7,10,"and to the married I announce -- not I, but the Lord -- let not a wife separate from a husband:"
46,7,11,"but and if she may separate, let her remain unmarried, or to the husband let her be reconciled, and let not a husband send away a wife."
46,7,12,"And to the rest I speak -- not the Lord -- if any brother has a wife unbelieving, and she is pleased to dwell with him, let him not send her away;"
46,7,13,"and a woman who has a husband unbelieving, and he is pleased to dwell with her, let her not send him away;"
46,7,14,"for the unbelieving husband has been sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified in the husband; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy."
46,7,15,"And, if the unbelieving does separate himself -- let him separate himself: the brother or the sister is not under servitude in such"
46,7,16,"for what, have you known, O wife, whether the husband you shalt save? or what, have you known, O husband, whether the wife you shalt save?"
46,7,17,"if not, as God did distribute to each, as the Lord has called each -- so let him walk; and thus in all the assemblies do I direct:"
46,7,18,"being circumcised -- was any one called? let him not become uncircumcised; in uncircumcision was any one called? let him not be circumcised;"
46,7,19,"the circumcision is nothing, and the uncircumcision is nothing -- but a keeping of the commands of God."
46,7,20,"Each in the calling in which he was called -- in this let him remain;"
46,7,21,"a servant -- wast you called? be not anxious; but if also you are able to become free -- use"
46,7,22,"for he who"
46,7,23,"with a price you were bought, become not servants of men;"
46,7,24,"each, in that in which he was called, brethren, in this let him remain with God."
46,7,25,"And concerning the virgins, a command of the Lord I have not; and I give judgment as having obtained kindness from the Lord to be faithful:"
46,7,26,"I suppose, therefore, this to be good because of the present necessity, that"
46,7,27,"Have you been bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed; have you been loosed from a wife? seek not a wife."
46,7,28,"But and if you may marry, you did not sin; and if the virgin may marry, she did not sin; and such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I spare you."
46,7,29,"And this I say, brethren, the time henceforth is having been shortened -- that both those having wives may be as not having;"
46,7,30,"and those weeping, as not weeping; and those rejoicing, as not rejoicing; and those buying, as not possessing;"
46,7,31,"and those using this world, as not using"
46,7,32,"And I wish you to be without anxiety; the unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord;"
46,7,33,"and the married is anxious for the things of the world, how he shall please the wife."
46,7,34,"The wife and the virgin have been distinguished: the unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit, and the married is anxious for the things of the world, how she shall please the husband."
46,7,35,"And this for your own profit I say: not that I may cast a noose upon you, but for the seemliness and devotedness to the Lord, undistractedly,"
46,7,36,"and if any one does think"
46,7,37,"And he who has stood stedfast in the heart -- not having necessity -- and has authority over his own will, and this he has determined in his heart -- to keep his own virgin -- does well;"
46,7,38,"so that both he who is giving in marriage does well, and he who is not giving in marriage does better."
46,7,39,"A wife has been bound by law as long time as her husband may live, and if her husband may sleep, she is free to be married to whom she will -- only in the Lord;"
46,7,40,"and she is happier if she may so remain -- according to my judgment; and I think I also have the Spirit of God."
46,8,1,"And concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that we all have knowledge: knowledge puffs up, but love builds up;"
46,8,2,"and if any one does think to know anything, he has not yet known anything according as it behooves"
46,8,3,"and if any one does love God, this one has been known by Him."
46,8,4,"Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that an idol"
46,8,5,"for even if there are those called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon earth -- as there are gods many and lords many --"
46,8,6,"yet to us"
46,8,7,"but not in all men"
46,8,8,"But victuals do not commend us to God, for neither if we may eat are we in advance; nor if we may not eat, are we behind;"
46,8,9,"but see, lest this privilege of yours may become a stumbling-block to the infirm,"
46,8,10,"for if any one may see you that has knowledge in an idol's temple reclining at meat -- shall not his conscience -- he being infirm -- be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to idols,"
46,8,11,"and the brother who is infirm shall perish by thy knowledge, because of whom Christ died?"
46,8,12,"and thus sinning in regard to the brethren, and smiting their weak conscience -- in regard to Christ you sin;"
46,8,13,"wherefore, if victuals cause my brother to stumble, I may eat no flesh -- to the age -- that my brother I may not cause to stumble."
46,9,1,"Am not I an apostle? am not I free? Jesus Christ our Lord have I not seen? my work are not you in the Lord?"
46,9,2,"if to others I am not an apostle -- yet doubtless to you I am; for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord."
46,9,3,"My defence to those who examine me in this;"
46,9,4,"have we not authority to eat and to drink?"
46,9,5,"have we not authority a sister -- a wife -- to lead about, as also the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?"
46,9,6,"or only I and Barnabas, have we not authority -- not to work?"
46,9,7,"who does serve as a soldier at his own charges at any time? who does plant a vineyard, and of its fruit does not eat? or who does feed a flock, and of the milk of the flock does not eat?"
46,9,8,"According to man do I speak these things? or does not also the law say these things?"
46,9,9,"for in the law of Moses it has been written, 'you shalt not muzzle an ox treading out corn;' for the oxen does God care?"
46,9,10,"or because of us by all means does He say"
46,9,11,"If we to you the spiritual things did sow -- great"
46,9,12,"if others do partake of the authority over you -- not we more? but we did not use this authority, but all things we bear, that we may give no hindrance to the good news of the Christ."
46,9,13,"Have you not known that those working about the things of the temple -- of the temple do eat, and those waiting at the altar -- with the altar are partakers?"
46,9,14,"so also did the Lord direct to those proclaiming the good news: of the good news to live."
46,9,15,"And I have used none of these things; neither did I write these things that it may be so done in my case, for"
46,9,16,"for if I may proclaim good news, it is no glorying for me, for necessity is laid upon me, and woe is to me if I may not proclaim good news;"
46,9,17,"for if willing I do this, I have a reward; and if unwillingly -- with a stewardship I have been entrusted!"
46,9,18,"What, then, is my reward? -- that proclaiming good news, without charge I shall make the good news of the Christ, not to abuse my authority in the good news;"
46,9,19,"for being free from all men, to all men I made myself servant, that the more I might gain;"
46,9,20,"and I became to the Jews as a Jew, that Jews I might gain; to those under law as under law, that those under law I might gain;"
46,9,21,"to those without law, as without law -- (not being without law to God, but within law to Christ) -- that I might gain those without law;"
46,9,22,"I became to the infirm as infirm, that the infirm I might gain; to all men I have become all things, that by all means I may save some."
46,9,23,"And this I do because of the good news, that a fellow-partaker of it I may become;"
46,9,24,"have you not known that those running in a race -- all indeed run, but one does receive the prize? so run you, that you may obtain;"
46,9,25,"and every one who is striving, is in all things temperate; these, indeed, then, that a corruptible crown they may receive, but we an incorruptible;"
46,9,26,"I, therefore, thus run, not as uncertainly, thus I fight, as not beating air;"
46,9,27,"but I chastise my body, and bring"
46,10,1,"And I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea,"
46,10,2,"and all to Moses were baptized in the cloud, and in the sea;"
46,10,3,"and all the same spiritual food did eat,"
46,10,4,"and all the same spiritual drink did drink, for they were drinking of a spiritual rock following them, and the rock was the Christ;"
46,10,5,"but in the most of them God was not well pleased, for they were strewn in the wilderness,"
46,10,6,"and those things became types of us, for our not passionately desiring evil things, as also these did desire."
46,10,7,"Neither become you idolaters, as certain of them, as it has been written, 'The people sat down to eat and to drink, and stood up to play;'"
46,10,8,"neither may we commit whoredom, as certain of them did commit whoredom, and there fell in one day twenty-three thousand;"
46,10,9,"neither may we tempt the Christ, as also certain of them did tempt, and by the serpents did perish;"
46,10,10,"neither murmur you, as also some of them did murmur, and did perish by the destroyer."
46,10,11,"And all these things as types did happen to those persons, and they were written for our admonition, to whom the end of the ages did come,"
46,10,12,"so that he who is thinking to stand -- let him observe, lest he fall."
46,10,13,"No temptation has taken you -- except human; and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you are able, but He will make, with the temptation, also the outlet, for your being able to bear"
46,10,14,"Wherefore, my beloved, flee from the idolatry;"
46,10,15,"as to wise men I speak -- judge you what I say:"
46,10,16,"The cup of the blessing that we bless -- is it not the fellowship of the blood of the Christ? the bread that we break -- is it not the fellowship of the body of the Christ?"
46,10,17,"because one bread, one body, are we the many -- for we all of the one bread do partake."
46,10,18,"See Israel according to the flesh! are not those eating the sacrifices in the fellowship of the altar?"
46,10,19,"what then do I say? that an idol is anything? or that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything? --"
46,10,20,""
46,10,21,"you are not able the cup of the Lord to drink, and the cup of demons; you are not able of the table of the Lord to partake, and of the table of demons;"
46,10,22,"do we arouse the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than He?"
46,10,23,"All things to me are lawful, but all things are not profitable; all things to me are lawful, but all things do not build up;"
46,10,24,"let no one seek his own -- but each another's."
46,10,25,"Whatever in the meat-market is sold eat you, not inquiring, because of the conscience,"
46,10,26,"for the Lord's"
46,10,27,"and if any one of the unbelieving do call you, and you wish to go, all that is set before you eat, nothing inquiring, because of the conscience;"
46,10,28,"and if any one may say to you, 'This is a thing sacrificed to an idol,' -- do not eat, because of that one who showed"
46,10,29,"and conscience, I say, not of thyself, but of the other, for why"
46,10,30,"and if I thankfully do partake, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks?"
46,10,31,"Whether, then, you eat, or drink, or do anything, do all to the glory of God;"
46,10,32,"become offenceless, both to Jews and Greeks, and to the assembly of God;"
46,10,33,"as I also in all things do please all, not seeking my own profit, but that of many -- that they may be saved."
46,11,1,"Followers of me become you, as I also"
46,11,2,"And I praise you, brethren, that in all things you remember me, and according as I did deliver to you, the deliverances you keep,"
46,11,3,"and I wish you to know that of every man the head is the Christ, and the head of a woman is the husband, and the head of Christ is God."
46,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having the head covered, does dishonour his head,"
46,11,5,"and every woman praying or prophesying with the head uncovered, does dishonour her own head, for it is one and the same thing with her being shaven,"
46,11,6,"for if a woman is not covered -- then let her be shorn, and if"
46,11,7,"for a man, indeed, ought not to cover the head, being the image and glory of God, and a woman is the glory of a man,"
46,11,8,"for a man is not of a woman, but a woman"
46,11,9,"for a man also was not created because of the woman, but a woman because of the man;"
46,11,10,"because of this the woman ought to have"
46,11,11,"but neither"
46,11,12,"for as the woman"
46,11,13,"In your own selves judge you; is it seemly for a woman uncovered to pray to God?"
46,11,14,"does not even nature itself teach you, that if a man indeed have long hair, a dishonour it is to him?"
46,11,15,"and a woman, if she have long hair, a glory it is to her, because the hair instead of a covering has been given to her;"
46,11,16,"and if any one does think to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the assemblies of God."
46,11,17,"And this declaring, I give no praise, because not for the better, but for the worse you come together;"
46,11,18,"for first, indeed, you coming together in an assembly, I hear of divisions being among you, and partly I believe"
46,11,19,"for it behooves sects also to be among you, that those approved may become manifest among you;"
46,11,20,"you, then, coming together at the same place -- it is not to eat the Lord's supper;"
46,11,21,"for each his own supper does take before in the eating, and one is hungry, and another is drunk;"
46,11,22,"why, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? or the assembly of God do you despise, and shame those not having? what may I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I do not praise!"
46,11,23,"For I -- I received from the Lord that which also I did deliver to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread,"
46,11,24,"and having given thanks, he brake, and said,"
46,11,25,"In like manner also the cup after the supping, saying,"
46,11,26,"for as often as you may eat this bread, and this cup may drink, the death of the Lord you do show forth -- till he may come;"
46,11,27,"so that whoever may eat this bread or may drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, guilty he shall be of the body and blood of the Lord:"
46,11,28,"and let a man be proving himself, and so of the bread let him eat, and of the cup let him drink;"
46,11,29,"for he who is eating and drinking unworthily, judgment to himself he does eat and drink -- not discerning the body of the Lord."
46,11,30,"Because of this, among you many"
46,11,31,"for if ourselves we were discerning, we would not be being judged,"
46,11,32,"and being judged by the Lord, we are chastened, that with the world we may not be condemned;"
46,11,33,"so then, my brethren, coming together to eat, for one another wait you;"
46,11,34,"and if any one is hungry, at home let him eat, that to judgment you may not come together; and the rest, whenever I may come, I shall arrange."
46,12,1,"And concerning the spiritual things, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant;"
46,12,2,"you have known that you were nations, unto the dumb idols -- as you were led -- being carried away;"
46,12,3,"wherefore, I give you to understand that no one, in the Spirit of God speaking, says Jesus"
46,12,4,"And there are diversities of gifts, and the same Spirit;"
46,12,5,"and there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord;"
46,12,6,"and there are diversities of workings, and it is the same God -- who is working the all in all."
46,12,7,"And to each has been given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit;"
46,12,8,"for to one through the Spirit has been given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;"
46,12,9,"and to another faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healings in the same Spirit;"
46,12,10,"and to another in-workings of mighty deeds; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; and to another"
46,12,11,"and all these does work the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each severally as he intends."
46,12,12,"For, even as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the one body, being many, are one body, so also"
46,12,13,"for also in one Spirit we all to one body were baptized, whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or freemen, and all into one Spirit were made to drink,"
46,12,14,"for also the body is not one member, but many;"
46,12,15,"if the foot may say, 'Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body;' it is not, because of this, not of the body;"
46,12,16,"and if the ear may say, 'Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body;' it is not, because of this, not of the body?"
46,12,17,"If the whole body"
46,12,18,"and now, God did set the members each one of them in the body, according as He willed,"
46,12,19,"and if all were one member, where the body?"
46,12,20,"and now, indeed,"
46,12,21,"and an eye is not able to say to the hand, 'I have no need of you;' nor again the head to the feet, 'I have no need of you.'"
46,12,22,"But much more the members of the body which seem to be more infirm are necessary,"
46,12,23,"and those that we think to be less honourable of the body, around these we put more abundant honour, and our unseemly things have seemliness more abundant,"
46,12,24,"and our seemly things have no need; but God did temper the body together, to the lacking part having given more abundant honour,"
46,12,25,"that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same anxiety for one another,"
46,12,26,"and whether one member does suffer, suffer with"
46,12,27,"and you are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
46,12,28,"And some, indeed, did God set in the assembly, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, afterwards powers, afterwards gifts of healings, helpings, governings, divers kinds of tongues;"
46,12,29,""
46,12,30,"have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?"
46,12,31,"and desire earnestly the better gifts; and yet a far excelling way do I show to you:"
46,13,1,"If with the tongues of men and of messengers I speak, and have not love, I have become brass sounding, or a cymbal tinkling;"
46,13,2,"and if I have prophecy, and know all the secrets, and all the knowledge, and if I have all the faith, so as to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing;"
46,13,3,"and if I give away to feed others all my goods, and if I give up my body that I may be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing."
46,13,4,"The love is long-suffering, it is kind, the love does not envy, the love does not vaunt itself, is not puffed up,"
46,13,5,"does not act unseemly, does not seek its own things, is not provoked, does not impute evil,"
46,13,6,"rejoices not over the unrighteousness, and rejoices with the truth;"
46,13,7,"all things it bears, all it believes, all it hopes, all it endures."
46,13,8,"The love does never fail; and whether"
46,13,9,"for in part we know, and in part we prophecy;"
46,13,10,"and when that which is perfect may come, then that which"
46,13,11,"When I was a babe, as a babe I was speaking, as a babe I was thinking, as a babe I was reasoning, and when I have become a man, I have made useless the things of the babe;"
46,13,12,"for we see now through a mirror obscurely, and then face to face; now I know in part, and then I shall fully know, as also I was known;"
46,13,13,"and now there does remain faith, hope, love -- these three; and the greatest of these"
46,14,1,"Pursue the love, and seek earnestly the spiritual things, and rather that you may prophecy,"
46,14,2,"for he who is speaking in an"
46,14,3,"and he who is prophesying to men does speak edification, and exhortation, and comfort;"
46,14,4,"he who is speaking in an"
46,14,5,"and I wish you all to speak with tongues, and more that you may prophecy, for greater is he who is prophesying than he who is speaking with tongues, except one may interpret, that the assembly may receive edification."
46,14,6,"And now, brethren, if I may come unto you speaking tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophesying, or in teaching?"
46,14,7,"yet the things without life giving sound -- whether pipe or harp -- if a difference in the sounds they may not give, how shall be known that which is piped or that which is harped?"
46,14,8,"for if also an uncertain sound a trumpet may give, who shall prepare himself for battle?"
46,14,9,"so also you, if through the tongue, speech easily understood you may not give -- how shall that which is spoken be known? for you shall be speaking to air."
46,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is unmeaning,"
46,14,11,"if, then, I do not know the power of the voice, I shall be to him who is speaking a foreigner, and he who is speaking, is to me a foreigner;"
46,14,12,"so also you, since you are earnestly desirous of spiritual gifts, for the building up of the assembly seek that you may abound;"
46,14,13,"wherefore he who is speaking in an"
46,14,14,"for if I pray in an"
46,14,15,"What then is it? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing psalms with the spirit, and I will sing psalms also with the understanding;"
46,14,16,"since, if you may bless with the spirit, he who is filling the place of the unlearned, how shall he say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, since what you do say he has not known?"
46,14,17,"for you, indeed, do give thanks well, but the other is not built up!"
46,14,18,"I give thanks to my God -- more than you all with tongues speaking --"
46,14,19,"but in an assembly I wish to speak five words through my understanding, that others also I may instruct, rather than myriads of words in an"
46,14,20,"Brethren, become not children in the understanding, but in the evil be you babes, and in the understanding become you perfect;"
46,14,21,"in the law it has been written, that, 'With other tongues and with other lips I will speak to this people, and not even so will they hear Me, says the Lord;'"
46,14,22,"so that the tongues are for a sign, not to the believing, but to the unbelieving; and the prophesy"
46,14,23,"If, therefore, the whole assembly may come together, to the same place, and all may speak with tongues, and there may come in unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?"
46,14,24,"and if all may prophecy, and any one may come in, an unbeliever or unlearned, he is convicted by all, he is discerned by all,"
46,14,25,"and so the secrets of his heart become manifest, and so having fallen upon"
46,14,26,"What then is it, brethren? whenever you may come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation? let all things be for building up;"
46,14,27,"if an"
46,14,28,"and if there may be no interpreter, let him be silent in an assembly, and to himself let him speak, and to God."
46,14,29,"And prophets -- let two or three speak, and let the others discern,"
46,14,30,"and if to another sitting"
46,14,31,"for you are able, one by one, all to prophesy, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted,"
46,14,32,"and the spiritual gift of prophets to prophets are subject,"
46,14,33,"for God is not"
46,14,34,"Your women in the assemblies let them be silent, for it has not been permitted to them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law says;"
46,14,35,"and if they wish to learn anything, at home their own husbands let them question, for it is a shame to women to speak in an assembly."
46,14,36,"From you did the word of God come forth? or to you alone did it come?"
46,14,37,"if any one does think to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge the things that I write to you -- that of the Lord they are commands;"
46,14,38,"and if any one is ignorant -- let him be ignorant;"
46,14,39,"so that, brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and to speak with tongues do not forbid;"
46,14,40,"let all things be done decently and in order."
46,15,1,"And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that I proclaimed to you, which also you did receive, in which also you have stood,"
46,15,2,"through which also you are being saved, in what words I proclaimed good news to you, if you hold fast, except you did believe in vain,"
46,15,3,"for I delivered to you first, what also I did receive, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Writings,"
46,15,4,"and that he was buried, and that he has risen on the third day, according to the Writings,"
46,15,5,"and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve,"
46,15,6,"afterwards he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain till now, and certain also did fall asleep;"
46,15,7,"afterwards he appeared to James, then to all the apostles."
46,15,8,"And last of all -- as to the untimely birth -- he appeared also to me,"
46,15,9,"for I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I did persecute the assembly of God,"
46,15,10,"and by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace that"
46,15,11,"whether, then, I or they, so we preach, and so you did believe."
46,15,12,"And if Christ is preached, that out of the dead he has risen, how say certain among you, that there is no rising again of dead persons?"
46,15,13,"and if there be no rising again of dead persons, neither has Christ risen;"
46,15,14,"and if Christ has not risen, then void"
46,15,15,"and we also are found false witnesses of God, because we did testify of God that He raised up the Christ, whom He did not raise if then dead persons do not rise;"
46,15,16,"for if dead persons do not rise, neither has Christ risen,"
46,15,17,"and if Christ has not risen, vain is your faith, you are yet in your sins;"
46,15,18,"then, also, those having fallen asleep in Christ did perish;"
46,15,19,"if in this life we have hope in Christ only, of all men we are most to be pitied."
46,15,20,"And now, Christ has risen out of the dead -- the first-fruits of those sleeping he became,"
46,15,21,"for since through man"
46,15,22,"for even as in Adam all die, so also in the Christ all shall be made alive,"
46,15,23,"and each in his proper order, a first-fruit Christ, afterwards those who are the Christ's, in his presence,"
46,15,24,"then -- the end, when he may deliver up the reign to God, even the Father, when he may have made useless all rule, and all authority and power --"
46,15,25,"for it behooves him to reign till he may have put all the enemies under his feet --"
46,15,26,"the last enemy is done away -- death;"
46,15,27,"for all things He did put under his feet, and, when one may say that all things have been subjected,"
46,15,28,"and when the all things may be subjected to him, then the Son also himself shall be subject to Him, who did subject to him the all things, that God may be the all in all."
46,15,29,"Seeing what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? why also are they baptized for the dead?"
46,15,30,"why also do we stand in peril every hour?"
46,15,31,"Every day do I die, by the glorying of you that I have in Christ Jesus our Lord:"
46,15,32,"if after the manner of a man with wild beasts I fought in Ephesus, what the advantage to me if the dead do not rise? let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die!"
46,15,33,"Be not led astray; evil communications corrupt good manners;"
46,15,34,"awake up, as is right, and sin not; for certain have an ignorance of God; for shame to you I say"
46,15,35,"But some one will say, 'How do the dead rise?"
46,15,36,"unwise! you -- what you do sow is not quickened except it may die;"
46,15,37,"and that which you do sow, not the body that shall be do you sow, but bare grain, it may be of wheat, or of some one of the others,"
46,15,38,"and God does give to it a body according as He willed, and to each of the seeds its proper body."
46,15,39,"All flesh"
46,15,40,"and"
46,15,41,"one glory of sun, and another glory of moon, and another glory of stars, for star from star does differ in glory."
46,15,42,"So also"
46,15,43,"it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;"
46,15,44,"it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body;"
46,15,45,"so also it has been written, 'The first man Adam became a living creature,' the last Adam"
46,15,46,"but that which is spiritual"
46,15,47,"The first man"
46,15,48,"as"
46,15,49,"and, according as we did bear the image of the earthy, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly."
46,15,50,"And this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood the reign of God is not able to inherit, nor does the corruption inherit the incorruption;"
46,15,51,"lo, I tell you a secret; we indeed shall not all sleep, and we all shall be changed;"
46,15,52,"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, in the last trumpet, for it shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we -- we shall be changed:"
46,15,53,"for it behooves this corruptible to put on incorruption, and this mortal to put on immortality;"
46,15,54,"and when this corruptible may have put on incorruption, and this mortal may have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the word that has been written, 'The Death was swallowed up -- to victory;"
46,15,55,"where, O Death, thy sting? where, O Hades, thy victory?'"
46,15,56,"and the sting of the death"
46,15,57,"and to God -- thanks, to Him who is giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ;"
46,15,58,"so that, my brethren beloved, become you stedfast, unmovable, abounding in the work of the Lord at all times, knowing that your labour is not vain in the Lord."
46,16,1,"And concerning the collection that"
46,16,2,"on every first"
46,16,3,"and whenever I may come, whomsoever you may approve, through letters, these I will send to carry your favour to Jerusalem;"
46,16,4,"and if it be meet for me also to go, with me they shall go."
46,16,5,"And I will come unto you, when I pass through Macedonia -- for Macedonia I do pass through --"
46,16,6,"and with you, it may be, I will abide, or even winter, that you may send me forward whithersoever I go,"
46,16,7,"for I do not wish to see you now in the passing, but I hope to remain a certain time with you, if the Lord may permit;"
46,16,8,"and I will remain in Ephesus till the Pentecost,"
46,16,9,"for a door to me has been opened -- great and effectual -- and withstanders"
46,16,10,"And if Timotheus may come, see that he may become without fear with you, for the work of the Lord he does work, even as I,"
46,16,11,"no one, then, may despise him; and send you him forward in peace, that he may come to me, for I expect him with the brethren;"
46,16,12,"and concerning Apollos our brother, much I did entreat him that he may come unto you with the brethren, and it was not at all"
46,16,13,"Watch you, stand in the faith; be men, be strong;"
46,16,14,"let all your things be done in love."
46,16,15,"And I entreat you, brethren, you have known the household of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruit of Achaia, and to the ministration to the saints they did set themselves --"
46,16,16,"that you also be subject to such, and to every one who is working with"
46,16,17,"and I rejoice over the presence of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because the lack of you did these fill up;"
46,16,18,"for they did refresh my spirit and yours; acknowledge you, therefore, those who"
46,16,19,"Salute you do the assemblies of Asia; salute you much in the Lord do Aquilas and Priscilla, with the assembly in their house;"
46,16,20,"salute you do all the brethren; salute you one another in an holy kiss."
46,16,21,"The salutation of"
46,16,22,"if any one does not love the Lord Jesus Christ -- let him be anathema! The Lord has come!"
46,16,23,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ"
46,16,24,"my love"
47,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, and Timotheus the brother, to the assembly of God that is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:"
47,1,2,"Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
47,1,3,"Blessed"
47,1,4,"who is comforting us in all our tribulation, for our being able to comfort those in any tribulation through the comfort with which we are comforted ourselves by God;"
47,1,5,"because, as the sufferings of the Christ do abound to us, so through the Christ does abound also our comfort;"
47,1,6,"and whether we be in tribulation,"
47,1,7,"and our hope"
47,1,8,"For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of our tribulation that happened to us in Asia, that we were exceedingly burdened above"
47,1,9,"but we ourselves in ourselves the sentence of the death have had, that we may not be trusting on ourselves, but on God, who is raising the dead,"
47,1,10,"who out of so great a death did deliver us, and does deliver, in whom we have hoped that even yet He will deliver;"
47,1,11,"you working together also for us by your supplication, that the gift through many persons to us, through many may be thankfully acknowledged for us."
47,1,12,"For our glorying is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we did conduct ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you;"
47,1,13,"for no other things do we write to you, but what you either do read or also acknowledge, and I hope that also unto the end you shall acknowledge,"
47,1,14,"according as also you did acknowledge us in part, that your glory we are, even as also you"
47,1,15,"and in this confidence I was purposing to come unto you before, that a second favour you might have,"
47,1,16,"and through you to pass to Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and by you to be sent forward to Judea."
47,1,17,"This, therefore, counselling, did I then use the lightness; or the things that I counsel, according to the flesh do I counsel, that it may be with me Yes, yes, and No, no?"
47,1,18,"and God"
47,1,19,"for the Son of God, Jesus Christ, among you through us having been preached -- through me and Silvanus and Timotheus -- did not become Yes and No, but in him it has become Yes;"
47,1,20,"for as many as"
47,1,21,"and He who is confirming you with us into Christ, and did anoint us,"
47,1,22,"who also sealed us, and gave the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
47,1,23,"And I for a witness on God do call upon my soul, that sparing you, I came not yet to Corinth;"
47,1,24,"not that we are lords over your faith, but we are workers together with your joy, for by the faith you stand."
47,2,1,"And I decided this to myself, not again to come in sorrow unto you,"
47,2,2,"for if I make you sorry, then who is he who is making me glad, except he who is made sorry by me?"
47,2,3,"and I wrote to you this same thing, that having come, I may not have sorrow from them of whom it behoved me to have joy, having confidence in you all, that my joy is of you all,"
47,2,4,"for out of much tribulation and pressure of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that you might be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have more abundantly toward you."
47,2,5,"And if any one has caused sorrow, he has not caused sorrow to me, but in part, that I may not burden you all;"
47,2,6,"sufficient to such a one is this punishment, that"
47,2,7,"so that, on the contrary,"
47,2,8,"therefore, I call upon you to confirm love to him,"
47,2,9,"for, for this also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether in regard to all things you are obedient."
47,2,10,"And to whom you forgive anything -- I also; for I also, if I have forgiven anything, to whom I have forgiven"
47,2,11,"that we may not be over-reached by the Adversary, for of his devices we are not ignorant."
47,2,12,"And having come to Troas for the good news of the Christ, and a door to me having been opened in the Lord,"
47,2,13,"I have not had rest to my spirit, on my not finding Titus my brother, but having taken leave of them, I went forth to Macedonia;"
47,2,14,"and to God"
47,2,15,"because of Christ a sweet fragrance we are to God, in those being saved, and in those being lost;"
47,2,16,"to the one, indeed, a fragrance of death to death, and to the other, a fragrance of life to life; and for these things who is sufficient?"
47,2,17,"for we are not as the many, adulterating the word of God, but as of sincerity -- but as of God; in the presence of God, in Christ we do speak."
47,3,1,"Do we begin again to recommend ourselves, except we need, as some, letters of recommendation unto you, or from you?"
47,3,2,"our letter you are, having been written in our hearts, known and read by all men,"
47,3,3,"manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in the tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart,"
47,3,4,"and such trust we have through the Christ toward God,"
47,3,5,"not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything, as of ourselves, but our sufficiency"
47,3,6,"who also made us sufficient"
47,3,7,"and if the ministration of the death, in letters, engraved in stones, came in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to look stedfastly to the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face -- which was being made useless,"
47,3,8,"how shall the ministration of the Spirit not be more in glory?"
47,3,9,"for if the ministration of the condemnation"
47,3,10,"for also even that which has been glorious, has not been glorious -- in this respect, because of the superior glory;"
47,3,11,"for if that which is being made useless"
47,3,12,"Having, then, such hope, we use much freedom of speech,"
47,3,13,"and"
47,3,14,"but their minds were hardened, for unto this day the same vail at the reading of the Old Covenant does remain unwithdrawn -- which in Christ is being made useless --"
47,3,15,"but till to-day, when Moses is read, a vail upon their heart does lie,"
47,3,16,"and whenever they may turn unto the Lord, the vail is taken away."
47,3,17,"And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord"
47,3,18,"and we all, with unveiled face, the glory of the Lord beholding in a mirror, to the same image are being transformed, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord."
47,4,1,"Because of this, having this ministration, according as we did receive kindness, we do not faint,"
47,4,2,"but did renounce for ourselves the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor deceitfully using the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth recommending ourselves unto every conscience of men, before God;"
47,4,3,"and if also our good news is veiled, in those perishing it is veiled,"
47,4,4,"in whom the god of this age did blind the minds of the unbelieving, that there does not shine forth to them the enlightening of the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God;"
47,4,5,"for not ourselves do we preach, but Christ Jesus -- Lord, and ourselves your servants because of Jesus;"
47,4,6,"because"
47,4,7,"And we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us;"
47,4,8,"on every side being in tribulation, but not straitened; perplexed, but not in despair;"
47,4,9,"persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;"
47,4,10,"at all times the dying of the Lord Jesus bearing about in the body, that the life also of Jesus in our body may be manifested,"
47,4,11,"for always are we who are living delivered up to death because of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our dying flesh,"
47,4,12,"so that, the death indeed in us does work, and the life in you."
47,4,13,"And having the same spirit of the faith, according to that which has been written, 'I believed, therefore I did speak;' we also do believe, therefore also do we speak;"
47,4,14,"knowing that He who did raise up the Lord Jesus, us also through Jesus shall raise up, and shall present with you,"
47,4,15,"for the all things"
47,4,16,"therefore, we faint not, but if also our outward man does decay, yet the inward is renewed day by day;"
47,4,17,"for the momentary light matter of our tribulation, more and more exceedingly an age-during weight of glory does work out for us --"
47,4,18,"we not looking to the things seen, but to the things not seen; for the things seen"
47,5,1,"For we have known that if our earthly house of the tabernacle may be thrown down, a building from God we have, an house not made with hands -- age-during -- in the heavens,"
47,5,2,"for also in this we groan, with our dwelling that is from heaven earnestly desiring to clothe ourselves,"
47,5,3,"if so be that, having clothed ourselves, we shall not be found naked,"
47,5,4,"for we also who are in the tabernacle do groan, being burdened, seeing we wish not to unclothe ourselves, but to clothe ourselves, that the mortal may be swallowed up of the life."
47,5,5,"And He who did work us to this self-same thing"
47,5,6,"having courage, then, at all times, and knowing that being at home in the body, we are away from home from the Lord, --"
47,5,7,"for through faith we walk, not through sight --"
47,5,8,"we have courage, and are well pleased rather to be away from the home of the body, and to be at home with the Lord."
47,5,9,"Therefore also we are ambitious, whether at home or away from home, to be well pleasing to him,"
47,5,10,"for all of us it behooves to be manifested before the tribunal of the Christ, that each one may receive the things"
47,5,11,"having known, therefore, the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, and to God we are manifested, and I hope also in your consciences to have been manifested;"
47,5,12,"for not again ourselves do we recommend to you, but we are giving occasion to you of glorifying in our behalf, that you may have"
47,5,13,"for whether we were beside ourselves,"
47,5,14,"for the love of the Christ does constrain us, having judged thus: that if one for all died, then the whole died,"
47,5,15,"and for all he died, that those living, no more to themselves may live, but to him who died for them, and was raised again."
47,5,16,"So that we henceforth have known no one according to the flesh, and even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him no more;"
47,5,17,"so that if any one"
47,5,18,"And the all things"
47,5,19,"how that God was in Christ -- a world reconciling to Himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses; and having put in us the word of the reconciliation,"
47,5,20,"in behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as if God were calling through us, we beseech, in behalf of Christ, 'Be you reconciled to God;'"
47,5,21,"for him who did not know sin, in our behalf He did make sin, that we may become the righteousness of God in him."
47,6,1,"And working together also we call upon"
47,6,2,"for He says, 'In an acceptable time I did hear you, and in a day of salvation I did help you, lo, now"
47,6,3,"in nothing giving any cause of offence, that the ministration may be not blamed,"
47,6,4,"but in everything recommending ourselves as God's ministrants; in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in distresses,"
47,6,5,"in stripes, in imprisonments, in insurrections, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,"
47,6,6,"in pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,"
47,6,7,"in the word of truth, in the power of God, through the armour of the righteousness, on the right and on the left,"
47,6,8,"through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report, as leading astray, and true;"
47,6,9,"as unknown, and recognized; as dying, and lo, we live; as chastened, and not put to death;"
47,6,10,"as sorrowful, and always rejoicing; as poor, and making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things."
47,6,11,"Our mouth has been open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart has been enlarged!"
47,6,12,"you are not straitened in us, and you are straitened in your"
47,6,13,"and"
47,6,14,"Become not yoked with others -- unbelievers, for what partaking"
47,6,15,"and what fellowship to light with darkness? and what concord to Christ with Belial? or what part to a believer with an unbeliever?"
47,6,16,"and what agreement to the sanctuary of God with idols? for you are a sanctuary of the living God, according as God said -- 'I will dwell in them, and will walk among"
47,6,17,"therefore, come you forth out of the midst of them, and be separated, says the Lord, and an unclean thing do not touch, and I -- I will receive you,"
47,6,18,"and I will be to you for a Father, and you -- you shall be to Me for sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.'"
47,7,1,"Having, then, these promises, beloved, may we cleanse ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting sanctification in the fear of God;"
47,7,2,"receive us; no one did we wrong; no one did we waste; no one did we defraud;"
47,7,3,"not to condemn you do I say"
47,7,4,"great"
47,7,5,"for also we, having come to Macedonia, no relaxation has our flesh had, but on every side we are in tribulation, without"
47,7,6,"but He who is comforting the cast-down -- God -- He did comfort us in the presence of Titus;"
47,7,7,"and not only in his presence, but also in the comfort with which he was comforted over you, declaring to us your longing desire, your lamentation, your zeal for me, so that the more I did rejoice,"
47,7,8,"because even if I made you sorry in the letter, I do not repent -- if even I did repent -- for I perceive that the letter, even if for an hour, did make you sorry."
47,7,9,"I now do rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to reformation, for you were made sorry toward God, that in nothing you might receive damage from us;"
47,7,10,"for the sorrow toward God reformation to salvation not to be repented of does work, and the sorrow of the world does work death,"
47,7,11,"for, lo, this same thing -- your being made sorry toward God -- how much diligence it does work in you! but defence, but displeasure, but fear, but longing desire, but zeal, but revenge; in every thing you did approve yourselves to be pure in the matter."
47,7,12,"If, then, I also wrote to you -- not for his cause who did wrong, nor for his cause who did suffer wrong, but for our diligence in your behalf being manifested unto you before God --"
47,7,13,"because of this we have been comforted in your comfort, and more abundantly the more did we rejoice in the joy of Titus, that his spirit has been refreshed from you all;"
47,7,14,"because if anything to him in your behalf I have boasted, I was not put to shame; but as all things in truth we did speak to you, so also our boasting before Titus became truth,"
47,7,15,"and his tender affection is more abundantly toward you, remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you did receive him;"
47,7,16,"I rejoice, therefore, that in everything I have courage in you."
47,8,1,"And we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God, that has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia,"
47,8,2,"because in much trial of tribulation the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty, did abound to the riches of their liberality;"
47,8,3,"because, according to"
47,8,4,"with much entreaty calling on us to receive the favour and the fellowship of the ministration to the saints,"
47,8,5,"and not according as we expected, but themselves they did give first to the Lord, and to us, through the will of God,"
47,8,6,"so that we exhorted Titus, that, according as he did begin before, so also he may finish to you also this favour,"
47,8,7,"but even as in every thing you do abound, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us, that also in this grace you may abound;"
47,8,8,"not according to command do I speak, but because of the diligence of others, and of your love proving the genuineness,"
47,8,9,"for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that because of you he became poor -- being rich, that you by that poverty may become rich."
47,8,10,"And an opinion in this do I give: for this to you"
47,8,11,"and now also finish doing"
47,8,12,"for if the willing mind is present, according to that which any one may have it is well-accepted, not according to that which he has not;"
47,8,13,"for not that for others release, and you pressured,"
47,8,14,"but by equality, at the present time your abundance -- for their want, that also their abundance may be for your want, that there may be equality,"
47,8,15,"according as it has been written, 'He who"
47,8,16,"And thanks to God, who is putting the same diligence for you in the heart of Titus,"
47,8,17,"because indeed the exhortation he accepted, and being more diligent, of his own accord he went forth unto you,"
47,8,18,"and we sent with him the brother, whose praise in the good news"
47,8,19,"and not only so, but who was also appointed by vote by the assemblies, our fellow-traveller, with this favour that is ministered by us, unto the glory of the same Lord, and your willing mind;"
47,8,20,"avoiding this, lest any one may blame us in this abundance that is ministered by us,"
47,8,21,"providing right things, not only before the Lord, but also before men;"
47,8,22,"and we sent with them our brother, whom we proved in many things many times being diligent, and now much more diligent, by the great confidence that is toward you,"
47,8,23,"whether -- about Titus -- my partner and towards you fellow-worker, whether -- our brethren, apostles of assemblies -- glory of Christ;"
47,8,24,"the shewing therefore of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf, to them shew you, even in the face of the assemblies."
47,9,1,"For, indeed, concerning the ministration that"
47,9,2,"for I have known your readiness of mind, which in your behalf I boast of to Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared a year ago, and the zeal of you did stir up the more part,"
47,9,3,"and I sent the brethren, that our boasting on your behalf may not be made vain in this respect; that, according as I said, you may be ready,"
47,9,4,"lest if Macedonians may come with me, and find you unprepared, we -- we may be put to shame (that we say not -- you) in this same confidence of boasting."
47,9,5,"Necessary, therefore, I thought"
47,9,6,"And this: He who is sowing sparingly, sparingly also shall reap; and he who is sowing in blessings, in blessings also shall reap;"
47,9,7,"each one, according as he does purpose in heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for a cheerful giver does God love,"
47,9,8,"and God"
47,9,9,"(according as it has been written, 'He dispersed abroad, he gave to the poor, his righteousness does remain to the age,')"
47,9,10,"and may He who is supplying seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness,"
47,9,11,"in every thing being enriched to all liberality, which does work through us thanksgiving to God,"
47,9,12,"because the ministration of this service not only is supplying the wants of the saints, but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God,"
47,9,13,"through the proof of this ministration glorifying God for the subjection of your confession to the good news of the Christ, and"
47,9,14,"and by their supplication in your behalf, longing after you because of the exceeding grace of God upon you;"
47,9,15,"thanks also to God for His unspeakable gift!"
47,10,1,"And I, Paul, myself, do call upon you -- through the meekness and gentleness of the Christ -- who in presence, indeed"
47,10,2,"and I beseech"
47,10,3,"for walking in the flesh, not according to the flesh do we war,"
47,10,4,"for the weapons of our warfare"
47,10,5,"reasonings bringing down, and every high thing lifted up against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of the Christ,"
47,10,6,"and being in readiness to avenge every disobedience, whenever your obedience may be fulfilled."
47,10,7,"The things in presence do you see? if any one has trusted in himself to be Christ's, this let him reckon again from himself, that according as he is Christ's, so also we"
47,10,8,"for even if also anything more abundantly I shall boast concerning our authority, that the Lord gave us for building up, and not for casting you down, I shall not be ashamed;"
47,10,9,"that I may not seem as if I would terrify you through the letters,"
47,10,10,"'because the letters indeed -- says one --"
47,10,11,"This one -- let him reckon thus: that such as we are in word, through letters, being absent, such also, being present,"
47,10,12,"For we do not make bold to rank or to compare ourselves with certain of those commending themselves, but they, among themselves measuring themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise,"
47,10,13,"and we in regard to the unmeasured things will not boast ourselves, but after the measure of the line that the God of measure did appoint to us -- to reach even unto you;"
47,10,14,"for not as not reaching to you do we stretch ourselves overmuch, for even unto you did we come in the good news of the Christ,"
47,10,15,"not boasting of the things not measured, in other men's labours, and having hope -- your faith increasing -- in you to be enlarged, according to our line -- into abundance,"
47,10,16,"in the"
47,10,17,"and he who is boasting -- in the Lord let him boast;"
47,10,18,"for not he who is commending himself is approved, but he whom the Lord does commend."
47,11,1,"O that you were bearing with me a little of the folly, but you also do bear with me:"
47,11,2,"for I am zealous for you with zeal of God, for I did betroth you to one husband, a pure virgin, to present to Christ,"
47,11,3,"and I fear, lest, as the serpent did beguile Eve in his subtilty, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that"
47,11,4,"for if, indeed, he who is coming does preach another Jesus whom we did not preach, or another Spirit you receive which you did not receive, or other good news which you did not accept -- well were you bearing"
47,11,5,"for I reckon that I have been nothing behind the very chiefest apostles,"
47,11,6,"and even if unlearned in word -- yet not in knowledge, but in every thing we were made manifest in all things to you."
47,11,7,"The sin did I do -- myself humbling that you might be exalted, because freely the good news of God I did proclaim to you?"
47,11,8,"other assemblies I did rob, having taken wages, for your ministration;"
47,11,9,"and being present with you, and having been in want, I was chargeable to no one, for my lack did the brethren supply -- having come from Macedonia -- and in everything burdenless to you I did keep myself, and will keep."
47,11,10,"The truth of Christ is in me, because this boasting shall not be stopped in regard to me in the regions of Achaia;"
47,11,11,"therefore? because I do not love you? God has known!"
47,11,12,"and what I do, I also will do, that I may cut off the occasion of those wishing an occasion, that in that which they boast they may be found according as we also;"
47,11,13,"for those such"
47,11,14,"and no wonder -- for even the Adversary does transform himself into a messenger of light;"
47,11,15,"no great thing, then, if also his ministrants do transform themselves as ministrants of righteousness -- whose end shall be according to their works."
47,11,16,"Again I say, may no one think me to be a fool; and if otherwise, even as a fool receive me, that I also a little may boast."
47,11,17,"That which I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this the confidence of boasting;"
47,11,18,"since many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast:"
47,11,19,"for gladly do you bear with the fools -- being wise,"
47,11,20,"for you bear, if any one is bringing you under bondage, if any one does devour, if any one does take away, if any one does exalt himself, if any one on the face does smite you;"
47,11,21,"in reference to dishonour I speak, how that we were weak, and in whatever any one is bold -- in foolishness I say"
47,11,22,"Hebrews are they? I also! Israelites are they? I also! seed of Abraham are they? I also!"
47,11,23,"ministrants of Christ are they? -- as beside myself I speak -- I more; in labours more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths many times;"
47,11,24,"from Jews five times forty"
47,11,25,"thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice was I shipwrecked, a night and a day in the deep I have passed;"
47,11,26,"journeyings many times, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from kindred, perils from nations, perils in city, perils in wilderness, perils in sea, perils among false brethren;"
47,11,27,"in laboriousness and painfulness, in watchings many times, in hunger and thirst, in fastings many times, in cold and nakedness;"
47,11,28,"apart from the things without -- the crowding upon me that is daily -- the care of all the assemblies."
47,11,29,"Who is infirm, and I am not infirm? who is stumbled, and I am not fired;"
47,11,30,"if to boast it behooves"
47,11,31,"the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ -- who is blessed to the ages -- has known that I do not lie! --"
47,11,32,"In Damascus the ethnarch of Aretas the king was watching the city of the Damascenes, wishing to seize me,"
47,11,33,"and through a window in a rope basket I was let down, through the wall, and fled out of his hands."
47,12,1,"To boast, really, is not profitable for me, for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord."
47,12,2,"I have known a man in Christ, fourteen years ago -- whether in the body I have not known, whether out of the body I have not known, God has known -- such an one being caught away unto the third heaven;"
47,12,3,"and I have known such a man -- whether in the body, whether out of the body, I have not known, God has known, --"
47,12,4,"that he was caught away to the paradise, and heard unutterable sayings, that it is not possible for man to speak."
47,12,5,"Of such an one I will boast, and of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities,"
47,12,6,"for if I may wish to boast, I shall not be a fool, for truth I will say; but I forebear, lest any one in regard to me may think anything above what he does see me, or does hear anything of me;"
47,12,7,"and that by the exceeding greatness of the revelations I might not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of the Adversary, that he might buffet me, that I might not be exalted overmuch."
47,12,8,"Concerning this thing thrice the Lord did I call upon, that it might depart from me,"
47,12,9,"and He said to me,"
47,12,10,"therefore I am well pleased in infirmities, in damages, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses -- for Christ; for whenever I am infirm, then I am powerful;"
47,12,11,"I have become a fool -- boasting; you -- you did compel me; for I ought by you to have been commended, for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles -- even if I am nothing."
47,12,12,"The signs, indeed, of the apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds,"
47,12,13,"for what is there in which you were inferior to the rest of the assemblies, except that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this injustice!"
47,12,14,"Lo, a third time I am ready to come unto you, and I will not be a burden to you, for I seek not yours, but you, for the children ought not for the parents to lay up, but the parents for the children,"
47,12,15,"and I most gladly will spend and be entirely spent for your souls, even if, more abundantly loving you, less I am loved."
47,12,16,"And be it"
47,12,17,"any one of those whom I have sent unto you -- by him did I take advantage of you?"
47,12,18,"I entreated Titus, and did send with"
47,12,19,"Again, think you that to you we are making defence? before God in Christ do we speak; and the all things, beloved,"
47,12,20,"for I fear lest, having come, not such as I wish I may find you, and I -- I may be found by you such as you do not wish, lest there be strifes, envyings, wraths, revelries, evil-speakings, whisperings, puffings up, insurrections,"
47,12,21,"lest again having come, my God may humble me in regard to you, and I may bewail many of those having sinned before, and not having reformed concerning the uncleanness, and whoredom, and lasciviousness, that they did practise."
47,13,1,"This third time do I come unto you; on the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every saying be established;"
47,13,2,"I have said before, and I say"
47,13,3,"since a proof you seek of the Christ speaking in me, who to you is not infirm, but is powerful in you,"
47,13,4,"for even if he was crucified from infirmity, yet he does live from the power of God; for we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him from the power of God toward you."
47,13,5,"Your ownselves try you, if you are in the faith; your ownselves prove you; do you not know your ownselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, if you be not in some respect disapproved of?"
47,13,6,"and I hope that you shall know that we -- we are not disapproved of;"
47,13,7,"and I pray before God that you do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is right, and we may be as disapproved;"
47,13,8,"for we are not able to do anything against the truth, but for the truth;"
47,13,9,"for we rejoice when we may be infirm, and you may be powerful; and this also we pray for -- your perfection!"
47,13,10,"because of this, these things -- being absent -- I write, that being present, I may not treat"
47,13,11,"Henceforth, brethren, rejoice; be made perfect, be comforted, be of the same mind, be at peace, and the God of the love and peace shall be with you;"
47,13,12,"salute one another in an holy kiss;"
47,13,13,"salute you do all the saints;"
47,13,14,"the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,"
48,1,1,"Paul, an apostle -- not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who did raise him out of the dead --"
48,1,2,"and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:"
48,1,3,"Grace to you, and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,"
48,1,4,"who did give himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of the present evil age, according to the will of God even our Father,"
48,1,5,"to whom"
48,1,6,"I wonder that you are so quickly removed from Him who did call you in the grace of Christ to another good news;"
48,1,7,"that is not another, except there be certain who are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of the Christ;"
48,1,8,"but even if we or a messenger out of heaven may proclaim good news to you different from what we did proclaim to you -- accursed let him be!"
48,1,9,"as we have said before, and now say again, If any one to you may proclaim good news different from what you did receive -- accursed let him be!"
48,1,10,"for now men do I persuade, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if yet men I did please -- Christ's servant I should not be."
48,1,11,"And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that were proclaimed by me, that it is not according to man,"
48,1,12,"for neither did I from man receive it, nor was I taught"
48,1,13,"for you did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism, that exceedingly I was persecuting the assembly of God, and wasting it,"
48,1,14,"and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in mine own race, being more abundantly zealous of my fathers' deliverances,"
48,1,15,"and when God was well pleased -- having separated me from the womb of my mother, and having called"
48,1,16,"to reveal His Son in me, that I might proclaim him good news among the nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,"
48,1,17,"nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus,"
48,1,18,"then, after three years I went up to Jerusalem to enquire about Peter, and remained with him fifteen days,"
48,1,19,"and other of the apostles I did not see, except James, the brother of the Lord."
48,1,20,"And the things that I write to you, lo, before God -- I lie not;"
48,1,21,"then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,"
48,1,22,"and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea, that"
48,1,23,"and only they were hearing, that 'he who is persecuting us then, do now proclaim good news -- the faith that then he was wasting;'"
48,1,24,"and they were glorifying God in me."
48,2,1,"Then, after fourteen years again I went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken with me also Titus;"
48,2,2,"and I went up by revelation, and did submit to them the good news that I preach among the nations, and privately to those esteemed, lest in vain I might run or did run;"
48,2,3,"but not even Titus, who"
48,2,4,"and"
48,2,5,"to whom not even for an hour we gave place by subjection, that the truth of the good news might remain to you."
48,2,6,"And from those who were esteemed to be something -- whatever they were then, it makes no difference to me -- the face of man God accepts not, for -- to me those esteemed did add nothing,"
48,2,7,"but, on the contrary, having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of the uncircumcision, as Peter with"
48,2,8,"for He who did work with Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, did work also in me in regard to the nations,"
48,2,9,"and having known the grace that was given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, who were esteemed to be pillars, a right hand of fellowship they did give to me, and to Barnabas, that we to the nations, and they to the circumcision"
48,2,10,"only, of the poor that we should be mindful, which also I was diligent -- this very thing -- to do."
48,2,11,"And when Peter came to Antioch, to the face I stood up against him, because he was blameworthy,"
48,2,12,"for before the coming of certain from James, with the nations he was eating, and when they came, he was withdrawing and separating himself, fearing those of the circumcision,"
48,2,13,"and dissemble with him also did the other Jews, so that also Barnabas was carried away by their dissimulation."
48,2,14,"But when I saw that they are not walking uprightly to the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, 'If you, being a Jew, in the manner of the nations do live, and not in the manner of the Jews, how the nations do you compel to Judaize?"
48,2,15,"we by nature Jews, and not sinners of the nations,"
48,2,16,"having known also that a man is not declared righteous by works of law, if not through the faith of Jesus Christ, also we in Christ Jesus did believe, that we might be declared righteous by the faith of Christ, and not by works of law, wherefore declared righteous by works of law shall be no flesh.'"
48,2,17,"And if, seeking to be declared righteous in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners,"
48,2,18,"for if the things I threw down, these again I build up, a transgressor I set myself forth;"
48,2,19,"for I through law, did die, that to God I may live;"
48,2,20,"with Christ I have been crucified, and live no more do I, and Christ does live in me; and that which I now live in the flesh -- in the faith I live of the Son of God, who did love me and did give himself for me;"
48,2,21,"I do not make void the grace of God, for if righteousness"
48,3,1,"O thoughtless Galatians, who did bewitch you, not to obey the truth -- before whose eyes Jesus Christ was described before among you crucified?"
48,3,2,"this only do I wish to learn from you -- by works of law the Spirit did you receive, or by the hearing of faith?"
48,3,3,"so thoughtless are you! having begun in the Spirit, now in the flesh do you end?"
48,3,4,"so many things did you suffer in vain! if, indeed, even in vain."
48,3,5,"He, therefore, who is supplying to you the Spirit, and working mighty acts among you -- by works of law or by the hearing of faith"
48,3,6,"according as Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;"
48,3,7,"know you, then, that those of faith -- these are sons of Abraham,"
48,3,8,"and the Writing having foreseen that by faith God does declare righteous the nations did proclaim before the good news to Abraham --"
48,3,9,"'Blessed in you shall be all the nations;' so that those of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham,"
48,3,10,"for as many as are of works of law are under a curse, for it has been written, 'Cursed"
48,3,11,"and that in law no one is declared righteous with God, is evident, because 'The righteous by faith shall live;'"
48,3,12,"and the law is not by faith, but -- 'The man who did them shall live in them.'"
48,3,13,"Christ did redeem us from the curse of the law, having become for us a curse, for it has been written, 'Cursed is every one who is hanging on a tree,'"
48,3,14,"that to the nations the blessing of Abraham may come in Christ Jesus, that the promise of the Spirit we may receive through the faith."
48,3,15,"Brethren, as a man I say"
48,3,16,"and to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed; He does not say, 'And to seeds,' as of many, but as of one, 'And to thy seed,' which is Christ;"
48,3,17,"and this I say, A covenant confirmed before by God to Christ, the law, that came four hundred and thirty years after, does not set aside, to make void the promise,"
48,3,18,"for if by law"
48,3,19,"Why, then, the law? on account of the transgressions it was added, till the seed might come to which the promise has been made, having been set in order through messengers in the hand of a mediator --"
48,3,20,"and the mediator is not of one, and God is one --"
48,3,21,"the law, then,"
48,3,22,"but the Writing did shut up the whole under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ may be given to those believing."
48,3,23,"And before the coming of the faith, under law we were being kept, shut up to the faith about to be revealed,"
48,3,24,"so that the law became our child-conductor -- to Christ, that by faith we may be declared righteous,"
48,3,25,"and the faith having come, no more under a child-conductor are we,"
48,3,26,"for you are all sons of God through the faith in Christ Jesus,"
48,3,27,"for as many as to Christ were baptized did put on Christ;"
48,3,28,"there is not here Jew or Greek, there is not here servant nor freeman, there is not here male and female, for all you are one in Christ Jesus;"
48,3,29,"and if you"
48,4,1,"And I say, so long time as the heir is a babe, he differs nothing from a servant -- being lord of all,"
48,4,2,"but is under tutors and stewards till the time appointed of the father,"
48,4,3,"so also we, when we were babes, under the elements of the world were in servitude,"
48,4,4,"and when the fulness of time did come, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law,"
48,4,5,"that those under law he may redeem, that the adoption of sons we may receive;"
48,4,6,"and because you are sons, God did send forth the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father!'"
48,4,7,"so that you are no more a servant, but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ."
48,4,8,"But then, indeed, not having known God, you were in servitude to those not by nature gods,"
48,4,9,"and now, having known God -- and rather being known by God -- how turn you again unto the weak and poor elements to which anew you desire to be in servitude?"
48,4,10,"days you observe, and months, and times, and years!"
48,4,11,"I am afraid for you, lest in vain I did labour toward you."
48,4,12,"Become as I"
48,4,13,"and you have known that through infirmity of the flesh I did proclaim good news to you at the first,"
48,4,14,"and my trial that"
48,4,15,"what then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that if possible, your eyes having plucked out, you would have given to me;"
48,4,16,"so that your enemy have I become, being true to you?"
48,4,17,"they are zealous for you --"
48,4,18,"and"
48,4,19,"my little children, of whom again I travail in birth, till Christ may be formed in you,"
48,4,20,"and I was wishing to be present with you now, and to change my voice, because I am in doubt about you."
48,4,21,"Tell me, you who are willing to be under law, the law do you not hear?"
48,4,22,"for it has been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the maid-servant, and one by the free-woman,"
48,4,23,"but he who"
48,4,24,"which things are allegorized, for these are the two covenants: one, indeed, from mount Sinai, to servitude bringing forth, which is Hagar;"
48,4,25,"for this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and does correspond to the Jerusalem that now"
48,4,26,"and the Jerusalem above is the free-woman, which is mother of us all,"
48,4,27,"for it has been written, 'Rejoice, O barren, who are not bearing; break forth and cry, you who are not travailing, because many"
48,4,28,"And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise,"
48,4,29,"but as then he who was born according to the flesh did persecute him according to the spirit, so also now;"
48,4,30,"but what saith the Writing? 'Cast forth the maid-servant and her son, for the son of the maid-servant may not be heir with the son of the free-woman;'"
48,4,31,"then, brethren, we are not a maid-servant's children, but the free-woman's."
48,5,1,"In the freedom, then, with which Christ did make you free -- stand you, and be not held fast again by a yoke of servitude;"
48,5,2,"lo, I Paul do say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing;"
48,5,3,"and I testify again to every man circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law;"
48,5,4,"you were freed from the Christ, you who in law are declared righteous; from the grace you fell away;"
48,5,5,"for we by the Spirit, by faith, a hope of righteousness do wait for,"
48,5,6,"for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith through love working."
48,5,7,"You were running well; who did hinder you -- not to obey the truth?"
48,5,8,"the obedience"
48,5,9,"a little leaven the whole lump does leaven;"
48,5,10,"I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord, that you will be none otherwise minded; and he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be."
48,5,11,"And I, brethren, if uncircumcision I yet preach, why yet am I persecuted? then has the stumbling-block of the cross been done away;"
48,5,12,"O that even they would cut themselves off who are unsettling you!"
48,5,13,"For you -- to freedom you were called, brethren, only not the freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through the love serve you one another,"
48,5,14,"for all the law in one word is fulfilled -- in this: 'You shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;'"
48,5,15,"and if one another you do bite and devour, see -- that you may not by one another be consumed."
48,5,16,"And I say: In the Spirit walk you, and the desire of the flesh you may not complete;"
48,5,17,"for the flesh does desire contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, and these are opposed one to another, that the things that you may will -- these you may not do;"
48,5,18,"and if by the Spirit you are led, you are not under law."
48,5,19,"And manifest also are the works of the flesh, which are: Adultery, whoredom, uncleanness, lasciviousness,"
48,5,20,"idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strifes, emulations, wraths, rivalries, dissensions, sects,"
48,5,21,"envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revellings, and such like, of which I tell you before, as I also said before, that those doing such things the reign of God shall not inherit."
48,5,22,"And the fruit of the Spirit is: Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,"
48,5,23,"meekness, temperance: against such there is no law;"
48,5,24,"and those who are Christ's, the flesh did crucify with the affections, and the desires;"
48,5,25,"if we may live in the Spirit, in the Spirit also we may walk;"
48,5,26,"let us not become vain-glorious -- one another provoking, one another envying!"
48,6,1,"Brethren, if a man also may be overtaken in any trespass, you who"
48,6,2,"of one another the burdens bear you, and so fill up the law of the Christ,"
48,6,3,"for if any one does think"
48,6,4,"and his own work let each one prove, and then in regard to himself alone the glorying he shall have, and not in regard to the other,"
48,6,5,"for each one his own burden shall bear."
48,6,6,"And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who is instructing -- in all good things."
48,6,7,"Be not led astray; God is not mocked; for what a man may sow -- that also he shall reap,"
48,6,8,"because he who is sowing to his own flesh, of the flesh shall reap corruption; and he who is sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap life age-during;"
48,6,9,"and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted, for at the proper time we shall reap -- not desponding;"
48,6,10,"therefore, then, as we have opportunity, may we work the good to all, and especially unto those of the household of the faith."
48,6,11,"You see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand;"
48,6,12,"as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised -- only that for the cross of the Christ they may not be persecuted,"
48,6,13,"for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law, but they wish you to be circumcised, that in your flesh they may glory."
48,6,14,"And for me, let it not be -- to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which to me the world has been crucified, and I to the world;"
48,6,15,"for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation;"
48,6,16,"and as many as by this rule do walk -- peace upon them, and kindness, and on the Israel of God!"
48,6,17,"Henceforth, let no one give me trouble, for I the scars of the Lord Jesus in my body do bear."
48,6,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ"
49,1,1,"Paul, an apostle"
49,1,2,"Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
49,1,3,"Blessed"
49,1,4,"according as He chose us in him before the foundation of the world, for our being holy and unblemished before Him, in love,"
49,1,5,"having foreordained"
49,1,6,"to the praise of the glory of His grace, in which He made us accepted in the beloved"
49,1,7,"in whom we have the redemption"
49,1,8,"in which He did abound"
49,1,9,"having made known to us the secret of His will, according to His good pleasure, that He purposed in Himself,"
49,1,10,"in regard to the dispensation"
49,1,11,"in whom also we did obtain an inheritance, being foreordained"
49,1,12,"for our being to the praise of His glory,"
49,1,13,"in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth -- the good news of your salvation -- in whom also having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise,"
49,1,14,"which is an earnest"
49,1,15,"Because of this I also, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and the love to all the saints,"
49,1,16,"do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,"
49,1,17,"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of the glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the recognition"
49,1,18,"the eyes of your understanding"
49,1,19,"and what the exceeding greatness"
49,1,20,"which He wrought"
49,1,21,"far above all principality, and authority, and might, and lordship, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in the coming one;"
49,1,22,"and all things He did put under his feet, and did give him -- head over all things to the assembly,"
49,1,23,"which is his body, the fulness of Him who is filling the all in all,"
49,2,1,"Also you -- being dead in the trespasses and the sins,"
49,2,2,"in which once you did walk according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience,"
49,2,3,"among whom also we all did walk once in the desires of our flesh, doing the wishes"
49,2,4,"and God, being rich in kindness, because of His great love with which He loved us,"
49,2,5,"even being dead in the trespasses, made us to live together with the Christ, (by grace you are having been saved,)"
49,2,6,"and raised"
49,2,7,"that He might show, in the ages that are coming, the exceeding"
49,2,8,"for by grace you are having been saved, through faith, and this not of you -- of God the gift,"
49,2,9,"not of works, that no one may boast;"
49,2,10,"for of Him we are workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God did before prepare, that in them we may walk."
49,2,11,"Therefore, remember, that you"
49,2,12,"that you were at that time apart from Christ, having been alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope, and without God, in the world;"
49,2,13,"and now, in Christ Jesus, you being once afar off became near in the blood of the Christ,"
49,2,14,"for he is our peace, who did make both one, and the middle wall of the enclosure did break down,"
49,2,15,"the enmity"
49,2,16,"and might reconcile both in one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity"
49,2,17,"and having come, he did proclaim good news -- peace to you -- the far-off and the near,"
49,2,18,"because through him we have the access -- we both -- in one Spirit unto the Father."
49,2,19,"Then, therefore, you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God,"
49,2,20,"being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being chief corner-"
49,2,21,"in whom all the building fitly framed together does increase to an holy sanctuary in the Lord,"
49,2,22,"in whom also you are builded together, for a habitation"
49,3,1,"For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you the nations,"
49,3,2,"if, indeed, you did hear of the dispensation"
49,3,3,"that by revelation He made known to me the secret, according as I wrote before in few"
49,3,4,"in regard to which you are able, reading"
49,3,5,"which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it was now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit --"
49,3,6,"that the nations be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in the Christ, through the good news,"
49,3,7,"of which I became a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God that was given to me, according to the working of His power;"
49,3,8,"to me -- the less than the least of all the saints -- was given this grace, among the nations to proclaim good news -- the untraceable riches of the Christ,"
49,3,9,"and to cause all to see what"
49,3,10,"that there might be made known now to the principalities and the authorities in the heavenly"
49,3,11,"according to a purpose of the ages, which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord,"
49,3,12,"in whom we have the freedom and the access in confidence through the faith of him,"
49,3,13,"wherefore, I ask"
49,3,14,"For this cause I bow"
49,3,15,"of whom the whole family in the heavens and on earth is named,"
49,3,16,"that He may give to you, according to the riches of His glory, with might"
49,3,17,"that the Christ may dwell through the faith in your hearts, in love having been rooted and founded,"
49,3,18,"that you may be in strength to comprehend, with all the saints, what"
49,3,19,"to know also the love of the Christ that is exceeding"
49,3,20,"and to Him who is able above all things to do exceeding abundantly"
49,3,21,"to Him"
49,4,1,"Call upon you, then, do I -- the prisoner of the Lord -- to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,"
49,4,2,"with all lowliness"
49,4,3,"being diligent"
49,4,4,"one body and one Spirit, according as also you were called in one hope of your calling;"
49,4,5,"one Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
49,4,6,"one God and Father of all, who"
49,4,7,"and to each one of you was given the grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ,"
49,4,8,"wherefore, he says, 'Having gone up on high he led captive captivity, and gave gifts to men,' --"
49,4,9,"and that, he went up, what is it except that he also went down first to the lower parts of the earth?"
49,4,10,"he who went down is the same also who went up far above all the heavens, that He may fill all things --"
49,4,11,"and He gave some"
49,4,12,"unto the perfecting"
49,4,13,"till we may all come to the unity of the faith and of the recognition"
49,4,14,"that we may no more be babes"
49,4,15,"and, being true in love, we may increase to Him"
49,4,16,"from whom the whole body, being fitly joined together and united, through the supply of every joint, according to the working in the measure of each single part, the increase of the body does make for the building up of itself in love."
49,4,17,"This, then, I say, and I testify in the Lord; you are no more to walk, as also the other nations walk, in the vanity of their mind,"
49,4,18,"being darkened in the understanding, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart,"
49,4,19,"who, having ceased to feel, themselves did give up to the lasciviousness"
49,4,20,"and you did not so"
49,4,21,"if so be you did hear him, and in him were taught, as truth is in Jesus;"
49,4,22,"you are to put off concerning the former behaviour the old man"
49,4,23,"and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,"
49,4,24,"and to put on the new man, which, according to God, was created in righteousness and kindness of the truth."
49,4,25,"Wherefore, putting away the lying, speak truth each with his neighbour, because we are members one of another;"
49,4,26,"be angry and do not sin; let not the sun go down upon your wrath,"
49,4,27,"neither give place to the devil;"
49,4,28,"whosoever is stealing let him no more steal, but rather let him labour, working the thing that is good with the hands, that he may have to impart"
49,4,29,"Let no corrupt word out of your mouth go forth, but what is good unto the needful building up, that it may give grace to the hearers;"
49,4,30,"and make not sorrowful the Holy Spirit of God, in which you were sealed to a day of redemption."
49,4,31,"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour"
49,4,32,"and become one to another kind, tender-hearted"
49,5,1,"Become, then, followers of God, as children beloved,"
49,5,2,"and walk in love, as also the Christ did love us, and did give himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odour"
49,5,3,"and whoredom"
49,5,4,"also filthiness"
49,5,5,"for this you know, that every whoremonger, or unclean, or covetous person, who is an idolater, has no inheritance in the reign of the Christ and God."
49,5,6,"Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things comes the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience,"
49,5,7,"become not, then, partakers"
49,5,8,"for you were once darkness, and now light in the Lord; as children of light walk you,"
49,5,9,"for the fruit of the Spirit"
49,5,10,"proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord,"
49,5,11,"and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the darkness and rather even convict"
49,5,12,"for the things in secret done by them it is a shame even to speak of,"
49,5,13,"and all the things reproved"
49,5,14,"wherefore he says, 'Arouse yourself, you who are sleeping, and arise out of the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon you.'"
49,5,15,"See, then, how exactly you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,"
49,5,16,"redeeming the time, because the days are evil;"
49,5,17,"because of this become not fools, but -- understanding what"
49,5,18,"and be not drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness"
49,5,19,"speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,"
49,5,20,"giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the God and Father;"
49,5,21,"subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of God."
49,5,22,"The wives! to your own husbands subject"
49,5,23,"because the husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ"
49,5,24,"but even as the assembly is subject to Christ, so also"
49,5,25,"The husbands! love your own wives, as also the Christ did love the assembly, and did give himself for it,"
49,5,26,"that he might sanctify it, having cleansed"
49,5,27,"that he might present it to himself the assembly in glory, not having spot or wrinkle, or any of such things, but that it may be holy and unblemished;"
49,5,28,"so ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies: he who is loving his own wife -- himself he does love;"
49,5,29,"for no one ever his own flesh did hate, but does nourish and cherish it, as also the Lord -- the assembly,"
49,5,30,"because members we are of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones;"
49,5,31,"'for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh;'"
49,5,32,"this secret is great, and I speak in regard to Christ and to the assembly;"
49,5,33,"but you also, every one in particular -- let each his own wife so love as himself, and the wife -- that she may reverence the husband."
49,6,1,"The children! obey your parents in the Lord, for this is righteous;"
49,6,2,"honour your father and mother,"
49,6,3,"which is the first command with a promise, 'That it may be well with you, and you may live a long time upon the land.'"
49,6,4,"And the fathers! provoke not your children, but nourish them in the instruction and admonition"
49,6,5,"The servants! obey the masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to the Christ;"
49,6,6,"not with eye-service as men-pleasers"
49,6,7,"with good-will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men"
49,6,8,"having known that whatever good thing each one may do, this he shall receive from the Lord, whether servant or freeman"
49,6,9,"And the masters! the same things do you unto them, letting threatening alone, having known that also your Master is in the heavens, and acceptance of persons"
49,6,10,"As to the rest, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might;"
49,6,11,"put on the whole armour of God, for your being able to stand against the wiles"
49,6,12,"because we have not the wrestling with blood and flesh, but with the principalities, with the authorities, with the world-rulers of the darkness of this age, with the spiritual things of the evil in the heavenly places;"
49,6,13,"because of this take you up the whole armour of God, that you may be able to resist in the day of the evil, and all things having done -- to stand."
49,6,14,"Stand, therefore, having your loins girt"
49,6,15,"and having the feet shod in the preparation of the good-news of the peace;"
49,6,16,"above all, having taken up the shield of the faith, in which ye shall be able all the fiery darts of the evil one to quench,"
49,6,17,"and the helmet of the salvation receive, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the saying of God,"
49,6,18,"through all prayer and supplication"
49,6,19,"and in behalf of me, that to me may be given a word in the opening of my mouth, in freedom, to make known the secret of the good news,"
49,6,20,"for which I am an ambassador in a chain, that in it I may speak freely -- as it behooves"
49,6,21,"And that you may know -- you also -- the things concerning me -- what I do, all things make known to you shall Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord,"
49,6,22,"whom I did send unto you for this very thing, that you might know the things concerning us, and that he might comfort your hearts."
49,6,23,"Peace to the brethren, and love, with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
49,6,24,"The grace with all those loving our Lord Jesus Christ -- undecayingly! Amen."
50,1,1,"Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with overseers and ministers;"
50,1,2,"Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
50,1,3,"I give thanks to my God upon all the remembrance of you,"
50,1,4,"always, in every supplication of mine for you all, with joy making the supplication,"
50,1,5,"for your contribution to the good news from the first day till now,"
50,1,6,"having been confident of this very thing, that He who did begin in you a good work, will perform"
50,1,7,"according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf of you all, because of my having you in the heart, both in my bonds, and"
50,1,8,"For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ,"
50,1,9,"and this I pray, that your love yet more and more may abound in full knowledge, and all judgment,"
50,1,10,"for your proving the things that differ, that you may be pure and offenceless -- to a day of Christ,"
50,1,11,"being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that"
50,1,12,"And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me, rather to an advancement of the good news have come,"
50,1,13,"so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole praetorium, and to the other places -- all,"
50,1,14,"and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence by my bonds, are more abundantly bold -- fearlessly to speak the word."
50,1,15,"Certain, indeed, even through envy and contention, and certain also through good-will, do preach the Christ;"
50,1,16,"the one, indeed, of rivalry the Christ do proclaim, not purely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds,"
50,1,17,"and the other out of love, having known that for defence of the good news I am set:"
50,1,18,"what then? in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed -- and in this I rejoice, yea, and shall rejoice."
50,1,19,"For I have known that this shall fall out to me for salvation, through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Christ Jesus,"
50,1,20,"according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, and in all freedom, as always, also now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death,"
50,1,21,"for to me to live"
50,1,22,"And if to live in the flesh"
50,1,23,"for I am pressed by the two, having the desire to depart, and to be with Christ, for it is far better,"
50,1,24,"and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account,"
50,1,25,"and of this being persuaded, I have known that I shall remain and continue with you all, to your advancement and joy of the faith,"
50,1,26,"that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence again to you."
50,1,27,"Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct you yourselves, that, whether having come and seen you, whether being absent I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one soul, striving together for the faith of the good news,"
50,1,28,"and not terrified in anything by those opposing, which to them indeed is a token of destruction, and to you of salvation, and that from God;"
50,1,29,"because to you it was granted, on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also on behalf of him to suffer;"
50,1,30,"the same conflict having, such as you saw in me, and now hear of in me."
50,2,1,"If, then, any exhortation"
50,2,2,"fulfil you my joy, that you may mind the same thing -- having the same love -- of one soul -- minding the one thing,"
50,2,3,"nothing in rivalry or vain-glory, but in humility of mind one another counting more excellent than yourselves --"
50,2,4,"each not to your own look you, but each also to the things of others."
50,2,5,"For, let this mind be in you that"
50,2,6,"who, being in the form of God, thought"
50,2,7,"but did empty himself, the form of a servant having taken, in the likeness of men having been made,"
50,2,8,"and in fashion having been found as a man, he humbled himself, having become obedient unto death -- death even of a cross,"
50,2,9,"wherefore, also, God did highly exalt him, and gave to him a name that"
50,2,10,"that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow -- of heavenlies, and earthlies, and what are under the earth --"
50,2,11,"and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ"
50,2,12,"So that, my beloved, as you always obey, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and trembling your own salvation work out,"
50,2,13,"for God it is who is working in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure."
50,2,14,"All things do without murmurings and reasonings,"
50,2,15,"that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God, unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverse, among whom you do appear as luminaries in the world,"
50,2,16,"the word of life holding forth, for rejoicing to me in regard to a day of Christ, that not in vain did I run, nor in vain did I labour;"
50,2,17,"but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and joy with you all,"
50,2,18,"because of this do you also rejoice and joy with me."
50,2,19,"And I hope, in the Lord Jesus, Timotheus to send quickly to you, that I also may be of good spirit, having known the things concerning you,"
50,2,20,"for I have no one like-minded, who sincerely for the things concerning you will care,"
50,2,21,"for the whole seek their own things, not the things of the Christ Jesus,"
50,2,22,"and the proof of him you know, that as a child"
50,2,23,"him, indeed, therefore, I hope to send, when I may see through the things concerning me -- immediately;"
50,2,24,"and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly come."
50,2,25,"And I thought"
50,2,26,"seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness, because you heard that he ailed,"
50,2,27,"for he also ailed nigh to death, but God did deal kindly with him, and not with him only, but also with me, that sorrow upon sorrow I might not have."
50,2,28,"The more eagerly, therefore, I did send him, that having seen him again you may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful;"
50,2,29,"receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and hold such in honour,"
50,2,30,"because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near to death, having hazarded the life that he might fill up your deficiency of service unto me."
50,3,1,"As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord; the same things to write to you to me indeed is not tiresome, and for you"
50,3,2,"look to the dogs, look to the evil-workers, look to the concision;"
50,3,3,"for we are the circumcision, who by the Spirit are serving God, and glorying in Christ Jesus, and in flesh having no trust,"
50,3,4,"though I also have"
50,3,5,"circumcision on the eighth day! of the race of Israel! of the tribe of Benjamin! a Hebrew of Hebrews! according to law a Pharisee!"
50,3,6,"according to zeal persecuting the assembly! according to righteousness that is in law becoming blameless!"
50,3,7,"But what things were to me gains, these I have counted, because of the Christ, loss;"
50,3,8,"yes, indeed, and I count all things to be loss, because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, because of whom of the all things I suffered loss, and do count them to be refuse, that Christ I may gain, and be found in him,"
50,3,9,"not having my righteousness, which"
50,3,10,"to know him, and the power of his rising again, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,"
50,3,11,"if anyhow I may attain to the rising again of the dead."
50,3,12,"Not that I did already obtain, or have been already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by the Christ Jesus;"
50,3,13,"brethren, I do not reckon myself to have laid hold; and one thing -- the things behind indeed forgetting, and to the things before stretching forth --"
50,3,14,"to the mark I pursue for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
50,3,15,"As many, therefore, as"
50,3,16,"but to what we have come -- by the same rule walk, the same thing think;"
50,3,17,"become followers together of me, brethren, and observe those thus walking, according as you have us -- a pattern;"
50,3,18,"for many walk of whom many times I told you -- and now also weeping tell -- the enemies of the cross of the Christ!"
50,3,19,"whose end"
50,3,20,"For our citizenship is in the heavens, whence also a Saviour we await -- the Lord Jesus Christ --"
50,3,21,"who shall transform the body of our humiliation to its becoming conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working of his power, even to subject to himself the all things."
50,4,1,"So then, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand you in the Lord, beloved."
50,4,2,"Euodia I exhort, and Syntyche I exhort, to be of the same mind in the Lord;"
50,4,3,"and I ask also you, genuine yoke-fellow, be assisting those women who in the good news did strive along with me, with Clement also, and the others, my fellow-workers, whose names"
50,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice;"
50,4,5,"let your forbearance be known to all men; the Lord"
50,4,6,"for nothing be anxious, but in everything by prayer, and by supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God;"
50,4,7,"and the peace of God, that is surpassing all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus."
50,4,8,"As to the rest, brethren, as many things as are true, as many as"
50,4,9,"the things that also you did learn, and receive, and hear, and saw in me, those do, and the God of the peace shall be with you."
50,4,10,"And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at length you flourished again in caring for me, for which also you were caring, and lacked opportunity;"
50,4,11,"not that in respect of want I say"
50,4,12,"I have known both to be abased, and I have known to abound; in everything and in all things I have been initiated, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want."
50,4,13,"For all things I have strength, in Christ's strengthening me;"
50,4,14,"but you did well, having communicated with my tribulation;"
50,4,15,"and you have known, even you Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news when I went forth from Macedonia, no assembly did communicate with me in regard to giving and receiving except you only;"
50,4,16,"because also in Thessalonica, both once and again to my need you sent;"
50,4,17,"not that I seek after the gift, but I seek after the fruit that is overflowing to your account;"
50,4,18,"and I have all things, and abound; I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you -- an odour of a sweet smell -- a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God:"
50,4,19,"and my God shall supply all your need, according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus;"
50,4,20,"and to God, even our Father,"
50,4,21,"Salute you every saint in Christ Jesus; there salute you the brethren with me;"
50,4,22,"there salute you all the saints, and specially those of Caesar's house;"
50,4,23,"the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ"
51,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timotheus the brother,"
51,1,2,"to the saints in Colossae, and to the faithful brethren in Christ: Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
51,1,3,"We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying for you,"
51,1,4,"having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love that"
51,1,5,"because of the hope that is laid up for you in the heavens, which you heard of before in the word of the truth of the good news,"
51,1,6,"which is present to you, as also in all the world, and is bearing fruit, as also in you, from the day in which you heard, and knew the grace of God in truth;"
51,1,7,"as you also learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow-servant, who is for you a faithful minister of the Christ,"
51,1,8,"who also did declare to us your love in the Spirit."
51,1,9,"Because of this, we also, from the day in which we heard, do not cease praying for you, and asking that you may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,"
51,1,10,"to your walking worthily of the Lord to all pleasing, in every good work being fruitful, and increasing to the knowledge of God,"
51,1,11,"in all might being made mighty according to the power of His glory, to all endurance and long-suffering with joy."
51,1,12,"Giving thanks to the Father who did make us meet for the participation of the inheritance of the saints in the light,"
51,1,13,"who did rescue us out of the authority of the darkness, and did translate"
51,1,14,"in whom we have the redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of the sins,"
51,1,15,"who is the image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation,"
51,1,16,"because in him were the all things created, those in the heavens, and those upon the earth, those visible, and those invisible, whether thrones, whether lordships, whether principalities, whether authorities; all thing s through him, and for him, have been created,"
51,1,17,"and himself is before all, and the all things in him have consisted."
51,1,18,"And himself is the head of the body -- the assembly -- who is a beginning, a first-born out of the dead, that he might become in all"
51,1,19,"because in him it did please all the fulness to tabernacle,"
51,1,20,"and through him to reconcile the all things to himself -- having made peace through the blood of his cross -- through him, whether the things upon the earth, whether the things in the heavens."
51,1,21,"And you -- once being alienated, and enemies in the mind, in the evil works, yet now did he reconcile,"
51,1,22,"in the body of his flesh through the death, to present you holy, and unblemished, and unblameable before himself,"
51,1,23,"if also you remain in the faith, being founded and settled, and not moved away from the hope of the good news, which you heard, which was preached in all the creation that"
51,1,24,"I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and do fill up the things lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the assembly,"
51,1,25,"of which I -- I did become a minister according to the dispensation of God, that was given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God,"
51,1,26,"the secret that has been hid from the ages and from the generations, but now was manifested to his saints,"
51,1,27,"to whom God did will to make known what"
51,1,28,"whom we proclaim, warning every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,"
51,1,29,"for which also I labour, striving according to his working that is working in me in power."
51,2,1,"For I wish you to know how great a conflict I have for you and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,"
51,2,2,"that their hearts may be comforted, being united in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of the understanding, to the full knowledge of the secret of the God and Father, and of the Christ,"
51,2,3,"in whom are all the treasures of the wisdom and the knowledge hid,"
51,2,4,"and this I say, that no one may beguile you in enticing words,"
51,2,5,"for if even in the flesh I am absent -- yet in the spirit I am with you, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in regard to Christ;"
51,2,6,"as, then, you did receive Christ Jesus the Lord, in him walk you,"
51,2,7,"being rooted and built up in him, and confirmed in the faith, as you were taught -- abounding in it in thanksgiving."
51,2,8,"See that no one shall be carrying you away as spoil through the philosophy and vain deceit, according to the deliverance of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to Christ,"
51,2,9,"because in him does tabernacle all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,"
51,2,10,"and you are in him made full, who is the head of all principality and authority,"
51,2,11,"in whom also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh in the circumcision of the Christ,"
51,2,12,"being buried with him in the baptism, in which also you rose with"
51,2,13,"And you -- being dead in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh -- He made alive together with him, having forgiven you all the trespasses,"
51,2,14,"having blotted out the handwriting in the ordinances that is against us, that was contrary to us, and he has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross;"
51,2,15,"having stripped the principalities and the authorities, he made a shew of them openly -- having triumphed over them in it."
51,2,16,"Let no one, then, judge you in eating or in drinking, or in respect of a feast, or of a new moon, or of sabbaths,"
51,2,17,"which are a shadow of the coming things, and the body"
51,2,18,"let no one beguile you of your prize, delighting in humble-mindedness and"
51,2,19,"and not holding the head, from which all the body -- through the joints and bands gathering supply, and being knit together -- may increase with the increase of God."
51,2,20,"If, then, you did die with the Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as living in the world, are you subject to ordinances?"
51,2,21,"-- you may not touch, nor taste, nor handle --"
51,2,22,"which are all for destruction with the using, after the commands and teachings of men,"
51,2,23,"which are, indeed, having a matter of wisdom in will-worship, and humble-mindedness, and neglecting of body -- not in any honour, unto a satisfying of the flesh."
51,3,1,"If, then, you were raised with the Christ, the things above seek you, where the Christ is, on the right hand of God seated,"
51,3,2,"the things above mind you, not the things upon the earth,"
51,3,3,"for you did die, and your life has been hid with the Christ in God;"
51,3,4,"when the Christ -- our life -- may be manifested, then also we with him shall be manifested in glory."
51,3,5,"Put to death, then, your members that"
51,3,6,"because of which things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience,"
51,3,7,"in which also you -- you did walk once, when you lived in them;"
51,3,8,"but now put off, even you, the whole -- anger, wrath, malice, evil-speaking, filthy talking -- out of your mouth."
51,3,9,"Lie not one to another, having put off the old man with his practices,"
51,3,10,"and having put on the new, which is renewed in regard to knowledge, after the image of Him who did create him;"
51,3,11,"where there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, servant, freeman -- but the all and in all -- Christ."
51,3,12,"Put on, therefore, as choice ones of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humble-mindedness, meekness, long-suffering,"
51,3,13,"forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any one with any one may have a quarrel, as also the Christ did forgive you -- so also you;"
51,3,14,"and above all these things,"
51,3,15,"and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body, and become thankful."
51,3,16,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing each other, in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, in grace singing in your hearts to the Lord;"
51,3,17,"and all, whatever you may do in word or in work,"
51,3,18,"The wives! be subject to your own husbands, as is fit in the Lord;"
51,3,19,"the husbands! love your wives, and be not bitter with them;"
51,3,20,"the children! obey the parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord;"
51,3,21,"the fathers! vex not your children, lest they be discouraged."
51,3,22,"The servants! obey in all things those who are masters according to the flesh, not in eye-service as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God;"
51,3,23,"and all, whatever you may do -- out of soul work -- as to the Lord, and not to men,"
51,3,24,"having known that from the Lord you shall receive the recompense of the inheritance -- for the Lord Christ you serve;"
51,3,25,"and he who is doing unrighteously shall receive what he did unrighteously, and there is no acceptance of persons."
51,4,1,"The masters! that which is righteous and equal to the servants give you, having known that you also have a Master in the heavens."
51,4,2,"In the prayer continue you, watching in it in thanksgiving;"
51,4,3,"praying at the same time also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the secret of the Christ, because of which also I have been bound,"
51,4,4,"that I may manifest it, as it behooveth me to speak;"
51,4,5,"in wisdom walk you toward those without, the time forestalling;"
51,4,6,"your word always in grace -- with salt being seasoned -- to know how it behooveth you to answer each one."
51,4,7,"All the things concerning me make known to you shall Tychicus -- the beloved brother, and faithful minister, and fellow-servant in the Lord --"
51,4,8,"whom I did send unto you for this very thing, that he might know the things concerning you, and might comfort your hearts,"
51,4,9,"with Onesimus the faithful and beloved brother, who is of you; all things to you shall they make known that"
51,4,10,"Salute you does Aristarchus, my fellow-captive, and Marcus, the nephew of Barnabas, (concerning whom you did receive commands -- if he may come unto you receive him,)"
51,4,11,"and Jesus who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these only"
51,4,12,"Salute you does Epaphras, who"
51,4,13,"for I do testify to him, that he has much zeal for you, and those in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis."
51,4,14,"Salute you does Lukas, the beloved physician, and Demas;"
51,4,15,"salute you those in Laodicea -- brethren, and Nymphas, and the assembly in his house;"
51,4,16,"and when the epistle may be read with you, cause that also in the assembly of the Laodiceans it may be read, and the"
51,4,17,"and say to Archippus, 'See to the ministration that you did receive in the Lord, that you may fulfil it.'"
51,4,18,"The salutation by the hand of me, Paul; remember my bonds; the grace"
52,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
52,1,2,"We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,"
52,1,3,"unceasingly remembering of you the work of the faith, and the labour of the love, and the endurance of the hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father,"
52,1,4,"having known, brethren beloved, by God, your election,"
52,1,5,"because our good news did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, even as you have known of what sort we became among you because of you,"
52,1,6,"and you -- you did become imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Spirit,"
52,1,7,"so that you became patterns to all those believing in Macedonia and Achaia,"
52,1,8,"for from you has sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God did go forth, so that we have no need to say anything,"
52,1,9,"for they themselves concerning us do declare what entrance we had unto you, and how you did turn unto God from the idols, to serve a living and true God,"
52,1,10,"and to wait for His Son from the heavens, whom He did raise out of the dead -- Jesus, who is rescuing us from the anger that is coming."
52,2,1,"For yourselves have known, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it did not become vain,"
52,2,2,"but having both suffered before, and having been injuriously treated (as you have known) in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the good news of God in much conflict,"
52,2,3,"for our exhortation"
52,2,4,"but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who is proving our hearts,"
52,2,5,"for at no time did we come with speech of flattery, (as you have known,) nor in a pretext for covetousness, (God"
52,2,6,"nor seeking of men glory, neither from you nor from others, being able to be burdensome, as Christ's apostles."
52,2,7,"But we became gentle in your midst, as a nurse may cherish her own children,"
52,2,8,"so being desirous of you, we are well-pleased to impart to you not only the good news of God, but also our own souls, because beloved you have become to us,"
52,2,9,"for you remember, brethren, our labour and travail, for, night and day working not to be a burden upon any of you, we did preach to you the good news of God;"
52,2,10,"you"
52,2,11,"even as you have known, how each one of you, as a father his own children, we are exhorting you, and comforting, and testifying,"
52,2,12,"for your walking worthily of God, who is calling you to His own reign and glory."
52,2,13,"Because of this also, we -- we do give thanks to God continually, that, having received the word of hearing from us of God, you accepted, not the word of man, but as it is truly, the word of God, who also does work in you who believe;"
52,2,14,"for you became imitators, brethren, of the assemblies of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because such things you suffered, even you, from your own countrymen, as also they from the Jews,"
52,2,15,"who did both put to death the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and did persecute us, and God they are not pleasing, and to all men"
52,2,16,"forbidding us to speak to the nations that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always, but the anger did come upon them -- to the end!"
52,2,17,"And we, brethren, having been taken from you for the space of an hour -- in presence, not in heart -- did hasten the more abundantly to see your face in much desire,"
52,2,18,"therefore we wished to come unto you, (I indeed Paul,) both once and again, and the Adversary did hinder us;"
52,2,19,"for what"
52,2,20,"for you are our glory and joy."
52,3,1,"Therefore no longer forbearing, we thought good to be left in Athens alone,"
52,3,2,"and did send Timothy -- our brother, and a ministrant of God, and our fellow-workman in the good news of the Christ -- to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith,"
52,3,3,"that no one be moved in these tribulations, for yourselves have known that for this we are set,"
52,3,4,"for even when we were with you, we said to you beforehand, that we are about to suffer tribulation, as also it did come to pass, and you have known"
52,3,5,"because of this also, I, no longer forbearing, did send to know your faith, lest he who is tempting did tempt you, and in vain might be our labour."
52,3,6,"And now Timothy having come unto us from you, and having declared good news to us of your faith and love, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring much to see us, as we also"
52,3,7,"because of this we were comforted, brethren, over you, in all our tribulation and necessity, through your faith,"
52,3,8,"because now we live, if you may stand fast in the Lord;"
52,3,9,"for what thanks are we able to recompense to God for you, for all the joy with which we do joy because of you in the presence of our God?"
52,3,10,"night and day exceedingly beseeching, that we might see your face, and perfect the things lacking in your faith."
52,3,11,"And our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you,"
52,3,12,"and you the Lord cause to increase and to abound in the love to one another, and to all, even as we also to you,"
52,3,13,"to the establishing your hearts blameless in sanctification before our God and Father, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints."
52,4,1,"As to the rest, then, brethren, we request you, and call upon you in the Lord Jesus, as you did receive from us how it behooves you to walk and to please God, that you may abound the more,"
52,4,2,"for you have known what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus,"
52,4,3,"for this is the will of God -- your sanctification; that you abstain from the whoredom,"
52,4,4,"that each of you know his own vessel to possess in sanctification and honour,"
52,4,5,"not in the affection of desire, as also the nations that were not knowing God,"
52,4,6,"that no one go beyond and defraud in the matter his brother, because an avenger"
52,4,7,"for God did not call us on uncleanness, but in sanctification;"
52,4,8,"he, therefore, who is despising -- does not despise man, but God, who also did give His Holy Spirit to us."
52,4,9,"And concerning the brotherly love, you have no need of"
52,4,10,"for you do it also to all the brethren who"
52,4,11,"and to study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we did command you,"
52,4,12,"that you may walk becomingly unto those without, and may have lack of nothing."
52,4,13,"And I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, that you may not sorrow, as also the rest who have not hope,"
52,4,14,"for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also God those asleep through Jesus he will bring with him,"
52,4,15,"for this to you we say in the word of the Lord, that we who are living -- who do remain over to the presence of the Lord -- may not precede those asleep,"
52,4,16,"because the Lord himself, in a shout, in the voice of a chief-messenger, and in the trump of God, shall come down from heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise first,"
52,4,17,"then we who are living, who are remaining over, together with them shall be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in air, and so always with the Lord we shall be;"
52,4,18,"so, then, comfort you one another in these words."
52,5,1,"And concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need of my writing to you,"
52,5,2,"for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the Lord as a thief in the night does so come,"
52,5,3,"for when they may say, Peace and surety, then sudden destruction does stand by them, as the travail"
52,5,4,"and you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may catch you as a thief;"
52,5,5,"all you are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of darkness,"
52,5,6,"so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and be sober,"
52,5,7,"for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and those making themselves drunk, by night are drunken,"
52,5,8,"and we, being of the day -- let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet -- a hope of salvation,"
52,5,9,"because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
52,5,10,"who did die for us, that whether we wake -- whether we sleep -- together with him we may live;"
52,5,11,"therefore, comfort you one another, and build you up, one the one, as also you do."
52,5,12,"And we ask you, brethren, to know those labouring among you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you,"
52,5,13,"and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of their work; be at peace among yourselves;"
52,5,14,"and we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the infirm, be patient unto all;"
52,5,15,"see no one evil for evil may render to any one, but always that which is good pursue you, both to one another and to all;"
52,5,16,"always rejoice you;"
52,5,17,"continually pray you;"
52,5,18,"in every thing give thanks, for this"
52,5,19,"The Spirit quench not;"
52,5,20,"prophesyings despise not;"
52,5,21,"all things prove; that which is good hold fast;"
52,5,22,"from all appearance of evil abstain you;"
52,5,23,"and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
52,5,24,"stedfast is He who is calling you, who also will do"
52,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us;"
52,5,26,"salute all the brethren in an holy kiss;"
52,5,27,"I charge you"
52,5,28,"the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ"
53,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
53,1,2,"Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
53,1,3,"We ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, as it is proper, because increase greatly does your faith, and abound does the love of each one of you all, to one another;"
53,1,4,"so that we ourselves do glory in you in the assemblies of God, for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you bear;"
53,1,5,"a token of the righteous judgment of God, for your being counted worthy of the reign of God, for which also you suffer,"
53,1,6,"since"
53,1,7,"and to you who are troubled -- rest with us in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with messengers of his power,"
53,1,8,"in flaming fire, giving vengeance to those not knowing God, and to those not obeying the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
53,1,9,"who shall suffer justice -- destruction age-during -- from the face of the Lord, and from the glory of his strength,"
53,1,10,"when He may come to be glorified in his saints, and to be wondered at in all those believing -- because our testimony was believed among you -- in that day;"
53,1,11,"for which also we do pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of the calling, and may fulfil all the good pleasure of goodness, and the work of the faith in power,"
53,1,12,"that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,1,"And we ask you, brethren, in regard to the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of our gathering together unto him,"
53,2,2,"that you be not quickly shaken in mind, nor be troubled, neither through spirit, neither through word, neither through letters as through us, as that the day of Christ has arrived;"
53,2,3,"let not any one deceive you in any manner, because -- if the falling away may not come first, and the man of sin be revealed -- the son of the destruction,"
53,2,4,"who is opposing and is raising himself up above all called God or worshipped, so that he in the sanctuary of God as God has sat down, showing himself off that he is God --"
53,2,5,"Do you not remember that, being yet with you, these things I said to you?"
53,2,6,"and now, what is keeping down you have known, for his being revealed in his own time,"
53,2,7,"for the secret of the lawlessness does already work, only he who is keeping down now"
53,2,8,"and then shall be revealed the Lawless One, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the manifestation of his presence,"
53,2,9,""
53,2,10,"and in all deceitfulness of the unrighteousness in those perishing, because the love of the truth they did not receive for their being saved,"
53,2,11,"and because of this shall God send to them a working of delusion, for their believing the lie,"
53,2,12,"that they may be judged -- all who did not believe the truth, but were well pleased in the unrighteousness."
53,2,13,"And we -- we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved by the Lord, that God did choose you from the beginning to salvation, in sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth,"
53,2,14,"to which He did call you through our good news, to the acquiring of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
53,2,15,"so, then, brethren, stand you fast, and hold the deliverances that you were taught, whether through word, whether through our letter;"
53,2,16,"and may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father, who did love us, and did give comfort age-during, and good hope in grace,"
53,2,17,"comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work."
53,3,1,"As to the rest, pray you, brethren, concerning us, that the word of the Lord may run and may be glorified, as also with you,"
53,3,2,"and that we may be delivered from the unreasonable and evil men, for the faith"
53,3,3,"and stedfast is the Lord, who shall establish you, and shall guard"
53,3,4,"and we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that the things that we command you both do and will do;"
53,3,5,"and the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to the endurance of the Christ."
53,3,6,"And we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother disorderly walking, and not after the deliverance that you received from us,"
53,3,7,"for yourselves have known how it behooves"
53,3,8,"nor for nought did we eat bread of any one, but in labour and in travail, night and day working, not to be chargeable to any of you;"
53,3,9,"not because we have not authority, but that ourselves a pattern we might give to you, to imitate us;"
53,3,10,"for even when we were with you, this we did command you, that if any one is not willing to work, neither let him eat,"
53,3,11,"for we hear of certain walking among you disorderly, nothing working, but over working,"
53,3,12,"and such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness working, their own bread they may eat;"
53,3,13,"and you, brethren, may you not be weary doing well,"
53,3,14,"and if any one do not obey our word through the letter, this one note you, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed,"
53,3,15,"and as an enemy count"
53,3,16,"and may the Lord of the peace Himself give to you the peace always in every way; the Lord"
53,3,17,"The salutation by the hand of me, Paul, which is a sign in every letter; thus I write;"
53,3,18,"the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ"
54,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to a command of God our Saviour, and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,"
54,1,2,"to Timothy -- genuine child in faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord,"
54,1,3,"according as I did exhort you to remain in Ephesus -- I going on to Macedonia -- that you might charge certain not to teach any other thing,"
54,1,4,"nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that cause questions rather than the building up of God that is in faith: --"
54,1,5,"And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,"
54,1,6,"from which certain, having swerved, did turn aside to vain discourse,"
54,1,7,"willing to be teachers of law, not understanding either the things they say, nor concerning what they asseverate,"
54,1,8,"and we have known that the law"
54,1,9,"having known this, that for a righteous man law is not set, but for lawless and insubordinate persons, ungodly and sinners, impious and profane, parricides and matricides, men-slayers,"
54,1,10,"whoremongers, sodomites, men-stealers, liars, perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that to sound doctrine is adverse,"
54,1,11,"according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted."
54,1,12,"And I give thanks to him who enabled me -- Christ Jesus our Lord -- that he did reckon me stedfast, having put"
54,1,13,"who before was speaking evil, and persecuting, and insulting, but I found kindness, because, being ignorant, I did"
54,1,14,"and exceedingly abound did the grace of our Lord, with faith and love that"
54,1,15,"stedfast"
54,1,16,"but because of this I found kindness, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern of those about to believe on him to life age-during:"
54,1,17,"and to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only wise God,"
54,1,18,"This charge I commit to you, child Timothy, according to the prophesies that went before upon you, that you may war in them the good warfare,"
54,1,19,"having faith and a good conscience, which certain having thrust away, concerning the faith did make shipwreck,"
54,1,20,"of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I did deliver to the Adversary, that they might be instructed not to speak evil."
54,2,1,"I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men:"
54,2,2,"for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity,"
54,2,3,"for this"
54,2,4,"who does will all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth;"
54,2,5,"for one"
54,2,6,"who did give himself a ransom for all -- the testimony in its own times --"
54,2,7,"in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle -- truth I say in Christ, I do not lie -- a teacher of nations, in faith and truth."
54,2,8,"I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning;"
54,2,9,"in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price,"
54,2,10,"but -- which becomes women professing godly piety -- through good works."
54,2,11,"Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,"
54,2,12,"and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness,"
54,2,13,"for Adam was first formed, then Eve,"
54,2,14,"and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came,"
54,2,15,"and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety."
54,3,1,"Stedfast"
54,3,2,"it benefits, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, of one wife a husband, vigilant, sober, decent, a friend of strangers, apt to teach,"
54,3,3,"not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money,"
54,3,4,"his own house leading well, having children in subjection with all gravity,"
54,3,5,"(and if any one his own house"
54,3,6,"not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the devil;"
54,3,7,"and it benefits him also to have a good testimony from those without, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil."
54,3,8,"Ministers -- in like manner grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not given to filthy lucre,"
54,3,9,"having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience,"
54,3,10,"and let these also first be proved, then let them minister, being unblameable."
54,3,11,"Women -- in like manner grave, not false accusers, vigilant, faithful in all things."
54,3,12,"Ministers -- let them be of one wife husbands; the children leading well, and their own houses,"
54,3,13,"for those who did minister well a good step to themselves do acquire, and much boldness in faith that"
54,3,14,"These things I write to you, hoping to come unto you soon,"
54,3,15,"and if I delay, that you may know how it benefits"
54,3,16,"and, confessedly, great is the secret of piety -- God was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory!"
54,4,1,"And the Spirit expressly speaks, that in latter times shall certain fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,"
54,4,2,"in hypocrisy speaking lies, being seared in their own conscience,"
54,4,3,"forbidding to marry -- to abstain from meats that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing and acknowledging the truth,"
54,4,4,"because every creature of God"
54,4,5,"for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession."
54,4,6,"These things placing before the brethren, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of the faith, and of the good teaching, which you did follow after,"
54,4,7,"and the profane and old women's fables reject you, and exercise yourself unto piety,"
54,4,8,"for the bodily exercise is unto little profit, and the piety is to all things profitable, a promise having of the life that now is, and of that which is coming;"
54,4,9,"stedfast"
54,4,10,"for this we both labour and are reproached, because we hope on the living God, who is Saviour of all men -- especially of those believing."
54,4,11,"Charge these things, and teach;"
54,4,12,"let no one despise your youth, but a pattern become you of those believing in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity;"
54,4,13,"till I come, give heed to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching;"
54,4,14,"be not careless of the gift in you, that was given you through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the eldership;"
54,4,15,"of these things be careful; in these things be, that your advancement may be manifest in all things;"
54,4,16,"take heed to yourself, and to the teaching; remain in them, for this thing doing, both yourself you shall save, and those hearing you."
54,5,1,"An aged person you may not rebuke, but be entreating as a father; younger persons as brethren;"
54,5,2,"aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters -- in all purity;"
54,5,3,"honour widows who are really widows;"
54,5,4,"and if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to their own house to show piety, and to give back a recompense to the parents, for this is right and acceptable before God."
54,5,5,"And she who is really a widow and desolate, has hoped upon God, and does remain in the supplications and in the prayers night and day,"
54,5,6,"and she who is given to luxury, living -- has died;"
54,5,7,"and these things charge, that they may be blameless;"
54,5,8,"and if any one for his own -- and especially for those of the household -- does not provide, the faith he has denied, and than an unbeliever he is worse."
54,5,9,"A widow -- let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age, having been a wife of one husband,"
54,5,10,"in good works being testified to: if she brought up children, if she entertained strangers, if saints' feet she washed, if those in tribulation she relieved, if every good work she followed after;"
54,5,11,"and younger widows be refusing, for when they may revel against the Christ, they wish to marry,"
54,5,12,"having judgment, because the first faith they did cast away,"
54,5,13,"and at the same time also, they learn"
54,5,14,"I wish, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children, to be mistress of the house, to give no occasion to the opposer to reviling;"
54,5,15,"for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary."
54,5,16,"If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the assembly be burdened, that those really widows it may relieve."
54,5,17,"The well-leading elders of double honour let them be counted worthy, especially those labouring in word and teaching,"
54,5,18,"for the Writing says, 'An ox treading out you shall not muzzle,' and"
54,5,19,"Against an elder an accusation receive not, except upon two or three witnesses."
54,5,20,"Those sinning, reprove before all, that the others also may have fear;"
54,5,21,"I testify fully, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the choice messengers, that these things you may keep, without forejudging, doing nothing by partiality."
54,5,22,"Be laying hands quickly on no one, nor be having fellowship with sins of others; be keeping yourself pure;"
54,5,23,"no longer be drinking water, but a little wine be using, because of your stomach and of your often infirmities;"
54,5,24,"of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand, leading before to judgment, and certain also they follow after;"
54,5,25,"in like manner also the right works are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be hid."
54,6,1,"As many as are servants under a yoke, their own masters worthy of all honour let them reckon, that the name of God and the teaching may not be evil spoken of;"
54,6,2,"and those having believing masters, let them not slight"
54,6,3,"if any one be teaching otherwise, and do not consent to sound words -- those of our Lord Jesus Christ -- and to the teaching according to piety,"
54,6,4,"he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and word-striving, out of which does come envy, strife, evil-speakings, evil-surmisings,"
54,6,5,"wranglings of men wholly corrupted in mind, and destitute of the truth, supposing the piety to be gain; depart from such;"
54,6,6,"but it is great gain -- the piety with contentment;"
54,6,7,"for nothing did we bring into the world --"
54,6,8,"but having food and raiment -- with these we shall suffice ourselves;"
54,6,9,"and those wishing to be rich, do fall into temptation and a snare, and many desires, foolish and hurtful, that sink men into ruin and destruction,"
54,6,10,"for a root of all the evils is the love of money, which certain longing for did go astray from the faith, and themselves did pierce through with many sorrows;"
54,6,11,"and you, O man of God, these things flee, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness;"
54,6,12,"be striving the good strife of the faith, be laying hold on the life age-during, to which also you wast called, and did profess the right profession before many witnesses."
54,6,13,"I charge you, before God, who is making all things alive, and of Christ Jesus, who did testify before Pontius Pilate the right profession,"
54,6,14,"that you keep the command unspotted, unblameable, till the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
54,6,15,"which in His own times He shall show -- the blessed and only potentate, the King of the kings and Lord of the lords,"
54,6,16,"who only is having immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no one of men did see, nor is able to see, to whom"
54,6,17,"Those rich in the present age charge you not to be high-minded, nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who is giving to us all things richly for enjoyment; --"
54,6,18,"to do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to impart, willing to communicate,"
54,6,19,"treasuring up to themselves a right foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life age-during."
54,6,20,"O Timothy, the thing entrusted guard you, avoiding the profane vain-words and opposition of the falsely-named knowledge,"
54,6,21,"which certain professing -- concerning the faith did swerve; the grace"
55,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, according to a promise of life that"
55,1,2,"to Timothy, beloved child: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord!"
55,1,3,"I am thankful to God, whom I serve from ancestors in a pure conscience, that unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my supplications night and day,"
55,1,4,"desiring greatly to see you, being mindful of your tears, that with joy I may be filled,"
55,1,5,"taking remembrance of the unfeigned"
55,1,6,"For which cause I remind you to stir up"
55,1,7,"for God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind;"
55,1,8,"therefore you may not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but do you suffer evil along with the good news according to the power of God,"
55,1,9,"who did save us, and did call with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, that was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the times of the ages,"
55,1,10,"and was made manifest now through the manifestation of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who indeed did abolish death, and did enlighten life and immortality through the good news,"
55,1,11,"to which I was placed a preacher and an apostle, and a teacher of nations,"
55,1,12,"for which cause also these things I suffer, but I am not ashamed, for I have known in whom I have believed, and have been persuaded that he is able that which I have committed to him to guard -- to that day."
55,1,13,"The pattern"
55,1,14,"the good thing committed guard you through the Holy Spirit that is dwelling in us;"
55,1,15,"you have known this, that they did turn from me -- all those in Asia, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes;"
55,1,16,"may the Lord give kindness to the house of Onesiphorus, because many times he did refresh me, and of my chain was not ashamed,"
55,1,17,"but being in Rome, very diligently he sought me, and found;"
55,1,18,"may the Lord give to him to find kindness from the Lord in that day; and how many things in Ephesus he did minister you do very well know."
55,2,1,"You, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that"
55,2,2,"and the things that you heard from me through many witnesses, these things be committing"
55,2,3,"you, therefore, suffer evil"
55,2,4,"no one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that him who enlisted him he may please;"
55,2,5,"and if also any one may strive, he is not crowned, except he may strive lawfully;"
55,2,6,"the laboring husbandman"
55,2,7,"Consider what things I say, for the Lord will give to you understanding in all things."
55,2,8,"Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news,"
55,2,9,"in which I suffer evil"
55,2,10,"because of this all things do I endure, because of the choice ones, that they also salvation may obtain that"
55,2,11,"Stedfast"
55,2,12,"if we do endure together -- we shall also reign together; if we deny"
55,2,13,"if we are not stedfast"
55,2,14,"These things remind"
55,2,15,"be diligent to present yourself approved to God -- a workman irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of the truth;"
55,2,16,"and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from, for to more impiety they will advance,"
55,2,17,"and their word as a gangrene will have pasture, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus,"
55,2,18,"who concerning the truth did swerve, saying the rising again to have already been, and do overthrow the faith of some;"
55,2,19,"sure, nevertheless, has the foundation of God stood, having this seal, 'The Lord has known those who are His,' and 'Let him depart from unrighteousness -- every one who is naming the name of Christ.'"
55,2,20,"And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour:"
55,2,21,"if, then, any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified and profitable to the master -- to every good work having been prepared,"
55,2,22,"and the youthful lusts flee you, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart;"
55,2,23,"and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding, having known that they beget strife,"
55,2,24,"and a servant of the Lord it benefits not to strive, but to be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil,"
55,2,25,"in meekness instructing those opposing -- if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth,"
55,2,26,"and they may awake out of the devil's snare, having been caught by him at his will."
55,3,1,"And this know you, that in the last days there shall come perilous times,"
55,3,2,"for men"
55,3,3,"without natural affection"
55,3,4,"traitors, heady"
55,3,5,"having a form"
55,3,6,"for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women, laden"
55,3,7,"always learning, and"
55,3,8,"and, even as Jannes and Jambres stood against"
55,3,9,"but they shall not advance any further, for their folly shall be manifest"
55,3,10,"And you -- you have followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering"
55,3,11,"the persecutions, the afflictions, that befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all the Lord did deliver me,"
55,3,12,"and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted,"
55,3,13,"and evil men"
55,3,14,"And you -- be remaining in the things which you did learn and were entrusted"
55,3,15,"and because from a babe"
55,3,16,"every Writing"
55,3,17,"that the man"
55,4,1,"I do fully testify, then, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is about to judge living and dead at his manifestation and his reign --"
55,4,2,"preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season, convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching,"
55,4,3,"for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they will not suffer, but according to their own desires to themselves they shall heap up teachers -- itching in the hearing,"
55,4,4,"and indeed, from the truth the hearing they shall turn away, and to the fables they shall be turned aside."
55,4,5,"And you -- watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of one proclaiming good news; of your ministration make full assurance,"
55,4,6,"for I am already being poured out, and the time of my release has arrived;"
55,4,7,"the good strife I have striven, the course I have finished, the faith I have kept,"
55,4,8,"henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the righteousness that the Lord -- the Righteous Judge -- shall give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all those loving his manifestation."
55,4,9,"Be diligent to come unto me quickly,"
55,4,10,"for Demas forsook me, having loved the present age, and went on to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia,"
55,4,11,"Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken, bring with yourself, for he is profitable to me for ministration"
55,4,12,"and Tychicus I sent to Ephesus;"
55,4,13,"the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring you and the books -- especially the parchments."
55,4,14,"Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil harm; may the Lord repay to him according to his works,"
55,4,15,"of whom also do you beware, for greatly has he stood against our words;"
55,4,16,"in my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook me, (may it not be reckoned to them!)"
55,4,17,"and the Lord stood by me, and did strengthen me, that through me the preaching might be fully assured, and all the nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion,"
55,4,18,"and the Lord shall free me from every evil work, and shall save"
55,4,19,"Salute Prisca and Aquilas, and Onesiphorus' household;"
55,4,20,"Erastus did remain in Corinth, and Trophimus I left in Miletus sick;"
55,4,21,"be diligent to come before winter. Salute you does Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren."
55,4,22,"The Lord Jesus Christ"
56,1,1,"Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that"
56,1,2,"upon hope of life age-during, which God, who does not lie, did promise before times of ages,"
56,1,3,"(and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,"
56,1,4,"to Titus -- true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour!"
56,1,5,"For this cause left I you in Crete, that the things lacking you may arrange, and may set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to you;"
56,1,6,"if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast"
56,1,7,"for it benefits the overseer to be blameless, as God's steward"
56,1,8,"but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled,"
56,1,9,"holding -- according to the teaching -- to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;"
56,1,10,"for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers -- especially they of the circumcision --"
56,1,11,"whose mouth it benefits to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it benefits not, for filthy lucre's sake."
56,1,12,"A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said -- 'Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!'"
56,1,13,"this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,"
56,1,14,"not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;"
56,1,15,"all things, indeed,"
56,1,16,"God they profess to know, and in the works they deny"
56,2,1,"And you -- be speaking what does become the sound teaching;"
56,2,2,"aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;"
56,2,3,"aged women, in like manner, in deportment"
56,2,4,"that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of"
56,2,5,"sober, pure, keepers of"
56,2,6,"The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;"
56,2,7,"concerning all things yourself showing a pattern"
56,2,8,"discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you."
56,2,9,"Servants -- to their own masters"
56,2,10,"not purloining"
56,2,11,"For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,"
56,2,12,"teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,"
56,2,13,"waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,"
56,2,14,"who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;"
56,2,15,"these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise you!"
56,3,1,"Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,"
56,3,2,"of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome -- gentle, showing all meekness to all men,"
56,3,3,"for we were once -- also we -- thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold"
56,3,4,"and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear"
56,3,5,"(not by works that"
56,3,6,"which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,"
56,3,7,"that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during."
56,3,8,"Stedfast"
56,3,9,"and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from -- for they are unprofitable and vain."
56,3,10,"A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,"
56,3,11,"having known that he has been subverted who"
56,3,12,"When I shall send Artemas unto you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined."
56,3,13,"Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,"
56,3,14,"and let them learn -- ours also -- to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful."
56,3,15,"Salute"
57,1,1,"Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,"
57,1,2,"and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in your house:"
57,1,3,"Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
57,1,4,"I give thanks to my God, always making mention of you in my prayers,"
57,1,5,"hearing of your love and faith that you have unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,"
57,1,6,"that the fellowship of your faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that"
57,1,7,"for we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the affections of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother."
57,1,8,"Therefore, having in Christ much boldness to command you that which is fit --"
57,1,9,"because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;"
57,1,10,"I entreat you concerning my child -- whom I did beget in my bonds -- Onesimus,"
57,1,11,"who once was to you unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to you,"
57,1,12,"whom I did send again, and you him (that is, my own affections) receive,"
57,1,13,"whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,"
57,1,14,"and apart from your mind I willed to do nothing, that as of necessity your good deed may not be, but of willingness,"
57,1,15,"for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that age-duringly you may have him,"
57,1,16,"no more as a servant, but above a servant -- a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord!"
57,1,17,"If, then, with me you have fellowship, receive him as me,"
57,1,18,"and if he did hurt to you, or does owe anything, this to me be reckoning;"
57,1,19,"I, Paul did write with my hand, I -- I will repay; that I may not say that also yourself, besides, to me you do owe."
57,1,20,"Yes, brother, may I have profit of you in the Lord; refresh my affections in the Lord;"
57,1,21,"having been confident in your obedience I did write to you, having known that also above what I may say you will do;"
57,1,22,"and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you."
57,1,23,"Salute you does Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,)"
57,1,24,"Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!"
57,1,25,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ"
58,1,1,"In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,"
58,1,2,"in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the ages;"
58,1,3,"who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying of his might -- through himself having made a cleansing of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the highest,"
58,1,4,"having become so much better than the messengers, as he did inherit a more excellent name than they."
58,1,5,"For to which of the messengers said He ever, 'My Son you are -- I to-day have begotten you?' and again, 'I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?'"
58,1,6,"and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world, He says, 'And let them bow before him -- all messengers of God;'"
58,1,7,"and unto the messengers, indeed, He says, 'Who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;'"
58,1,8,"and unto the Son: 'Your throne, O God,"
58,1,9,"you did love righteousness, and did hate lawlessness; because of this did He anoint you -- God, your God -- with oil of gladness above your partners;'"
58,1,10,"and, 'You, at the beginning, Lord, the earth did found, and a work of your hands are the heavens;"
58,1,11,"these shall perish, and You do remain, and all, as a garment, shall become old,"
58,1,12,"and as a mantle You shall roll them together, and they shall be changed, and You are the same, and Your years shall not fail.'"
58,1,13,"And unto which of the messengers said He ever, 'Sit at My right hand, till I may make your enemies your footstool?'"
58,1,14,"are they not all spirits of service -- for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?"
58,2,1,"Because of this it benefits"
58,2,2,"for if the word being spoken through messengers did become stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience did receive a just recompense,"
58,2,3,"how shall we escape, having neglected so great salvation? which a beginning receiving -- to be spoken through the Lord -- by those having heard was confirmed to us,"
58,2,4,"God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders, and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to His will."
58,2,5,"For not to messengers did He subject the coming world, concerning which we speak,"
58,2,6,"and one in a certain place did testify fully, saying, 'What is man, that You are mindful of him, or a son of man, that You do look after him?"
58,2,7,"You did make him some little less than messengers, with glory and honour You did crown him, and did set him over the works of Your hands,"
58,2,8,"all things You did put in subjection under his feet,' for in the subjecting to him the all things, nothing did He leave to him unsubjected, and now not yet do we see the all things subjected to him,"
58,2,9,"and him who was made some little less than messengers we see -- Jesus -- because of the suffering of the death, with glory and honour having been crowned, that by the grace of God for every one he might taste of death."
58,2,10,"For it was becoming to Him, because of whom"
58,2,11,"for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified"
58,2,12,"saying, 'I will declare Your name to my brethren, in the midst of an assembly I will sing praise to You;' and again, 'I will be trusting on Him;'"
58,2,13,"and again, 'Behold I and the children that God did give to me.'"
58,2,14,"Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the same, that through death he might destroy him having the power of death -- that is, the devil --"
58,2,15,"and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death, throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage,"
58,2,16,"for, doubtless, of messengers it does not lay hold, but of seed of Abraham it lays hold,"
58,2,17,"therefore it did behoove him in all things to be made like to the brethren, that he might become a kind and stedfast chief-priest in the things with God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people,"
58,2,18,"for in that he suffered, himself being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted."
58,3,1,"Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,"
58,3,2,"being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,"
58,3,3,"for of more glory than Moses has this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house has he who does build it,"
58,3,4,"for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build"
58,3,5,"and Moses indeed"
58,3,6,"and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast."
58,3,7,"Therefore, (as the Holy Spirit says, 'To-day, if His voice you may hear --"
58,3,8,"you may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness,"
58,3,9,"in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years;"
58,3,10,"therefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My ways;"
58,3,11,"so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- !')"
58,3,12,"See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,"
58,3,13,"but exhort you one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,"
58,3,14,"for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,"
58,3,15,"in its being said, 'To-day, if His voice you may hear, you may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,'"
58,3,16,"for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses;"
58,3,17,"but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?"
58,3,18,"and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe? --"
58,3,19,"and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief."
58,4,1,"We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,"
58,4,2,"for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,"
58,4,3,"for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe, as He said, 'So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- ;' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,"
58,4,4,"for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh"
58,4,5,"and in this"
58,4,6,"since then, it remains for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief --"
58,4,7,"again He does limit a certain day, 'To-day,' (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it has been said, 'To-day, if His voice you may hear, you may not harden your hearts,'"
58,4,8,"for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;"
58,4,9,"there does remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,"
58,4,10,"for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own."
58,4,11,"May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,"
58,4,12,"for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;"
58,4,13,"and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things"
58,4,14,"Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens -- Jesus the Son of God -- may we hold fast the profession,"
58,4,15,"for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathize with our infirmities, but"
58,4,16,"we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace -- for seasonable help."
58,5,1,"For every chief priest -- out of men taken -- in behalf of men is set in things"
58,5,2,"able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray, since himself also is compassed with infirmity;"
58,5,3,"and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins;"
58,5,4,"and no one to himself does take the honour, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron:"
58,5,5,"so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest, but He who spake unto him: 'My Son you are, I to-day have begotten you;'"
58,5,6,"as also in another"
58,5,7,"who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications unto Him who was able to save him from death -- with strong crying and tears -- having offered up, and having been heard in respect to that which he feared,"
58,5,8,"through being a Son, did learn by the things which he suffered -- the obedience,"
58,5,9,"and having been made perfect, he did become to all those obeying him a cause of salvation age-during,"
58,5,10,"having been addressed by God a chief priest, according to the order of Melchisedek,"
58,5,11,"concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard explanation to say, since you have become dull of hearing,"
58,5,12,"for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again you have need that one teach you what"
58,5,13,"for every one who is partaking of milk"
58,5,14,"and of perfect men is the strong food, who because of the use are having the senses exercised, unto the discernment both of good and of evil."
58,6,1,"Therefore, having left the word of the beginning of the Christ, unto the perfection we may advance, not again a foundation laying of reformation from dead works, and of faith on God,"
58,6,2,"of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on also of hands, of rising again also of the dead, and of judgment age-during,"
58,6,3,"and this we will do, if God may permit,"
58,6,4,"for"
58,6,5,"and did taste the good saying of God, the powers also of the coming age,"
58,6,6,"and having fallen away, again to renew"
58,6,7,"For earth, that is drinking in the rain many times coming upon it, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of whom also it is dressed, does partake of blessing from God,"
58,6,8,"and that which is bearing thorns and briers"
58,6,9,"and we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things that are better, and accompanying salvation, though even thus we speak,"
58,6,10,"for God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the labour of the love, that you showed to His name, having ministered to the saints and ministering;"
58,6,11,"and we desire each one of you the same diligence to show, unto the full assurance of the hope unto the end,"
58,6,12,"that you may not become slothful, but followers of those who through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the promises."
58,6,13,"For to Abraham God, having made promise, seeing He was able to swear by no greater, did swear by Himself,"
58,6,14,"saying, 'Blessing indeed I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you;'"
58,6,15,"and so, having patiently endured, he did obtain the promise;"
58,6,16,"for men indeed do swear by the greater, and an end of all controversy to them for confirmation"
58,6,17,"in which God, more abundantly willing to show to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, did interpose by an oath,"
58,6,18,"that through two immutable things, in which"
58,6,19,"which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and entering into that within the vail,"
58,6,20,"whither a forerunner for us did enter -- Jesus, after the order of Melchisedek chief priest having become -- to the age."
58,7,1,"For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,"
58,7,2,"to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, 'King of righteousness,' and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)"
58,7,3,"without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, does remain a priest continually."
58,7,4,"And see how great this one"
58,7,5,"and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;"
58,7,6,"and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he has blessed,"
58,7,7,"and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed --"
58,7,8,"and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there"
58,7,9,"and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, has paid tithes,"
58,7,10,"for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him."
58,7,11,"If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?"
58,7,12,"for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change does come,"
58,7,13,"for he of whom these things are said in another tribe has had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,"
58,7,14,"for"
58,7,15,"And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there does arise another priest,"
58,7,16,"who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,"
58,7,17,"for He does testify -- 'You"
58,7,18,"for a disannulling indeed does come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,"
58,7,19,"(for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God."
58,7,20,"And inasmuch as"
58,7,21,"and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him, 'The Lord sware, and will not repent, You"
58,7,22,"by so much of a better covenant has Jesus become surety,"
58,7,23,"and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining;"
58,7,24,"and he, because of his remaining -- to the age, has the priesthood not transient,"
58,7,25,"whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God -- ever living to make intercession for them."
58,7,26,"For such a chief priest did become us -- kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,"
58,7,27,"who has no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;"
58,7,28,"for the law does appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that"
58,8,1,"And the sum concerning the things spoken of"
58,8,2,"of the holy places a servant, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord did set up, and not man,"
58,8,3,"for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is appointed, whence"
58,8,4,"for if, indeed, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest -- (there being the priests who are offering according to the law, the gifts,"
58,8,5,"who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly things, as Moses has been divinely warned, being about to construct the tabernacle, for 'See (said He) you may make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you in the mount;') --"
58,8,6,"and now he has obtained a more excellent service, how much also of a better covenant is he mediator, which on better promises has been sanctioned,"
58,8,7,"for if that first were faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second."
58,8,8,"For finding fault, He says to them, 'Lo, days come, says the Lord, and I will complete with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, a new covenant,"
58,8,9,"not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day of My taking"
58,8,10,"because this"
58,8,11,"and they shall not teach each his neighbour, and each his brother, saying, Know you the Lord, because they shall all know Me from the small one of them unto the great one of them,"
58,8,12,"because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will remember no more;' --"
58,8,13,"in the saying 'new,' He has made the first old, and what does become obsolete and is old"
58,9,1,"It had, indeed, then (even the first tabernacle) ordinances of service, also a worldly sanctuary,"
58,9,2,"for a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which was both the lamp-stand, and the table, and the bread of the presence -- which is called 'Holy;'"
58,9,3,"and after the second vail a tabernacle that is called 'Holy of holies,'"
58,9,4,"having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid all round about with gold, in which"
58,9,5,"and over it cherubim of the glory, overshadowing the mercy-seat, concerning which we are not now to speak particularly."
58,9,6,"And these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle, indeed, at all times the priests do go in, performing the services,"
58,9,7,"and into the second, once in the year, only the chief priest, not apart from blood, which he does offer for himself and the errors of the people,"
58,9,8,"the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet has been manifested the way of the holy"
58,9,9,"which"
58,9,10,"only in victuals, and drinks, and different baptisms, and fleshly ordinances -- till the time of reformation imposed upon"
58,9,11,"And Christ being come, chief priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands -- that is, not of this creation --"
58,9,12,"neither through blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, did enter in once into the holy places, age-during redemption having obtained;"
58,9,13,"for if the blood of bulls, and goats, and ashes of an heifer, sprinkling those defiled, does sanctify to the purifying of the flesh,"
58,9,14,"how much more shall the blood of the Christ (who through the age-during Spirit did offer himself unblemished to God) purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
58,9,15,"And because of this, of a new covenant he is mediator, that, death having come, for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those called may receive the promise of the age-during inheritance,"
58,9,16,"for where a covenant"
58,9,17,"for a covenant over dead victims"
58,9,18,"whence not even the first apart from blood has been initiated,"
58,9,19,"for every command having been spoken, according to law, by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of the calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he both the book itself and all the people did sprinkle,"
58,9,20,"saying, 'This"
58,9,21,"and both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service with blood in like manner he did sprinkle,"
58,9,22,"and with blood almost all things are purified according to the law, and apart from blood-shedding forgiveness does not come."
58,9,23,""
58,9,24,"for not into holy places made with hands did the Christ enter -- figures of the true -- but into the heaven itself, now to be manifested in the presence of God for us;"
58,9,25,"nor that he may many times offer himself, even as the chief priest does enter into the holy places every year with blood of others;"
58,9,26,"since it had behoved him many times to suffer from the foundation of the world, but now once, at the full end of the ages, for putting away of sin through his sacrifice, he has been manifested;"
58,9,27,"and as it is laid up to men once to die, and after this -- judgment,"
58,9,28,"so also the Christ, once having been offered to bear the sins of many, a second time, apart from a sin-offering, shall appear, to those waiting for him -- to salvation!"
58,10,1,"For the law having a shadow of the coming good things -- not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make perfect those coming near,"
58,10,2,"since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once been purified?"
58,10,3,"but in those"
58,10,4,"for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins."
58,10,5,"Therefore, coming into the world, he said, 'Sacrifice and offering You did not will, and a body You did prepare for me,"
58,10,6,"in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, You did not delight,"
58,10,7,"then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it has been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Your will;'"
58,10,8,"saying above -- 'Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offering You did not will, nor delight in,' -- which according to the law are offered --"
58,10,9,"then he said, 'Lo, I come to do, O God, Your will;' he does take away the first that the second he may establish;"
58,10,10,"in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,"
58,10,11,"and every priest, indeed, has stood daily serving, and the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to take away sins."
58,10,12,"And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered -- to the end, did sit down on the right hand of God, --"
58,10,13,"as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies"
58,10,14,"for by one offering he has perfected to the end those sanctified;"
58,10,15,"and testify to us also does the Holy Spirit, for after that He has said before,"
58,10,16,"'This"
58,10,17,"and 'their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more;'"
58,10,18,"and where forgiveness of these"
58,10,19,"Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus,"
58,10,20,"which way he did initiate for us -- new and living, through the vail, that is, his flesh --"
58,10,21,"and a high priest over the house of God,"
58,10,22,"may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water;"
58,10,23,"may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope, (for faithful"
58,10,24,"and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,"
58,10,25,"not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a custom of certain"
58,10,26,"For we -- willfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth -- no more for sins does there remain a sacrifice,"
58,10,27,"but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers;"
58,10,28,"any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from mercies, by two or three witnesses, does die,"
58,10,29,"of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified, and to the Spirit of the grace did despite?"
58,10,30,"for we have known Him who is saying, 'Vengeance"
58,10,31,"fearful"
58,10,32,"And call to your remembrance the former days, in which, having been enlightened, you did endure much conflict of sufferings,"
58,10,33,"partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so living,"
58,10,34,"for also with my bonds you sympathized, and the robbery of your goods with joy you did receive, knowing that you have in yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring one."
58,10,35,"You may not cast away, then, your boldness, which has great recompense of reward,"
58,10,36,"for of patience you have need, that the will of God having done, you may receive the promise,"
58,10,37,"for yet a very little, He who is coming will come, and will not tarry;"
58,10,38,"and 'the righteous by faith shall live,' and 'if he may draw back, My soul has no pleasure in him,'"
58,10,39,"and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but of those believing to a preserving of soul."
58,11,1,"And faith is of things hoped for a confidence, of matters not seen a conviction,"
58,11,2,"for in this were the elders testified of;"
58,11,3,"by faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by a saying of God, in regard to the things seen not having come out of things appearing;"
58,11,4,"by faith a better sacrifice did Abel offer to God than Cain, through which he was testified to be righteous, God testifying of his gifts, and through it, he being dead, does yet speak."
58,11,5,"By faith Enoch was translated -- not to see death, and was not found, because God did translate him; for before his translation he had been testified to -- that he had pleased God well,"
58,11,6,"and apart from faith it is impossible to please well, for it benefits him who is coming to God to believe that He is, and to those seeking Him He becomes a rewarder."
58,11,7,"By faith Noah, having been divinely warned concerning the things not yet seen, having feared, did prepare an ark to the salvation of his house, through which he did condemn the world, and of the righteousness according to faith he became heir."
58,11,8,"By faith Abraham, being called, did obey, to go forth to the place that he was about to receive for an inheritance, and he went forth, not knowing whither he does go;"
58,11,9,"by faith he did sojourn in the land of the promise as a strange country, in tabernacles having dwelt with Isaac and Jacob, fellow-heirs of the same promise,"
58,11,10,"for he was looking for the city having the foundations, whose artificer and constructor"
58,11,11,"By faith also Sarah herself did receive power to conceive seed, and she bare after the time of life, seeing she did judge Him faithful who did promise;"
58,11,12,"therefore, also from one were begotten -- and that of one who had become dead -- as the stars of the heaven in multitude, and as sand that"
58,11,13,"In faith died all these, not having received the promises, but from afar having seen them, and having been persuaded, and having saluted"
58,11,14,"for those saying such things make manifest that they seek a country;"
58,11,15,"and if, indeed, they had been mindful of that from which they came forth, they might have had an opportunity to return,"
58,11,16,"but now they long for a better, that is, an heavenly, therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for He did prepare for them a city."
58,11,17,"By faith Abraham has offered up Isaac, being tried, and the only begotten he did offer up who did receive the promises,"
58,11,18,"of whom it was said -- 'In Isaac shall a seed be called to you;'"
58,11,19,"reckoning that even out of the dead God is able to raise up, whence also in a figure he did receive"
58,11,20,"By faith, concerning coming things, Isaac did bless Jacob and Esau;"
58,11,21,"by faith Jacob dying -- each of the sons of Joseph did bless, and did bow down upon the top of his staff;"
58,11,22,"by faith, Joseph dying, concerning the outgoing of the sons of Israel did make mention, and concerning his bones did give command."
58,11,23,"By faith Moses, having been born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child comely, and were not afraid of the decree of the king;"
58,11,24,"by faith Moses, having become great, did refuse to be called a son of the daughter of Pharaoh,"
58,11,25,"having chosen rather to be afflicted with the people of God, than to have sin's pleasure for a season,"
58,11,26,"greater wealth having reckoned the reproach of the Christ than the treasures in Egypt, for he did look to the recompense of reward;"
58,11,27,"by faith he left Egypt behind, not having been afraid of the wrath of the king, for, as seeing the Invisible One -- he endured;"
58,11,28,"by faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that He who is destroying the first-born might not touch them."
58,11,29,"By faith they did pass through the Red Sea as through dry land, which the Egyptians having received a trial of, were swallowed up;"
58,11,30,"by faith the walls of Jericho did fall, having been surrounded for seven days;"
58,11,31,"by faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who disbelieved, having received the spies with peace."
58,11,32,"And what shall I yet say? for the time will fail me recounting about Gideon, Barak also, and Samson, and Jephthah, David also, and Samuel, and the prophets,"
58,11,33,"who through faith did subdue kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped mouths of lions,"
58,11,34,"quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouth of the sword, were made powerful out of infirmities, became strong in battle, caused to give way camps of the aliens."
58,11,35,"Women received by a rising again their dead, and others were tortured, not accepting the redemption, that a better rising again they might receive,"
58,11,36,"and others of mockings and scourgings did receive trial, and yet of bonds and imprisonment;"
58,11,37,"they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tried; in the killing of the sword they died; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins -- being destitute, afflicted, injuriously treated,"
58,11,38,"of whom the world was not worthy; in deserts wandering, and"
58,11,39,"and these all, having been testified to through the faith, did not receive the promise,"
58,11,40,"God for us something better having provided, that apart from us they might not be made perfect."
58,12,1,"Therefore, we also having so great a cloud of witnesses set around us, every weight having put off, and the closely besetting sin, through endurance may we run the contest that is set before us,"
58,12,2,"looking to the author and perfecter of faith -- Jesus, who, over-against the joy set before him -- did endure a cross, shame having despised, on the right hand also of the throne of God did sit down;"
58,12,3,"for consider again him who endured such gainsaying from the sinners to himself, that you may not be wearied in your souls -- being faint."
58,12,4,"Not yet unto blood did you resist -- with the sin striving;"
58,12,5,"and you have forgotten the exhortation that does speak fully with you as with sons, 'My son, be not despising chastening of the Lord, nor be faint, being reproved by Him,"
58,12,6,"for whom the Lord does love He does chasten, and He scourges every son whom He receives;'"
58,12,7,"if chastening you endure, as to sons God bears Himself to you, for who is a son whom a father does not chasten?"
58,12,8,"and if you are apart from chastening, of which all have become partakers, then bastards are you, and not sons."
58,12,9,"Then, indeed, fathers of our flesh we have had, chastising"
58,12,10,"for they, indeed, for a few days, according to what seemed good to them, were chastening, but He for profit, to be partakers of His separation;"
58,12,11,"and all chastening for the present, indeed, does not seem to be of joy, but of sorrow, yet afterward the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those exercised through it -- it does yield."
58,12,12,"Therefore, the hanging-down hands and the loosened knees set you up;"
58,12,13,"and straight paths make for your feet, that that which is lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed;"
58,12,14,"peace pursue with all, and the separation, apart from which no one shall see the Lord,"
58,12,15,"looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may give trouble, and through this many may be defiled;"
58,12,16,"lest any one be a fornicator, or a profane person, as Esau, who in exchange for one morsel of food did sell his birthright,"
58,12,17,"for you know that also afterwards, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was disapproved of, for a place of reformation he found not, though with tears having sought it."
58,12,18,"For you came not near to the mount touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,"
58,12,19,"and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of sayings, which those having heard did entreat that a word might not be added to them,"
58,12,20,"for they were not bearing that which is commanded, 'And if a beast may touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or with an arrow shot through,'"
58,12,21,"and, (so terrible was the sight,) Moses said, 'I am fearful exceedingly, and trembling.'"
58,12,22,"But, you came to Mount Zion, and to a city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of messengers,"
58,12,23,"to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven enrolled, and to God the judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men made perfect,"
58,12,24,"and to a mediator of a new covenant -- Jesus, and to blood of sprinkling, speaking better things than that of Abel!"
58,12,25,"See, may you not refuse him who is speaking, for if those did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely speaking -- much less we who do turn away from him who"
58,12,26,"whose voice the earth shook then, and now has he promised, saying, 'Yet once -- I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven;'"
58,12,27,"and this -- 'Yet once' -- does make evident the removal of the things shaken, as of things having been made, that the things not shaken may remain;"
58,12,28,"therefore, a kingdom that cannot be shaken receiving, may we have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly, with reverence and religious fear;"
58,12,29,"for also our God"
58,13,1,"Let brotherly love remain;"
58,13,2,"of the hospitality be not forgetful, for through this unawares certain did entertain messengers;"
58,13,3,"be mindful of those in bonds, as having been bound with them, of those maltreated, as also yourselves being in the body;"
58,13,4,"honourable"
58,13,5,"Without covetousness the behaviour, being content with the things present, for He has said, 'No, I will not leave, no, nor forsake you,'"
58,13,6,"so that we do boldly say, 'The Lord"
58,13,7,"Be mindful of those leading you, who did speak to you the word of God, whose faith -- considering the issue of the behaviour -- be imitating,"
58,13,8,"Jesus Christ yesterday and to-day the same, and to the ages;"
58,13,9,"with teachings manifold and strange be not carried about, for"
58,13,10,"we have an altar, of which to eat they have no authority who the tabernacle are serving,"
58,13,11,"for of those beasts whose blood is brought for sin into the holy places through the chief priest -- of these the bodies are burned without the camp."
58,13,12,"Therefore, also Jesus -- that he might sanctify through"
58,13,13,"now, then, may we go forth unto him without the camp, his reproach bearing;"
58,13,14,"for we have not here an abiding city, but the coming one we seek;"
58,13,15,"through him, then, we may offer up a sacrifice of praise always to God, that is, the fruit of lips, giving thanks to His name;"
58,13,16,"and of doing good, and of fellowship, be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is well-pleased."
58,13,17,"Be obedient to those leading you, and be subject, for these do watch for your souls, as about to give account, that with joy they may do this, and not sighing, for this"
58,13,18,"Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good conscience, in all things willing to behave well,"
58,13,19,"and more abundantly do I call upon"
58,13,20,"And the God of the peace, who did bring up out of the dead the great shepherd of the sheep -- in the blood of an age-during covenant -- our Lord Jesus,"
58,13,21,"make you perfect in every good work to do His will, doing in you that which is well-pleasing before Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom"
58,13,22,"And I entreat you, brethren, suffer the word of the exhortation, for also through few words I have written to you."
58,13,23,"Know you that the brother Timothy is released, with whom, if he may come more shortly, I will see you."
58,13,24,"Salute all those leading you, and all the saints; salute you does those from Italy:"
58,13,25,"the grace"
59,1,1,"James, of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ a servant, to the Twelve Tribes who are in the dispersion: Hail!"
59,1,2,"All joy count"
59,1,3,"knowing that the proof of your faith does work endurance,"
59,1,4,"and let the endurance have a perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire -- in nothing lacking;"
59,1,5,"and if any of you do lack wisdom, let him ask from God, who is giving to all liberally, and not reproaching, and it shall be given to him;"
59,1,6,"and let him ask in faith, nothing doubting, for he who is doubting has been like a wave of the sea, driven by wind and tossed,"
59,1,7,"for let not that man suppose that he shall receive anything from the Lord --"
59,1,8,"a two-souled man"
59,1,9,"And let the brother who is low rejoice in his exaltation,"
59,1,10,"and the rich in his becoming low, because as a flower of grass he shall pass away;"
59,1,11,"for the sun did rise with the burning heat, and did wither the grass, and the flower of it fell, and the grace of its appearance did perish, so also the rich in his way shall fade away!"
59,1,12,"Happy the man who does endure temptation, because, becoming approved, he shall receive the crown of the life, which the Lord did promise to those loving Him."
59,1,13,"Let no one say, being tempted -- 'From God I am tempted,' for God is not tempted of evil, and Himself does tempt no one,"
59,1,14,"and each one is tempted, by his own desires being led away and enticed,"
59,1,15,"afterward the desire having conceived, does give birth to sin, and the sin having been perfected, does bring forth death."
59,1,16,"Be not led astray, my brethren beloved;"
59,1,17,"every good giving, and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the lights, with whom is no variation, or shadow of turning;"
59,1,18,"having counselled, He did beget us with a word of truth, for our being a certain first-fruit of His creatures."
59,1,19,"So then, my brethren beloved, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger,"
59,1,20,"for the wrath of a man the righteousness of God does not work;"
59,1,21,"wherefore having put aside all filthiness and superabundance of evil, in meekness be receiving the engrafted word, that is able to save your souls;"
59,1,22,"and become you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves,"
59,1,23,"because, if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this one has been like to a man viewing his natural face in a mirror,"
59,1,24,"for he did view himself, and has gone away, and immediately he did forget of what kind he was;"
59,1,25,"and he who did look into the perfect law -- that of liberty, and did continue there, this one -- not a forgetful hearer becoming, but a doer of work -- this one shall be happy in his doing."
59,1,26,"If any one does think to be religious among you, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, of this one vain"
59,1,27,"religion pure and undefiled with the God and Father is this, to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation -- unspotted to keep himself from the world."
59,2,1,"My brethren, hold not, in respect of persons, the faith of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
59,2,2,"for if there may come into your synagogue a man with gold ring, in gay raiment, and there may come in also a poor man in vile raiment,"
59,2,3,"and you may look upon him bearing the gay raiment, and may say to him, 'You -- sit you here well,' and to the poor man may say, 'You -- stand you there, or, Sit you here under my footstool,' --"
59,2,4,"you did not judge fully in yourselves, and did become ill-reasoning judges."
59,2,5,"Hearken, my brethren beloved, did not God choose the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the reign that He promised to those loving Him?"
59,2,6,"and you did dishonour the poor one; do not the rich oppress you and themselves draw you to judgment-seats;"
59,2,7,"do they not themselves speak evil of the good name that was called upon you?"
59,2,8,"If, indeed, royal law you complete, according to the Writing, 'You shall love thy neighbour as thyself,' -- you do well;"
59,2,9,"and if you accept persons, sin you do work, being convicted by the law as transgressors;"
59,2,10,"for whoever the whole law shall keep, and shall stumble in one"
59,2,11,"for He who is saying, 'You may not commit adultery,' said also, 'You may do no murder;' and if you shall not commit adultery, and shall commit murder, you have become a transgressor of law;"
59,2,12,"so speak you and so do, as about by a law of liberty to be judged,"
59,2,13,"for the judgment without kindness"
59,2,14,"What"
59,2,15,"and if a brother or sister may be naked, and may be destitute of the daily food,"
59,2,16,"and any one of you may say to them, 'Depart you in peace, be warmed, and be filled,' and may not give to them the things needful for the body, what"
59,2,17,"so also the faith, if it may not have works, is dead by itself."
59,2,18,"But say may some one, You have faith, and I have works, show me thy faith out of thy works, and I will show you out of my works my faith:"
59,2,19,"you -- you do believe that God is one; you do well, and the demons believe, and they shudder!"
59,2,20,"And do you wish to know, O vain man, that the faith apart from the works is dead?"
59,2,21,"Abraham our father -- was not he declared righteous out of works, having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar?"
59,2,22,"do you see that the faith was working with his works, and out of the works the faith was perfected?"
59,2,23,"and fulfilled was the Writing that is saying, 'And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;' and, 'Friend of God' he was called."
59,2,24,"You see, then, that out of works is man declared righteous, and not out of faith only;"
59,2,25,"and in like manner also Rahab the harlot -- was she not out of works declared righteous, having received the messengers, and by another way having sent forth?"
59,2,26,"for as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also the faith apart from the works is dead."
59,3,1,"Many teachers become not, my brethren, having known that greater judgment we shall receive,"
59,3,2,"for we all make many stumbles; if any one in word does not stumble, this one"
59,3,3,"lo, the bits we put into the mouths of the horses for their obeying us, and their whole body we turn about;"
59,3,4,"lo, also the ships, being so great, and by fierce winds being driven, are led about by a very small helm, whithersoever the impulse of the helmsman does counsel,"
59,3,5,"so also the tongue is a little member, and does boast greatly; lo, a little fire how much wood it does kindle!"
59,3,6,"and the tongue"
59,3,7,"For every nature, both of beasts and of fowls, both of creeping things and things of the sea, is subdued, and has been subdued, by the human nature,"
59,3,8,"and the tongue no one of men is able to subdue,"
59,3,9,"with it we do bless the God and Father, and with it we do curse the men made according to the similitude of God;"
59,3,10,"out of the same mouth does come forth blessing and cursing; it does not need, my brethren, these things so to happen;"
59,3,11,"does the fountain out of the same opening pour forth the sweet and the bitter?"
59,3,12,"is a fig-tree able, my brethren, olives to make? or a vine figs? so no fountain salt and sweet water"
59,3,13,"Who"
59,3,14,"and if bitter zeal you have, and rivalry in your heart, glory not, nor lie against the truth;"
59,3,15,"this wisdom is not descending from above, but earthly, physical, demon-like,"
59,3,16,"for where zeal and rivalry"
59,3,17,"and the wisdom from above, first, indeed, is pure, then peaceable, gentle, easily entreated, full of kindness and good fruits, uncontentious, and unhypocritical: --"
59,3,18,"and the fruit of the righteousness in peace is sown to those making peace."
59,4,1,"Whence"
59,4,2,"you desire, and you have not; you murder, and are zealous, and are not able to attain; you fight and war, and you have not, because of your not asking;"
59,4,3,"you ask, and you receive not, because evilly you ask, that in your pleasures you may spend"
59,4,4,"Adulterers and adulteresses! have you not known that friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever, then, may counsel to be a friend of the world, an enemy of God he is set."
59,4,5,"Do you think that emptily the Writing says, 'To envy earnestly desires the spirit that did dwell in us,'"
59,4,6,"and greater grace he does give, wherefore he says, 'God against proud ones does set Himself up, and to lowly ones He does give grace?'"
59,4,7,"be subject, then, to God; stand up against the devil, and he will flee from you;"
59,4,8,"draw near to God, and He will draw near to you; cleanse hands, you sinners! and purify hearts, you two-souled!"
59,4,9,"be exceeding afflicted, and mourn, and weep, let your laughter to mourning be turned, and the joy to heaviness;"
59,4,10,"be made low before the Lord, and He shall exalt you."
59,4,11,"Speak not one against another, brethren; he who is speaking against a brother, and is judging his brother, does speak against law, and does judge law, and if law you do judge, you are not a doer of law but a judge;"
59,4,12,"one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; you -- who are you that do judge the other?"
59,4,13,"Go, now, you who are saying, 'To-day and to-morrow we will go on to such a city, and will pass there one year, and traffic, and make gain;'"
59,4,14,"who do not know the thing of the morrow; for what is your life? for it is a vapour that is appearing for a little, and then is vanishing;"
59,4,15,"instead of your saying, 'If the Lord may will, we shall live, and do this or that;'"
59,4,16,"and now you glory in your pride; all such glorying is evil;"
59,4,17,"to him, then, knowing to do good, and not doing, sin it is to him."
59,5,1,"Go, now, you rich! weep, howling over your miseries that are coming upon"
59,5,2,"your riches have rotted, and your garments have become moth-eaten;"
59,5,3,"your gold and silver have rotted, and the rust of them for a testimony shall be to you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. You made treasure in the last days!"
59,5,4,"lo, the reward of the workmen, of those who in-gathered your fields, which has been fraudulently kept back by you -- does cry out, and the exclamations of those who did reap into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth have entered;"
59,5,5,"you did live in luxury upon the earth, and were wanton; you did nourish your hearts, as in a day of slaughter;"
59,5,6,"you did condemn -- you did murder the righteous one, he does not resist you."
59,5,7,"Be patient, then, brethren, till the presence of the Lord; lo, the husbandman does expect the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it, till he may receive rain -- early and latter;"
59,5,8,"be patient, you also; establish your hearts, because the presence of the Lord has drawn near;"
59,5,9,"murmur not against one another, brethren, that you may not be condemned; lo, the Judge before the door has stood."
59,5,10,"An example take you of the suffering of evil, my brethren, and of the patience, the prophets who did speak in the name of the Lord;"
59,5,11,"lo, we call happy those who are enduring; the endurance of Job you heard of, and the end of the Lord you have seen, that very compassionate is the Lord, and pitying."
59,5,12,"And before all things, my brethren, do not swear, neither by the heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath, and let your Yes be Yes, and the No, No; that under judgment you may not fall."
59,5,13,"Does any one suffer evil among you? let him pray; is any of good cheer? let him sing psalms;"
59,5,14,"is any infirm among you? let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil, in the name of the Lord,"
59,5,15,"and the prayer of the faith shall save the distressed one, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if sins he may have committed, they shall be forgiven to him."
59,5,16,"Be confessing to one another the trespasses, and be praying for one another, that you may be healed; very strong is a working supplication of a righteous man;"
59,5,17,"Elijah was a man like affected as we, and with prayer he did pray -- not to rain, and it did not rain upon the land three years and six months;"
59,5,18,"and again he did pray, and the heaven did give rain, and the land did bring forth her fruit."
59,5,19,"Brethren, if any among you may go astray from the truth, and any one may turn him back,"
59,5,20,"let him know that he who did turn back a sinner from the straying of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins."
60,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the choice sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
60,1,2,"according to a foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied!"
60,1,3,"Blessed"
60,1,4,"to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and unfading, reserved in the heavens for you,"
60,1,5,"who, in the power of God are being guarded, through faith, unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time,"
60,1,6,"in which you are glad, a little now, if it be necessary, being made to sorrow in manifold trials,"
60,1,7,"that the proof of your faith -- much more precious than of gold that is perishing, and through fire being approved -- may be found to praise, and honour, and glory, in the revelation of Jesus Christ,"
60,1,8,"whom, not having seen, you love, in whom, now not seeing and believing, you are glad with joy unspeakable and glorified,"
60,1,9,"receiving the end of your faith -- salvation of souls;"
60,1,10,"concerning which salvation seek out and search out did prophets who concerning the grace toward you did prophecy,"
60,1,11,"searching in regard to what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ that was in them was manifesting, testifying beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory after these,"
60,1,12,"to whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they were ministering these, which now were told to you (through those who did proclaim good news to you,) in the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, to which things messengers do desire to bend looking."
60,1,13,"Therefore having girded up the loins of your mind, being sober, hope perfectly upon the grace that is being brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ,"
60,1,14,"as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves to the former desires in your ignorance,"
60,1,15,"but according as He who did call you"
60,1,16,"because it has been written, 'Become you holy, because I am holy;'"
60,1,17,"and if on the Father you do call, who without acceptance of persons is judging according to the work of each, in fear the time of your sojourn pass you,"
60,1,18,"having known that, not with corruptible things -- silver or gold -- were you redeemed from your foolish behaviour delivered by fathers,"
60,1,19,"but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and unspotted -- Christ's --"
60,1,20,"foreknown, indeed, before the foundation of the world, and manifested in the last times because of you,"
60,1,21,"who through him do believe in God, who did raise out of the dead, and glory to him did give, so that your faith and hope may be in God."
60,1,22,"Your souls having purified in the obedience of the truth through the Spirit to brotherly love unfeigned, out of a pure heart one another love you earnestly,"
60,1,23,"being begotten again, not out of seed corruptible, but incorruptible, through a word of God -- living and remaining -- to the age;"
60,1,24,"because all flesh"
60,1,25,"and the saying of the Lord does remain -- to the age; and this is the saying that was proclaimed good news to you."
60,2,1,"Having put aside, then, all evil, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil speakings,"
60,2,2,"as new-born babes the word's pure milk desire you, that in it you may grow,"
60,2,3,"if so be you did taste that the Lord"
60,2,4,"to whom coming -- a living stone -- by men, indeed, having been disapproved of, but with God choice, precious,"
60,2,5,"and you yourselves, as living stones, are built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
60,2,6,"Therefore, also, it is contained in the Writing: 'Lo, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, choice, precious, and he who is believing on him may not be put to shame;'"
60,2,7,"to you, then, who are believing"
60,2,8,"and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence -- who are stumbling at the word, being unbelieving, -- to which also they were set;"
60,2,9,"and you"
60,2,10,"who"
60,2,11,"Beloved, I call upon"
60,2,12,"having your behaviour among the nations right, that in that which they speak against you as evil-doers, of the good works having beheld, they may glorify God in a day of inspection."
60,2,13,"Be subject, then, to every human creation, because of the Lord, whether to a king, as the highest,"
60,2,14,"whether to governors, as to those sent through him, for punishment, indeed, of evil-doers, and a praise of those doing good;"
60,2,15,"because, so is the will of God, doing good, to put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men;"
60,2,16,"as free, and not having the freedom as the cloak of the evil, but as servants of God;"
60,2,17,"to all give you honour; the brotherhood love you; God fear you; the king honour you."
60,2,18,"The domestics! be subjecting yourselves in all fear to the masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the cross;"
60,2,19,"for this"
60,2,20,"for what renown"
60,2,21,"for to this you were called, because Christ also did suffer for you, leaving to you an example, that you may follow his steps,"
60,2,22,"who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in his mouth,"
60,2,23,"who being reviled -- was not reviling again, suffering -- was not threatening, and was committing himself to Him who is judging righteously,"
60,2,24,"who our sins himself did bear in his body, upon the tree, that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may live; by whose stripes you were healed,"
60,2,25,"for you were as sheep going astray, but you turned back now to the shepherd and overseer of your souls."
60,3,1,"In like manner, the wives, be you subject to your own husbands, that even if certain are disobedient to the word, through the conversation of the wives, without the word, they may be won,"
60,3,2,"having beheld your pure behaviour in fear,"
60,3,3,"whose adorning -- let it not be that which is outward, of plaiting of hair, and of putting around of things of gold, or of putting on of garments,"
60,3,4,"but -- the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible thing of the meek and quiet spirit, which is, before God, of great price,"
60,3,5,"for thus once also the holy women who did hope on God, were adorning themselves, being subject to their own husbands,"
60,3,6,"as Sarah was obedient to Abraham, calling him 'sir,' of whom you did become daughters, doing good, and not fearing any terror."
60,3,7,"The husbands, in like manner, dwelling with"
60,3,8,"And finally, being all of one mind, having fellow-feeling, loving as brethren, compassionate, courteous,"
60,3,9,"not giving back evil for evil, or railing for railing, and on the contrary, blessing, having known that to this you were called, that a blessing you may inherit;"
60,3,10,"for 'he who is willing to love life, and to see good days, let him guard his tongue from evil, and his lips -- not to speak guile;"
60,3,11,"let him turn aside from evil, and do good, let him seek peace and pursue it;"
60,3,12,"because the eyes of the Lord"
60,3,13,"and who"
60,3,14,"but if you also should suffer because of righteousness, happy"
60,3,15,"and the Lord God sanctify in your hearts. And"
60,3,16,"having a good conscience, that in that in which they speak against you as evil-doers, they may be ashamed who are traducing your good behaviour in Christ;"
60,3,17,"for"
60,3,18,"because also Christ once for sin did suffer -- righteous for unrighteous -- that he might lead us to God, having been put to death indeed, in the flesh, and having been made alive in the spirit,"
60,3,19,"in which also to the spirits in prison having gone he did preach,"
60,3,20,"who sometime disbelieved, when once the long-suffering of God did wait, in days of Noah -- an ark being preparing -- in which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water;"
60,3,21,"also to which an antitype does now save us -- baptism, (not a putting away of the filth of flesh, but the question of a good conscience in regard to God,) through the rising again of Jesus Christ,"
60,3,22,"who is at the right hand of God, having gone on to heaven -- messengers, and authorities, and powers, having been subjected to him."
60,4,1,"Christ, then, having suffered for us in the flesh, you also with the same mind arm yourselves, because he who did suffer in the flesh has done with sin,"
60,4,2,"no more in the desires of men, but in the will of God, to live the rest of the time in the flesh;"
60,4,3,"for sufficient to us"
60,4,4,"in which they think it strange -- your not running with them to the same excess of dissoluteness, speaking evil,"
60,4,5,"who shall give an account to Him who is ready to judge living and dead,"
60,4,6,"for this also to dead men was good news proclaimed, that they may be judged, indeed, according to men in the flesh, and may live according to God in the spirit."
60,4,7,"And of all things the end has come near; be sober-minded, then, and watch unto the prayers,"
60,4,8,"and, before all things, to one another having the earnest love, because the love shall cover a multitude of sins;"
60,4,9,"hospitable to one another, without murmuring;"
60,4,10,"each, according as he received a gift, to one another ministering it, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;"
60,4,11,"if any one does speak -- 'as oracles of God;' if any one does minister -- 'as of the ability which God does supply;' that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power -- to the ages of the ages. Amen."
60,4,12,"Beloved, think it not strange at the fiery suffering among you that is coming to try you, as if a strange thing were happening to you,"
60,4,13,"but, according as you have fellowship with the sufferings of the Christ, rejoice you, that also in the revelation of his glory you may rejoice -- exulting;"
60,4,14,"if you be reproached in the name of Christ -- happy"
60,4,15,"for let none of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or evil-doer, or as an inspector into other men's matters;"
60,4,16,"and if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; and let him glorify God in this respect;"
60,4,17,"because it is the time of the beginning of the judgment from the house of God, and if first from us, what the end of those disobedient to the good news of God?"
60,4,18,"And if the righteous man is scarcely saved, the ungodly and sinner -- where shall he appear?"
60,4,19,"so that also those suffering according to the will of god, as to a stedfast Creator, let them commit their own souls in good doing."
60,5,1,"Elders who"
60,5,2,"feed the flock of God that"
60,5,3,"neither as exercising lordship over the heritages, but patterns becoming of the flock,"
60,5,4,"and at the manifestation of the chief Shepherd, you shall receive the unfading crown of glory."
60,5,5,"In like manner, you younger, be subject to elders, and all to one another subjecting yourselves; with humble-mindedness clothe yourselves, because God the proud does resist, but to the humble He does give grace;"
60,5,6,"be humbled, then, under the powerful hand of God, that you He may exalt in good time,"
60,5,7,"all your care having cast upon Him, because He cares for you."
60,5,8,"Be sober, vigilant, because your opponent the devil, as a roaring lion, does walk about, seeking whom he may swallow up,"
60,5,9,"whom resist, stedfast in the faith, having known the same sufferings to your brotherhood in the world to be accomplished."
60,5,10,"And the God of all grace, who did call you to His age-during glory in Christ Jesus, having suffered a little, Himself make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle"
60,5,11,"to Him"
60,5,12,"Through Silvanus, to you the faithful brother, as I reckon, through few"
60,5,13,"Salute you does the"
60,5,14,"Salute you one another in a kiss of love; peace to you all who"
61,1,1,"Simeon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who did obtain a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:"
61,1,2,"Grace to you, and peace be multiplied in the acknowledgement of God and of Jesus our Lord!"
61,1,3,"As all things to us His divine power (the things pertaining unto life and piety) has given, through the acknowledgement of him who did call us through glory and worthiness,"
61,1,4,"through which to us the most great and precious promises have been given, that through these you may become partakers of a divine nature, having escaped from the corruption in the world in desires."
61,1,5,"And this same also -- all diligence having brought in besides, superadd in your faith the worthiness, and in the worthiness the knowledge,"
61,1,6,"and in the knowledge the temperance, and in the temperance the endurance, and in the endurance the piety,"
61,1,7,"and in the piety the brotherly kindness, and in the brotherly kindness the love;"
61,1,8,"for these things being to you and abounding, do make"
61,1,9,"for he with whom these things are not present is blind, dim-sighted, having become forgetful of the cleansing of his old sins;"
61,1,10,"therefore, the rather, brethren, be diligent to make stedfast your calling and choice, for these things doing, you may never stumble,"
61,1,11,"for so, richly shall be superadded to you the entrance into the age-during reign of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
61,1,12,"Therefore, I will not be careless always to remind you concerning these things, though, having known them, and having been established in the present truth,"
61,1,13,"and I think right, so long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up in reminding"
61,1,14,"having known that soon is the laying aside of my tabernacle, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ did show to me,"
61,1,15,"and I will be diligent that also at every time you have, after my outgoing, power to make to yourselves the remembrance of these things."
61,1,16,"For, skilfully devised fables not having followed out, we did make known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but eye-witnesses having become of his majesty --"
61,1,17,"for having received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being borne to him by the excellent glory: 'This is My Son -- the beloved, in whom I was well pleased;'"
61,1,18,"and this voice we -- we did hear, out of heaven borne, being with him in the holy mount."
61,1,19,"And we have more firm the prophetic word, to which we do well giving heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, till day may dawn, and a morning star may arise -- in your hearts;"
61,1,20,"this first knowing, that no prophecy of the Writing does come of private exposition,"
61,1,21,"for not by will of man did ever prophecy come, but by the Holy Spirit borne on holy men of God spake."
61,2,1,"And there did come also false prophets among the people, as also among you there shall be false teachers, who shall bring in besides destructive sects, and the Master who bought them denying, bringing to themselves quick destruction,"
61,2,2,"and many shall follow out their destructive ways, because of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of,"
61,2,3,"and in covetousness, with molded words, of you they shall make merchandise, whose judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber."
61,2,4,"For if God messengers who sinned did not spare, but with chains of thick gloom, having cast"
61,2,5,"and the old world did not spare, but the eighth person, Noah, of righteousness a preacher, did keep, a flood on the world of the impious having brought,"
61,2,6,"and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah having turned to ashes, with an overthrow did condemn, an example to those about to be impious having set"
61,2,7,"and righteous Lot, worn down by the conduct in lasciviousness of the impious, He did rescue,"
61,2,8,"for in seeing and hearing, the righteous man, dwelling among them, day by day the righteous soul with unlawful works was harassing."
61,2,9,"The Lord has known to rescue pious ones out of temptation, and unrighteous ones to a day of judgment, being punished, to keep,"
61,2,10,"and chiefly those going behind the flesh in desire of uncleanness, and lordship despising; presumptuous, self-complacent, dignities they are not afraid to speak evil of,"
61,2,11,"whereas messengers, in strength and power being greater, do not bear against them before the Lord an evil speaking judgment;"
61,2,12,"and these, as irrational natural beasts, made to be caught and destroyed -- in what things they are ignorant of, speaking evil -- in their destruction shall be destroyed,"
61,2,13,"about to receive a reward of unrighteousness, pleasures counting the luxury in the day, spots and blemishes, luxuriating in their deceits, feasting with you,"
61,2,14,"having eyes full of adultery, and unable to cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having an heart exercised in covetousnesses, children of a curse,"
61,2,15,"having forsaken a right way, they did go astray, having followed in the way of Balaam the"
61,2,16,"and had a rebuke of his own iniquity -- a dumb ass, in man's voice having spoken, did forbid the madness of the prophet."
61,2,17,"These are wells without water, and clouds by a tempest driven, to whom the thick gloom of the darkness to the age has been kept;"
61,2,18,"for overswellings of vanity speaking, they do entice in desires of the flesh -- lasciviousnesses, those who had truly escaped from those conducting themselves in error,"
61,2,19,"liberty to them promising, themselves being servants of the corruption, for by whom any one has been overcome, to this one also he has been brought to servitude,"
61,2,20,"for, if having escaped from the pollutions of the world, in the acknowledging of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and by these again being entangled, they have been overcome, become to them has the last things worse than the first,"
61,2,21,"for it were better to them not to have acknowledged the way of the righteousness, than having acknowledged"
61,2,22,"and happened to them has that of the true similitude; 'A dog did turn back upon his own vomit,' and, 'A sow having bathed herself -- to rolling in mire.'"
61,3,1,"This, now, beloved, a second letter to you I write, in both which I stir up your pure mind in reminding"
61,3,2,"to be mindful of the sayings said before by the holy prophets, and of the command of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour,"
61,3,3,"this first knowing, that there shall come in the latter end of the days scoffers, according to their own desires going on,"
61,3,4,"and saying, 'Where is the promise of his presence? for since the fathers did fall asleep, all things so remain from the beginning of the creation;'"
61,3,5,"for this is unobserved by them willingly, that the heavens were of old, and the earth out of water and through water standing together by the word of God,"
61,3,6,"through which the then world, by water having been deluged, was destroyed;"
61,3,7,"and the present heavens and the earth, by the same word are treasured, for fire being kept to a day of judgment and destruction of the impious men."
61,3,8,"And this one thing let not be unobserved by you, beloved, that one day with the Lord"
61,3,9,"the Lord is not slow in regard to the promise, as certain count slowness, but is long-suffering to us, not counselling any to be lost but all to pass on to reformation,"
61,3,10,"and it will come -- the day of the Lord -- as a thief in the night, in which the heavens with a rushing noise will pass away, and the elements with burning heat be dissolved, and earth and the works in it shall be burnt up."
61,3,11,"All these, then, being dissolved, what kind of persons does it behoove you to be in holy behaviors and pious acts?"
61,3,12,"waiting for and hasting to the presence of the day of God, by which the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements with burning heat shall melt;"
61,3,13,"and for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise we do wait, in which righteousness does dwell;"
61,3,14,"therefore, beloved, these things waiting for, be diligent, spotless and unblameable, by Him to be found in peace,"
61,3,15,"and the long-suffering of our Lord count you salvation, according as also our beloved brother Paul -- according to the wisdom given to him -- did write to you,"
61,3,16,"as also in all the epistles, speaking in them concerning these things, among which things are certain hard to be understood, which the untaught and unstable do wrest, as also the other Writings, unto their own destruction."
61,3,17,"You, then, beloved, knowing before, take heed, lest, together with the error of the impious being led away, you may fall from your own stedfastness,"
61,3,18,"and increase you in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; to him"
62,1,1,"That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we did behold, and our hands did handle, concerning the Word of the Life --"
62,1,2,"and the Life was manifested, and we have seen, and do testify, and declare to you the Life, the Age-during, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us --"
62,1,3,"that which we have seen and heard declare we to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship"
62,1,4,"and these things we write to you that your joy may be full."
62,1,5,"And this is the message that we have heard from Him, and announce to you, that God is light, and darkness in Him is not at all;"
62,1,6,"if we may say -- 'we have fellowship with Him,' and in the darkness may walk -- we lie, and do not the truth;"
62,1,7,"and if in the light we may walk, as He is in the light -- we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son does cleanse us from every sin;"
62,1,8,"if we may say -- 'we have not sin,' ourselves we lead astray, and the truth is not in us;"
62,1,9,"if we may confess our sins, steadfast He is and righteous that He may forgive us the sins, and may cleanse us from every unrighteousness;"
62,1,10,"if we may say -- 'we have not sinned,' a liar we make Him, and His word is not in us."
62,2,1,"My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin: and if any one may sin, an advocate we have with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one,"
62,2,2,"and he -- he is a propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world,"
62,2,3,"and in this we know that we have known him, if his commands we may keep;"
62,2,4,"he who is saying, 'I have known him,' and his command is not keeping, a liar he is, and in him the truth is not;"
62,2,5,"and whoever may keep his word, truly in him the love of God has been perfected; in this we know that in him we are."
62,2,6,"He who is saying in him he does remain, ought according as he walked also himself so to walk."
62,2,7,"Brethren, a new command I write not to you, but an old command, that you had from the beginning -- the old command is the word that you heard from the beginning;"
62,2,8,"again, a new command I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness does pass away, and the true light does now shine;"
62,2,9,"he who is saying, in the light he is, and his brother is hating, in the darkness he is till now;"
62,2,10,"he who is loving his brother, in the light he does remain, and a stumbling-block in him there is not;"
62,2,11,"and he who is hating his brother, in the darkness he is, and in the darkness he does walk, and he has not known whither he does go, because the darkness did blind his eyes."
62,2,12,"I write to you, little children, because the sins have been forgiven you through his name;"
62,2,13,"I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who"
62,2,14,"I did write to you, fathers, because you have known him who"
62,2,15,"Love not you the world, nor the things in the world; if any one does love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,"
62,2,16,"because all that"
62,2,17,"and the world does pass away, and the desire of it, and he who is doing the will of God, he does remain -- to the age."
62,2,18,"Little youths, it is the last hour; and even as you heard that the antichrist does come, even now antichrists have become many -- whence we know that it is the last hour;"
62,2,19,"out of us they went forth, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but -- that they might be manifested that they are not all of us."
62,2,20,"And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and have known all things;"
62,2,21,"I did not write to you because you have not known the truth, but because you have known it, and because no lie is of the truth."
62,2,22,"Who is the liar, except he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? this one is the antichrist who is denying the Father and the Son;"
62,2,23,"every one who is denying the Son, neither has he the Father,"
62,2,24,"You, then, that which you heard from the beginning, in you let it remain; if in you may remain that which from the beginning you did hear, you also in the Son and in the Father shall remain,"
62,2,25,"and this is the promise that He did promise us -- the life the age-during."
62,2,26,"These things I did write to you concerning those leading you astray;"
62,2,27,"and you, the anointing that you did receive from him, in you it does remain, and you have no need that any one may teach you, but as the same anointing does teach you concerning all, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as was taught you, you shall remain in him."
62,2,28,"And now, little children, remain in him, that when he may be manifested, we may have boldness, and may not be ashamed before him, in his presence;"
62,2,29,"if you know that he is righteous, know you that every one doing the righteousness, of him has been begotten."
62,3,1,"See you what love the Father has given to us, that children of God we may be called; because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him;"
62,3,2,"beloved, now, children of God are we, and it was not yet manifested what we shall be, and we have known that if he may be manifested, like him we shall be, because we shall see him as he is;"
62,3,3,"and every one who is having this hope on him, does purify himself, even as he is pure."
62,3,4,"Every one who is doing the sin, the lawlessness also he does do, and the sin is the lawlessness,"
62,3,5,"and you have known that he was manifested that our sins he may take away, and sin is not in him;"
62,3,6,"every one who is remaining in him does not sin; every one who is sinning, has not seen him, nor known him."
62,3,7,"Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who is doing the righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous,"
62,3,8,"he who is doing the sin, of the devil he is, because from the beginning the devil does sin; for this was the Son of God manifested, that he may break up the works of the devil;"
62,3,9,"every one who has been begotten of God, sin he does not, because his seed in him does remain, and he is not able to sin, because of God he has been begotten."
62,3,10,"In this manifest are the children of God, and the children of the devil; every one who is not doing righteousness, is not of God, and he who is not loving his brother,"
62,3,11,"because this is the message that you did hear from the beginning, that we may love one another,"
62,3,12,"not as Cain -- of the evil one he was, and he did slay his brother, and therefore did he slay him? because his works were evil, and those of his brother righteous."
62,3,13,"Do not wonder, my brethren, if the world does hate you;"
62,3,14,"we -- we have known that we have passed out of the death to the life, because we love the brethren; he who is not loving the brother does remain in the death."
62,3,15,"Every one who is hating his brother -- a man-killer he is, and you have known that no man-killer has life age-during in him remaining,"
62,3,16,"in this we have known the love, because he for us his life did lay down, and we ought for the brethren the lives to lay down;"
62,3,17,"and whoever may have the goods of the world, and may view his brother having need, and may shut up his compassion from him -- how does the love of God remain in him?"
62,3,18,"My little children, may we not love in word nor in tongue, but in word and in truth!"
62,3,19,"and in this we know that of the truth we are, and before Him we shall assure our hearts,"
62,3,20,"because if our heart may condemn -- because greater is God than our heart, and He does know all things."
62,3,21,"Beloved, if our heart may not condemn us, we have boldness toward God,"
62,3,22,"and whatever we may ask, we receive from Him, because His commands we keep, and the things pleasing before Him we do,"
62,3,23,"and this is His command, that we may believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and may love one another, even as He did give command to us,"
62,3,24,"and he who is keeping His commands, in Him he does remain, and He in him; and in this we know that He does remain in us, from the Spirit that He gave us."
62,4,1,"Beloved, every spirit believe not, but prove the spirits, if of God they are, because many false prophets have gone forth to the world;"
62,4,2,"in this know you the Spirit of God; every spirit that does confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is,"
62,4,3,"and every spirit that does not confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is not; and this is that of the antichrist, which you heard that it does come, and now in the world it is already."
62,4,4,"You -- of God you are, little children, and you have overcome them; because greater is He who"
62,4,5,"They -- of the world they are; because of this from the world they speak, and the world does hear them;"
62,4,6,"we -- of God we are; he who is knowing God does hear us; he who is not of God, does not hear us; from this we know the spirit of the truth, and the spirit of the error."
62,4,7,"Beloved, may we love one another, because the love is of God, and every one who is loving, of God he has been begotten, and does know God;"
62,4,8,"he who is not loving did not know God, because God is love."
62,4,9,"In this was manifested the love of God in us, because His Son -- the only begotten -- has God sent to the world, that we may live through him;"
62,4,10,"in this is the love, not that we loved God, but that He did love us, and did send His Son a propitiation for our sins."
62,4,11,"Beloved, if thus did God love us, we also ought one another to love;"
62,4,12,"God no one has ever seen; if we may love one another, God in us does remain, and His love is having been perfected in us;"
62,4,13,"in this we know that in Him we do remain, and He in us, because of His Spirit He has given us."
62,4,14,"And we -- we have seen and do testify, that the Father has sent the Son -- Savior of the world;"
62,4,15,"whoever may confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God in him does remain, and he in God;"
62,4,16,"and we -- we have known and believed the love, that God has in us; God is love, and he who is remaining in the love, in God he does remain, and God in him."
62,4,17,"In this made perfect has been the love with us, that boldness we may have in the day of the judgment, because even as He is, we -- we also are in this world;"
62,4,18,"fear is not in the love, but the perfect love does cast out the fear, because the fear has punishment, and he who is fearing has not been made perfect in the love;"
62,4,19,"we -- we love him, because He -- He first loved us;"
62,4,20,"if any one may say -- 'I love God,' and his brother he may hate, a liar he is; for he who is not loving his brother whom he has seen, God -- whom he has not seen -- how is he able to love?"
62,4,21,"and this"
62,5,1,"Every one who is believing that Jesus is the Christ, of God he has been begotten, and every one who is loving Him who did beget, does love also him who is begotten of Him:"
62,5,2,"in this we know that we love the children of God, when we may love God, and His commands may keep;"
62,5,3,"for this is the love of God, that His commands we may keep, and His commands are not burdensome;"
62,5,4,"because every one who is begotten of God does overcome the world, and this is the victory that did overcome the world -- our faith;"
62,5,5,"who is he who is overcoming the world, if not he who is believing that Jesus is the Son of God?"
62,5,6,"This one is he who did come through water and blood -- Jesus the Christ, not in the water only, but in the water and the blood; and the Spirit it is that is testifying, because the Spirit is the truth,"
62,5,7,"because three are who are testifying"
62,5,8,""
62,5,9,"If the testimony of men we receive, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son."
62,5,10,"He who is believing in the Son of God, has the testimony in himself; he who is not believing God, a liar has made Him, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning His Son;"
62,5,11,"and this is the testimony, that life age-during did God give to us, and this -- the life -- is in His Son;"
62,5,12,"he who is having the Son, has the life; he who is not having the Son of God -- the life he has not."
62,5,13,"These things I did write to you who are believing in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that life you have age-during, and that you may believe in the name of the Son of God."
62,5,14,"And this is the boldness that we have toward Him, that if anything we may ask according to his will, He does hear us,"
62,5,15,"and if we have known that He does hear us, whatever we may ask, we have known that we have the requests that we have requested from Him."
62,5,16,"If any one may see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and He shall give to him life to those sinning not unto death; there is sin to death, not concerning it do I speak that he may beseech;"
62,5,17,"all unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto death."
62,5,18,"We have known that every one who has been begotten of God does not sin, but he who was begotten of God does keep himself, and the evil one does not touch him;"
62,5,19,"we have known that of God we are, and the whole world in the evil does lie;"
62,5,20,"and we have known that the Son of God is come, and has given us a mind, that we may know Him who is true, and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ; this one is the true God and the life age-during!"
62,5,21,"Little children, guard yourselves from the idols! Amen."
63,1,1,"The Elder to the choice Kyria, and to her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those having known the truth,"
63,1,2,"because of the truth that is remaining in us, and with us shall be to the age,"
63,1,3,"there shall be with you grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
63,1,4,"I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of your children walking in truth, even as a command we did receive from the Father;"
63,1,5,"and now I beseech you, Kyria, not as writing to you a new command, but which we had from the beginning, that we may love one another,"
63,1,6,"and this is the love, that we may walk according to His commands; this is the command, even as you did hear from the beginning, that in it you may walk,"
63,1,7,"because many leading astray did enter into the world, who are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh; this one is he who is leading astray, and the antichrist."
63,1,8,"See to yourselves that you may not lose the things that we wrought, but a full reward may receive;"
63,1,9,"every one who is transgressing, and is not remaining in the teaching of the Christ, has not God; he who is remaining in the teaching of the Christ, this one has both the Father and the Son;"
63,1,10,"if any one does come unto you, and this teaching does not bear, receive him not into the house, and say not to him, 'Hail!'"
63,1,11,"for he who is saying to him, 'Hail,' has fellowship with his evil works."
63,1,12,"Many things having to write to you, I did not intend through paper and ink, but I hope to come unto you, and speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full;"
63,1,13,"salute you do the children of your choice sister. Amen."
64,1,1,"The Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth!"
64,1,2,"beloved, concerning all things I desire you to prosper, and to be in health, even as your soul does prosper,"
64,1,3,"for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying of the truth in you, even as you in truth do walk;"
64,1,4,"greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of my children in truth walking."
64,1,5,"Beloved, faithfully do you do whatever you may work to the brethren and to the strangers,"
64,1,6,"who did testify of your love before an assembly, whom you will do well, having sent forward worthily of God,"
64,1,7,"because for"
64,1,8,"we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may become to the truth."
64,1,9,"I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first place among them -- Diotrephes -- does not receive us;"
64,1,10,"because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to remember his works that he does, with evil words prating against us; and not content with these, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and those intending he does forbid, and out of the assembly he does cast."
64,1,11,"Beloved, be not you following that which is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who is doing evil has not seen God;"
64,1,12,"to Demetrius testimony has been given by all, and by the truth itself, and we also -- we do testify, and you have known that our testimony is true."
64,1,13,"Many things I had to write, but I do not wish through ink and pen to write to you,"
64,1,14,"and I hope straightway to see you, and mouth to mouth we shall speak. Peace to you! salute you do the friends; be saluting the friends by name."
65,1,1,"Judas, of Jesus Christ a servant, and brother of James, to those sanctified in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ kept -- called,"
65,1,2,"kindness to you, and peace, and love, be multiplied!"
65,1,3,"Beloved, all diligence using to write to you concerning the common salvation, I had necessity to write to you, exhorting to agonize for the faith once delivered to the saints,"
65,1,4,"for there did come in unobserved certain men, long ago having been written beforehand to this judgment, impious, the grace of our God perverting to lasciviousness, and our only Master, God, and Lord -- Jesus Christ -- denying,"
65,1,5,"and to remind you I intend, you knowing once this, that the Lord, a people out of the land of Egypt having saved, again those who did not believe did destroy;"
65,1,6,"messengers also, those who did not keep their own principality, but did leave their proper dwelling, to a judgment of a great day, in bonds everlasting, under darkness He has kept,"
65,1,7,"as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, in like manner to these, having given themselves to whoredom, and gone after other flesh, have been set before -- an example, of fire age-during, justice suffering."
65,1,8,"In like manner, nevertheless, those dreaming also the flesh indeed do defile, and lordship they put away, and dignities they speak evil of,"
65,1,9,"yet Michael, the chief messenger, when, with the devil contending, he was disputing about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring up an evil-speaking judgment, but said, 'The Lord rebuke you!'"
65,1,10,"and these, as many things indeed as they have not known, they speak evil of; and as many things as naturally (as the irrational beasts) they understand, in these they are corrupted;"
65,1,11,"woe to them! because in the way of Cain they did go on, and to the deceit of Balaam for reward they did rush, and in the gainsaying of Korah they did perish."
65,1,12,"These are in your love-feasts craggy rocks; feasting together with you, without fear shepherding themselves; clouds without water, by winds carried about; trees autumnal, without fruit, twice dead, rooted up;"
65,1,13,"wild waves of a sea, foaming out their own shames; stars going astray, to whom the gloom of the darkness to the age hath been kept."
65,1,14,"And prophesy also to these did the seventh from Adam -- Enoch -- saying, 'Lo, the Lord did come in His saintly myriads,"
65,1,15,"to do judgment against all, and to convict all their impious ones, concerning all their works of impiety that they did impiously, and concerning all the stiff things that speak against Him did impious sinners.'"
65,1,16,"These are murmurers, repiners; according to their desires walking, and their mouth does speak great swellings, giving admiration to persons for the sake of profit;"
65,1,17,"and you, beloved, remember you the sayings spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
65,1,18,"that they said to you, that in the last time there shall be scoffers, after their own desires of impieties going on,"
65,1,19,"these are those setting themselves apart, natural men, the Spirit not having."
65,1,20,"And you, beloved, on your most holy faith building yourselves up, in the Holy Spirit praying,"
65,1,21,"yourselves in the love of God keep you, waiting for the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ -- to life age-during;"
65,1,22,"and to some be kind, judging thoroughly,"
65,1,23,"and some in fear save you, out of the fire snatching, hating even the coat from the flesh spotted."
65,1,24,"And to Him who is able to guard you not stumbling, and to set"
65,1,25,"to the only wise God our Saviour,"
66,1,1,"A revelation of Jesus Christ, that God gave to him, to show to his servants what things it behooves to come to pass quickly; and he did signify"
66,1,2,"who did testify the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as many things also as he did see."
66,1,3,"Happy is he who is reading, and those hearing, the words of the prophecy, and keeping the things written in it -- for the time is near!"
66,1,4,"John to the seven assemblies that"

66,7,8,"of the tribe of Zebulun 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Joseph 12 thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin 12 thousand were sealed."
66,7,9,"After these things I saw, and lo, a great multitude, which to number no one was able, out of all nations, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands,"
66,7,10,"and crying with a great voice, saying, 'The salvation"

66,8,12,"And the fourth messenger did sound, and smitten was the third of the sun, and the third of the moon, and the third of the stars, that darkened may be the third of them, and that the day may not shine -- the third of it, and the night in like manner."
66,8,13,"And I saw, and I heard one messenger, flying in the mid-heaven, saying with a great voice, 'Woe, woe, woe, to those dwelling upon the land from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three messengers who are about to sound.'"
66,9,1,"And the fifth messenger did sound, and I saw a star out of the heaven having fallen to the earth, and there was given to it the key of the pit of the abyss,"
66,9,2,"and he did open the pit of the abyss, and there came up a smoke out of the pit as smoke of a great furnace, and darkened was the sun and the air, from the smoke of the pit."
66,9,3,"And out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth, and there was given to them authority, as scorpions of the earth have authority,"
66,9,4,"and it was said to them that they may not injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but -- the men only who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads,"
66,9,5,"and it was given to them that they may not kill them, but that they may be tormented five months, and their torment"
66,9,6,"and in those days shall men seek the death, and they shall not find it, and they shall desire to die, and the death shall flee from them."
66,9,7,"And the likenesses of the locusts"
66,9,8,"and they had hair as hair of women, and their teeth were as"
66,9,9,"and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings"
66,9,10,"and they have tails like to scorpions, and stings were in their tails; and their authority"
66,9,11,"and they have over them a king -- the messenger of the abyss -- a name"
66,9,12,"The first woe did go forth, lo, there come yet two woes after these things."
66,9,13,"And the sixth messenger did sound, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the altar of gold that is before God,"
66,9,14,"saying to the sixth messenger who had the trumpet, 'Loose the four messengers who are bound at the great river Euphrates;'"
66,9,15,"and loosed were the four messengers, who have been made ready for the hour, and day, and month, and year, that they may kill the third of men;"
66,9,16,"and the number of the forces of the horsemen"
66,9,17,"And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting upon them, having breastplates of fire, and jacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses"
66,9,18,"by these three were the third of men killed, from the fire, and from the smoke, and from the brimstone, that is proceeding out of their mouth,"
66,9,19,"for their authorities are in their mouth, and in their tails, for their tails"
66,9,20,"And the rest of men, who were not killed in these plagues, neither did reform from the works of their hands, that they may not bow before the demons, and idols, those of gold, and those of silver, and those of brass, and those of stone, and those of wood, that are neither able to see, nor to hear, nor to walk,"
66,9,21,"yea they did not reform from their murders, nor from their sorceries, nor from their whoredoms, nor from their thefts."
66,10,1,"And I saw another strong messenger coming down out of the heaven, arrayed with a cloud, and a rainbow upon the head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire,"
66,10,2,"and he had in his hand a little scroll opened, and he did place his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the land,"
66,10,3,"and he cried with a great voice, as a lion does roar, and when he cried, speak out did the seven thunders their voices;"
66,10,4,"and when the seven thunders spake their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me, 'Seal the things that the seven thunders spake,' and, 'You may not write these things.'"
66,10,5,"And the messenger whom I saw standing upon the sea, and upon the land, did lift up his hand to the heaven,"
66,10,6,"and did swear in Him who does live to the ages of the ages, who did create the heaven and the things in it, and the land and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it -- that time shall not be yet,"
66,10,7,"but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger, when he may be about to sound, and the secret of God may be finished, as He did declare to His own servants, to the prophets."
66,10,8,"And the voice that I heard out of the heaven is again speaking with me, and saying, 'Go, take the little scroll that is open in the hand of the messenger who has been standing upon the sea, and upon the land:'"
66,10,9,"and I went away unto the messenger, saying to him, 'Give me the little scroll;' and he said to me, 'Take, and eat it up, and it shall make your belly bitter, but in your mouth it shall be sweet -- as honey.'"
66,10,10,"And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the messenger, and did eat it up, and it was in my mouth as honey -- sweet, and when I did eat it -- my belly was made bitter;"
66,10,11,"and he said to me, 'It behooves you again to prophesy about peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings -- many.'"
66,11,1,"And there was given to me a reed like to a rod, and the messenger stood, saying, 'Rise, and measure the sanctuary of God, and the altar, and those worshipping in it;"
66,11,2,"and the court that is without the sanctuary leave out, and you may not measure it, because it was given to the nations, and the holy city they shall tread down forty-two months;"
66,11,3,"and I will give to My two witnesses, and they shall prophesy days, a thousand, two hundred, sixty, arrayed with sackcloth."
66,11,4,"These are the two olive"
66,11,5,"and if any one may will to injure them, fire does proceed out of their mouth, and does devour their enemies, and if any one may will to injure them, thus it behooves him to be killed."
66,11,6,"These have authority to shut the heaven, that it may not rain in the days of their prophecy, and authority they have over the waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the land with every plague, as often as they may will."
66,11,7,"'And when they may finish their testimony, the beast that is coming up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them,"
66,11,8,"and their dead bodies"
66,11,9,"and they shall behold -- they of the peoples, and tribes, and tongues, and nations -- their dead bodies three days and a half, and their dead bodies they shall not allow to be put into tombs,"
66,11,10,"and those dwelling upon the land shall rejoice over them, and shall make merry, and gifts they shall send to one another, because these -- the two prophets -- did torment those dwelling upon the land.'"
66,11,11,"And after the three days and a half, a spirit of life from God did enter into them, and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon those beholding them,"
66,11,12,"and they heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them, 'Come up hither;' and they went up to the heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them;"
66,11,13,"and in that hour came a great earthquake, and the tenth of the city did fall, and killed in the earthquake were names of men -- seven thousands, and the rest became affrighted, and they gave glory to the God of the heaven."
66,11,14,"The second woe did go forth, lo, the third woe does come quickly."
66,11,15,"And the seventh messenger did sound, and there came great voices in the heaven, saying, 'The kingdoms of the world did become"
66,11,16,"And the twenty and four elders, who before God are sitting upon their thrones, did fall upon their faces, and did bow before God,"
66,11,17,"saying, 'We give thanks to You, O Lord God, the Almighty, who is, and who was, and who is coming, because You have taken Your great power and did reign;"
66,11,18,"and the nations were angry, and Your anger did come, and the time of the dead, to be judged, and to give the reward to Your servants, to the prophets, and to the saints, and to those fearing Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who are destroying the land.'"
66,11,19,"And opened was the sanctuary of God in the heaven, and there was seen the ark of His covenant in His sanctuary, and there did come lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail."
66,12,1,"And a great sign was seen in the heaven, a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars,"
66,12,2,"and being with child she does cry out, travailing and pained to bring forth."
66,12,3,"And there was seen another sign in the heaven, and, lo, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his head seven diadems,"
66,12,4,"and his tail does draw the third of the stars of the heaven, and he did cast them to the earth; and the dragon did stand before the woman who is about to bring forth, that when she may bring forth, her child he may devour;"
66,12,5,"and she brought forth a male child, who is about to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, and caught away was her child unto God and His throne,"
66,12,6,"and the woman did flee to the wilderness, where she has a place made ready from God, that there they may nourish her -- days a thousand, two hundred, sixty."
66,12,7,"And there came war in the heaven; Michael and his messengers did war against the dragon, and the dragon did war, and his messengers,"
66,12,8,"and they did not prevail, nor was their place found any more in the heaven;"
66,12,9,"and the great dragon was cast forth -- the old serpent, who is called 'Devil,' and 'the Adversary,' who is leading astray the whole world -- he was cast forth to the earth, and his messengers were cast forth with him."
66,12,10,"And I heard a great voice saying in the heaven, 'Now did come the salvation, and the power, and the reign, of our God, and the authority of His Christ, because cast down was the accuser of our brethren, who is accusing them before our God day and night;"
66,12,11,"and they did overcome him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life -- unto death;"
66,12,12,"because of this be glad, you heavens, and those in them who do tabernacle; woe to those inhabiting the land and the sea, because the Devil did go down unto you, having great wrath, having known that he has little time.'"
66,12,13,"And when the dragon saw that he was cast forth to the earth, he pursued the woman who did bring forth the male,"
66,12,14,"and there were given to the woman two wings of the great eagle, that she may fly to the wilderness, to her place, where she is nourished a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent;"
66,12,15,"and the serpent did cast forth after the woman, out of his mouth, water as a river, that he may cause her to be carried away by the river,"
66,12,16,"and the land did help the woman, and the land did open its mouth and did swallow up the river, that the dragon did cast forth out of his mouth;"
66,12,17,"and the dragon was angry against the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, those keeping the commands of God, and having the testimony of Jesus Christ."
66,13,1,"And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw out of the sea a beast coming up, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon its horns ten diadems, and upon its heads a name of evil speaking,"
66,13,2,"and the beast that I saw was like to a leopard, and its feet as of a bear, and its mouth as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon did give to it his power, and his throne, and great authority."
66,13,3,"And I saw one of its heads as slain to death, and its deadly stroke was healed, and all the earth did wonder after the beast,"
66,13,4,"and they did bow before the dragon who did give authority to the beast, and they did bow before the beast, saying, 'Who"
66,13,5,"And there was given to it a mouth speaking great things, and evil-speakings, and there was given to it authority to make war forty-two months,"
66,13,6,"and it did open its mouth for evil-speaking toward God, to speak evil of His name, and of His tabernacle, and of those who in the heaven tabernacle,"
66,13,7,"and there was given to it to make war with the saints, and to overcome them, and there was given to it authority over every tribe, and tongue, and nation."
66,13,8,"And bow before it shall all who are dwelling upon the land, whose names have not been written in the scroll of the life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
66,13,9,"If any one has an ear -- let him hear:"
66,13,10,"if any one a captivity does gather, into captivity he does go away; if any one by sword does kill, it behooves him by sword to be killed; here is the endurance and the faith of the saints."
66,13,11,"And I saw another beast coming up out of the land, and it had two horns, like a lamb, and it was speaking as a dragon,"
66,13,12,"and all the authority of the first beast does it do before it, and it makes the land and those dwelling in it that they shall bow before the first beast, whose deadly stroke was healed,"
66,13,13,"and it does great signs, that fire also it may make to come down from the heaven to the earth before men,"
66,13,14,"and it leads astray those dwelling on the land, because of the signs that were given it to do before the beast, saying to those dwelling upon the land to make an image to the beast that has the stroke of the sword and did live,"
66,13,15,"and there was given to it to give a spirit to the image of the beast, that also the image of the beast may speak, and"
66,13,16,"And it makes all, the small, and the great, and the rich, and the poor, and the freemen, and the servants, that it may give to them a mark upon their right hand or upon their foreheads,"
66,13,17,"and that no one may be able to buy, or to sell, except he who is having the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
66,13,18,"Here is the wisdom! He who is having the understanding, let him count the number of the beast, for the number of a man it is, and its number"
66,14,1,"And I saw, and lo, a Lamb having stood upon the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousands, having the name of his Father written upon their foreheads;"
66,14,2,"and I heard a voice out of the heaven, as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of great thunder, and a voice I heard of harpers harping with their harps,"
66,14,3,"and they sing, as it were, a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders, and no one was able to learn the song except the hundred forty-four thousands, who have been bought from the earth;"
66,14,4,"these are they who with women were not defiled, for they are virgin; these are they who are following the Lamb whithersoever he may go; these were bought from among men -- a first-fruit to God and to the Lamb --"
66,14,5,"and in their mouth there was not found guile, for unblemished are they before the throne of God."
66,14,6,"And I saw another messenger flying in mid-heaven, having good news age-during to proclaim to those dwelling upon the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,"
66,14,7,"saying in a great voice, 'Fear you God, and give to Him glory, because come did the hour of His judgment, and bow you before Him who did make the heaven, and the land, and sea, and fountains of waters.'"
66,14,8,"And another messenger did follow, saying, 'Fall, fall, did Babylon, the great city, because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom she has given to all nations to drink.'"
66,14,9,"And a third messenger did follow them, saying in a great voice, 'If any one the beast does bow before, and his image, and does receive a mark upon his forehead, or upon his hand,"
66,14,10,"he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, that has been mingled unmixed in the cup of His anger, and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy messengers, and before the Lamb,"
66,14,11,"and the smoke of their torment does go up to ages of ages; and they have no rest day and night, who are bowing before the beast and his image, also if any does receive the mark of his name."
66,14,12,"Here is endurance of the saints: here"
66,14,13,"And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying to me, 'Write: Happy are the dead who in the Lord are dying from this time!' 'Yes, (says the Spirit,) That they may rest from their labours -- and their works do follow them!'"
66,14,14,"And I saw, and lo, a white cloud, and upon the cloud"
66,14,15,"and another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary crying in a great voice to him who is sitting upon the cloud, 'Send forth your sickle and reap, because come to you has the hour of reaping, because ripe has been the harvest of the earth;'"
66,14,16,"and he who is sitting upon the cloud did put forth his sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped."
66,14,17,"And another messenger did come forth out of the sanctuary that"
66,14,18,"and another messenger did come forth out from the altar, having authority over the fire, and he called with a great cry to him having the sharp sickle, saying, 'Send forth your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, because come to perfection have her grapes;'"
66,14,19,"and the messenger did put forth his sickle to the earth, and did gather the vine of the earth, and did cast"
66,14,20,"and trodden was the wine-press outside of the city, and blood did come forth out of the wine-press -- unto the bridles of the horses, a thousand, six hundred furlongs."
66,15,1,"And I saw another sign in the heaven, great and wonderful, seven messengers having the seven last plagues, because in these was completed the wrath of God."
66,15,2,"and I saw as a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who do gain the victory over the beast, and his image, and his mark,"
66,15,3,"and they sing the song of Moses, servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, 'Great and wonderful"
66,15,4,"who may not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? because You alone"
66,15,5,"And after these things I saw, and lo, opened was the sanctuary of the tabernacle of the testimony in the heaven;"
66,15,6,"and come forth did the seven messengers having the seven plagues, out of the sanctuary, clothed in linen, pure and shining, and girded round the breasts with golden girdles:"
66,15,7,"and one of the four living creatures did give to the seven messengers seven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, who is living to the ages of the ages;"
66,15,8,"and filled was the sanctuary with smoke from the glory of God, and from His power, and no one was able to enter into the sanctuary till the seven plagues of the seven messengers may be finished."
66,16,1,"And I heard a great voice out of the sanctuary saying to the seven messengers, 'Go away, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God to the earth.'"
66,16,2,"And the first did go away, and did pour out his vial upon the land, and there came a sore -- bad and grievous -- to men, those having the mark of the beast, and those bowing to his image."
66,16,3,"And the second messenger did pour out his vial to the sea, and there came blood as of"
66,16,4,"And the third messenger did pour out his vial to the rivers, and to the fountains of the waters, and there came blood,"
66,16,5,"and I heard the messenger of the waters, saying, 'righteous, O Lord, are You, who is, and who was, and who shall be, because these things You did judge,"
66,16,6,"because blood of saints and prophets they did pour out, and blood to them You did give to drink, for they are worthy;'"
66,16,7,"and I heard another out of the altar, saying, 'Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous"
66,16,8,"And the fourth messenger did pour out his vial upon the sun, and there was given to him to scorch men with fire,"
66,16,9,"and men were scorched with great heat, and they did speak evil of the name of God, who has authority over these plagues, and they did not reform -- to give to Him glory."
66,16,10,"And the fifth messenger did pour out his vial upon the throne of the beast, and his kingdom did become darkened, and they were gnawing their tongues from the pain,"
66,16,11,"and they did speak evil of the God of the heaven, from their pains, and from their sores, and they did not reform from their works."
66,16,12,"And the sixth messenger did pour out his vial upon the great river, the Euphrates, and dried up was its water, that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun may be made ready;"
66,16,13,"and I saw"
66,16,14,"for they are spirits of demons, doing signs -- which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to bring them together to the battle of that great day of God the Almighty; --"
66,16,15,""
66,16,16,"and they did bring them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon."
66,16,17,"And the seventh messenger did pour out his vial to the air, and there came forth a great voice from the sanctuary of the heaven, from the throne, saying, 'It has come!'"
66,16,18,"and there came voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and a great earthquake came, such as came not since men came upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake -- so great!"
66,16,19,"And it came -- the great city -- into three parts, and the cities of the nations did fall, and Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the wrath of His anger,"
66,16,20,"and every island did flee away, and mountains were not found,"
66,16,21,"and great hail (as of talent weight) does come down out of the heaven upon men, and men did speak evil of God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague is very great."
66,17,1,"And there came one of the seven messengers, who were having the seven vials, and he spake with me, saying to me, 'Come, I will show to you the judgment of the great whore, who is sitting upon the many waters,"
66,17,2,"with whom the kings of the earth did commit whoredom; and made drunk from the wine of her whoredom were those inhabiting the earth;'"
66,17,3,"and he carried me away to a wilderness in the Spirit, and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of evil-speaking, having seven heads and ten horns,"
66,17,4,"and the woman was arrayed with purple and scarlet-colour, and gilded with gold, and precious stone, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and uncleanness of her whoredom,"
66,17,5,"and upon her forehead was a name written: 'Secret, Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Whores, and the Abominations of the earth.'"
66,17,6,"And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the saints, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus, and I did wonder -- having seen her -- with great wonder."
66,17,7,"And the messenger said to me, 'Why did you wonder? I -- I will tell you the secret of the woman and of the beast that"
66,17,8,"'The beast that you did see: it was, and it is not; and it is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go away to destruction, and wonder shall those dwelling upon the earth, whose names have not been written upon the scroll of the life from the foundation of the world, beholding the beast that was, and is not, although it is."
66,17,9,"'Here"
66,17,10,"and there are seven kings, the five did fall, and the one is, the other did not yet come, and when he may come, it behooves him to remain a little time;"
66,17,11,"and the beast that was, and is not, he also is eighth, and out of the seven he is, and to destruction he does go away."
66,17,12,"'And the ten horns that you sawest, are ten kings, who a kingdom did not yet receive, but authority as kings the same hour do receive with the beast,"
66,17,13,"these have one mind, and their own power and authority to the beast they shall give over;"
66,17,14,"these with the Lamb shall make war, and the Lamb shall overcome them, because Lord of lords he is, and King of kings, and those with him are called, and choice, and stedfast.'"
66,17,15,"And he said to me, 'The waters that you did see, where the whore does sit, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues;'"
66,17,16,"and the ten horns that you did see upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her in fire,"
66,17,17,"for God did give into their hearts to do its mind, and to make one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast till the sayings of God may be complete,"
66,17,18,"and the woman that you did see is the great city that is having reign over the kings of the land.'"
66,18,1,"And after these things I saw another messenger coming down out of the heaven, having great authority, and the earth was lightened from his glory,"
66,18,2,"and he did cry in might -- a great voice, saying, 'Fall, fall did Babylon the great, and she became a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird,"
66,18,3,"because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom have all the nations drunk, and the kings of the earth with her did commit whoredom, and merchants of the earth from the power of her revel were made rich."
66,18,4,"And I heard another voice out of the heaven, saying, 'Come forth out of her, My people, that you may not partake with her sins, and that you may not receive of her plagues,"
66,18,5,"because her sins did follow -- unto the heaven, and God did remember her unrighteousness."
66,18,6,"Render to her as also she did render to you, and double to her doubles according to her works; in the cup that she did mingle to her double."
66,18,7,"'As much as she did glorify herself and did revel, so much torment and sorrow give to her, because in her heart she says, I sit a queen, and a widow I am not, and sorrow I shall not see;"
66,18,8,"because of this, in one day, shall come her plagues, death, and sorrow, and famine; and in fire she shall be utterly burned, because strong"
66,18,9,"And weep over her, and smite themselves for her, shall the kings of the earth, who with her did commit whoredom and did revel, when they may see the smoke of her burning,"
66,18,10,"from afar having stood because of the fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city! Babylon, the strong city! because in one hour did come your judgment."
66,18,11,"'And the merchants of the earth shall weep and sorrow over her, because their lading no one does buy any more;"
66,18,12,"lading of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most precious wood, and brass, and iron, and marble,"
66,18,13,"and cinnamon, and odours, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots, and of bodies and souls of men."
66,18,14,"'And the fruits of the desire of your soul did go away from you, and all things -- the dainty and the bright -- did go away from you, and no more at all may you find them."
66,18,15,"The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, far off shall stand because of the fear of her torment, weeping, and sorrowing,"
66,18,16,"and saying, Woe, woe, the great city, that was arrayed with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and gilded in gold, and precious stone, and pearls -- because in one hour so much riches were made waste!"
66,18,17,"'And every shipmaster, and all the company upon the ships, and sailors, and as many as work the sea, far off stood,"
66,18,18,"and were crying, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What"
66,18,19,"and they did cast dust upon their heads, and were crying out, weeping and sorrowing, saying, Woe, woe, the great city! in which were made rich all having ships in the sea, out of her costliness -- for in one hour was she made waste."
66,18,20,"'Be glad over her, O heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, because God did judge your judgment of her!'"
66,18,21,"And one strong messenger did take up a stone as a great millstone, and did cast"
66,18,22,"and voice of harpers, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, may not be heard at all in you any more; and any artisan of any art may not be found at all in you any more; and noise of a millstone may not be heard at all in you any more;"
66,18,23,"and light of a lamp may not shine at all in you any more; and voice of bridegroom and of bride may not be heard at all in you any more; because your merchants were the great ones of the earth, because in your sorcery were all the nations led astray,"
66,18,24,"and in her blood of prophets and of saints was found, and of all those who have been slain on the earth.'"
66,19,1,"And after these things I heard a great voice of a great multitude in the heaven, saying, 'Alleluia! the salvation, and the glory, and the honour, and the power,"
66,19,2,"because true and righteous"
66,19,3,"and a second time they said, 'Alleluia;' and her smoke does come up -- to the ages of the ages!"
66,19,4,"And fall down did the elders -- the twenty and four -- and the four living creatures, and they did bow before God who is sitting upon the throne, saying, 'Amen, Alleluia.'"
66,19,5,"And a voice out of the throne did come forth, saying, 'Praise our God, all you His servants, and those fearing Him, both the small and the great;'"
66,19,6,"and I heard as the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, 'Alleluia! because reign did the Lord God -- the Almighty!"
66,19,7,"may we rejoice and exult, and give the glory to Him, because come did the marriage of the Lamb, and his wife did make herself ready;"
66,19,8,"and there was given to her that she may be arrayed with fine linen, pure and shining, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.'"
66,19,9,"And he said to me, 'Write: Happy"
66,19,10,"and I fell before his feet, to bow before him, and he said to me, 'See -- not! fellow servant of you am I, and of your brethren, those having the testimony of Jesus; bow before God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy.'"
66,19,11,"And I saw the heaven having been opened, and lo, a white horse, and he who is sitting upon it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness does he judge and war,"
66,19,12,"and his eyes"
66,19,13,"and he is arrayed with a garment covered with blood, and his name is called, The Word of God."
66,19,14,"And the armies in the heaven were following him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen -- white and pure;"
66,19,15,"and out of his mouth does proceed a sharp sword, that with it he may smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and he does tread the press of the wine of the wrath and the anger of God the Almighty,"
66,19,16,"and he has upon the garment and upon his thigh the name written, 'King of kings, and Lord of lords.'"
66,19,17,"And I saw one messenger standing in the sun, and he cried, a great voice, saying to all the birds that are flying in mid-heaven, 'Come and be gathered together to the supper of the great God,"
66,19,18,"that you may eat flesh of kings, and flesh of chiefs of thousands, and flesh of strong men, and flesh of horses, and of those sitting on them, and the flesh of all -- freemen and servants -- both small and great.'"
66,19,19,"And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, having been gathered together to make war with him who is sitting upon the horse, and with his army;"
66,19,20,"and the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who did the signs before him, in which he led astray those who did receive the mark of the beast, and those who did bow before his image; living they were cast -- the two -- to the lake of the fire, that is burning with brimstone;"
66,19,21,"and the rest were killed with the sword of him who is sitting on the horse, which"
66,20,1,"And I saw a messenger coming down out of the heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain over his hand,"
66,20,2,"and he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, who is Devil and Adversary, and did bind him a thousand years,"
66,20,3,"and he cast him to the abyss, and did shut him up, and put a seal upon him, that he may not lead astray the nations any more, till the thousand years may be finished; and after these it behooves him to be loosed a little time."
66,20,4,"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them, and the souls of those who have been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus, and because of the word of God, and who did not bow before the beast, nor his image, and did not receive the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand, and they did live and reign with Christ the thousand years;"
66,20,5,"and the rest of the dead did not live again till the thousand years may be finished; this"
66,20,6,"Happy and holy"
66,20,7,"And when the thousand years may be finished, the Adversary shall be loosed out of his prison,"
66,20,8,"and he shall go forth to lead the nations astray, that are in the four corners of the earth -- Gog and Magog -- to gather them together to war, of whom the number"
66,20,9,"and they did go up over the breadth of the land, and did surround the camp of the saints, and the beloved city, and there came down fire from God out of the heaven, and devoured them;"
66,20,10,"and the Devil, who is leading them astray, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where"
66,20,11,"And I saw a great white throne, and Him who is sitting upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven did flee away, and place was not found for them;"
66,20,12,"and I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and scrolls were opened, and another scroll was opened, which is that of the life, and the dead were judged out of the things written in the scrolls -- according to their works;"
66,20,13,"and the sea did give up those dead in it, and the death and the hades did give up the dead in them, and they were judged, each one according to their works;"
66,20,14,"and the death and the hades were cast to the lake of the fire -- this"
66,20,15,"and if any one was not found written in the scroll of the life, he was cast to the lake of the fire."
66,21,1,"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth did pass away, and the sea is not any more;"
66,21,2,"and I, John, saw the holy city -- new Jerusalem -- coming down from God out of the heaven, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband;"
66,21,3,"and I heard a great voice out of the heaven, saying, 'Lo, the tabernacle of God"
66,21,4,"and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, and the death shall not be any more, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor shall there be any more pain, because the first things did go away.'"
66,21,5,"And He who is sitting upon the throne said, 'Lo, new I make all things; and He said to me, 'Write, because these words are true and stedfast;'"
66,21,6,"and He said to me, 'It has been done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End; I, to him who is thirsting, will give of the fountain of the water of the life freely;"
66,21,7,"he who is overcoming shall inherit all things, and I will be to him -- a God, and he shall be to me -- the son,"
66,21,8,"and to fearful, and unstedfast, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the liars, their part"
66,21,9,"And there came unto me one of the seven messengers, who have the seven vials that are full of the seven last plagues, and he spake with me, saying, 'Come, I will show you the bride of the Lamb -- the wife,'"
66,21,10,"and he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and did show to me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God,"
66,21,11,"having the glory of God, and her light"
66,21,12,"having also a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve messengers, and names written thereon, which are"
66,21,13,"at the east three gates, at the north three gates, at the south three gates, at the west three gates;"
66,21,14,"and the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
66,21,15,"And he who is speaking with me had a golden reed, that he may measure the city, and its gates, and its wall;"
66,21,16,"and the city lies square, and the length of it is as great as the breadth; and he did measure the city with the reed -- furlongs twelve thousand; the length, and the breadth, and the height, of it are equal;"
66,21,17,"and he measured its wall, an hundred forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of the messenger;"
66,21,18,"and the building of its wall was jasper, and the city"
66,21,19,"and the foundations of the wall of the city with every precious stone have been adorned; the first foundation jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;"
66,21,20,"the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst."
66,21,21,"And the twelve gates"
66,21,22,"And a sanctuary I did not see in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, is its sanctuary, and the Lamb,"
66,21,23,"and the city has no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they may shine in it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp of it"
66,21,24,"and the nations of the saved in its light shall walk, and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it,"
66,21,25,"and its gates shall not at all be shut by day, for night shall not be there;"
66,21,26,"and they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it;"
66,21,27,"and there may not at all enter into it any thing defiling and doing abomination, and a lie, but -- those written in the scroll of the life of the Lamb."
66,22,1,"And he showed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb:"
66,22,2,"in the midst of its broad place, and of the river on this side and on that,"
66,22,3,"and any curse there shall not be any more, and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him,"
66,22,4,"and they shall see His face, and His name"
66,22,5,"and night shall not be there, and they have no need of a lamp and light of a sun, because the Lord God does give them light, and they shall reign -- to the ages of the ages."
66,22,6,"And he said to me, 'These words"
66,22,7,""
66,22,8,"And I, John, am he who is seeing these things and hearing, and when I heard and beheld, I fell down to bow before the feet of the messenger who is showing me these things;"
66,22,9,"and he said to me, 'See -- not; for fellow-servant of you am I, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those keeping the words of this scroll; before God bow.'"
66,22,10,"And he said to me, 'You may not seal the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is near;"
66,22,11,"he who is unrighteous -- let him be unrighteous still, and he who is filthy -- let him be filthy still, and he who is righteous -- let him be declared righteous still, and he who is sanctified -- let him be sanctified still:"
66,22,12,""
66,22,13,""
66,22,14,"'Happy are those doing His commands that the authority shall be theirs unto the tree of the life, and by the gates they may enter into the city;"
66,22,15,"and without"
66,22,16,""
66,22,17,"And the Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and he who is hearing -- let him say, Come; and he who is thirsting -- let him come; and he who is willing -- let him take the water of life freely."
66,22,18,"'For I testify to every one hearing the words of the prophecy of this scroll, if any one may add unto these, God shall add to him the plagues that have been written in this scroll,"
66,22,19,"and if any one may take away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the scroll of the life, and out of the holy city, and the things that have been written in this scroll.'"
66,22,20,"he says -- who is testifying these things --"
66,22,21,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ"
