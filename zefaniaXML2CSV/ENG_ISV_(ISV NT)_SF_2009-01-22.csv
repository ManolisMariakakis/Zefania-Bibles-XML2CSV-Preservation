40,1,1,"This is a record of the birth of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
40,1,2,"Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers."
40,1,3,"Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez fathered Hezron, Hezron fathered Aram,"
40,1,4,"Aram fathered Aminidab, Aminidab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon."
40,1,5,"Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, Obed fathered Jesse,"
40,1,6,"and Jesse fathered King David.David fathered Solomon by the wife of Uriah,"
40,1,7,"Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, Abijah fathered Asaph,"
40,1,8,"Asaph fathered Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, Joram fathered Uzziah,"
40,1,9,"Uzziah fathered Jotham, Jotham fathered Ahaz, Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,"
40,1,10,"Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, Manasseh fathered Amos, and Amos fathered Josiah."
40,1,11,"Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon."
40,1,12,"After the deportation to Babylon, Jechoniah fathered Salathiel, Salathiel fathered Zerubbabel,"
40,1,13,"Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, Eliakim fathered Azor,"
40,1,14,"Azor fathered Zadok, Zadok fathered Achim, Achim fathered Eliud,"
40,1,15,"Eliud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob."
40,1,16,"Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, who was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Christ."
40,1,17,"So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon were fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ were fourteen generations."
40,1,18,"Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened in this way. When his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, before they lived together she was discovered to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit."
40,1,19,"Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to disgrace her, decided to divorce her secretly."
40,1,20,"After he had thought about it, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
40,1,21,"She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he is the one who will save his people from their sins.”"
40,1,22,"Now all this happened to fulfill what was declared by the Lord through the prophet when he said,"
40,1,23,"“See, a virgin will become pregnantand give birth to a son,	and they will name him Immanuel,”which means, “God with us.”"
40,1,24,"When Joseph got up from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary as his wife."
40,1,25,"He did not have marital relations with her until she had given birth to a son; and he named him Jesus."
40,2,1,"After Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem"
40,2,2,"and asked, “Where is the one who was born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.”"
40,2,3,"When King Herod heard this he was troubled, and all the people of Jerusalem with him."
40,2,4,"He called together all the high priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Christ was to be born."
40,2,5,"They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea. For that is what was written by the prophet:"
40,2,6,"‘O Bethlehem in the land of Judah,you are by no means least among the rulers of Judah.	For from you will come a rulerwho will shepherd my people Israel.’”"
40,2,7,"Then Herod secretly called together the wise men and found out from them the time the star had appeared."
40,2,8,"Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “As you go, search carefully for the child. When you find him, tell me so that I, too, may go and worship him.”"
40,2,9,"After listening to the king, they set out, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it came and stopped over the place where the child was."
40,2,10,"When they saw the star, they were ecstatic with joy."
40,2,11,"After they went into the house and saw the child with his mother Mary, they fell down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure sacks and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh."
40,2,12,"Having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they left for their own country by a different road."
40,2,13,"After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and kill him.”"
40,2,14,"So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother and left at night for Egypt."
40,2,15,"He stayed there until Herod's death in order to fulfill what was declared by the Lord through the prophet when he said, “Out of Egypt I called my Son.”"
40,2,16,"When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he flew into a rage and ordered the execution of all the male children in Bethlehem and all its neighboring regions who were two years old and younger, according to the time that he had determined from the wise men."
40,2,17,"Then what was declared by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said,"
40,2,18,"“A voice was heard in Ramah:wailing and great mourning.	Rachel was crying for her children.She refused to be comforted,because they no longer existed.”"
40,2,19,"But after Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt"
40,2,20,"and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to kill the child are dead.”"
40,2,21,"So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother and went into the land of Israel."
40,2,22,"But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he left for the region of Galilee"
40,2,23,"and came and settled in a town called Nazareth in order to fulfill what was said by the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”"
40,3,1,"In those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea"
40,3,2,"and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near!”"
40,3,3,"He was the one the prophet Isaiah was referring to when he said,	“He is a voice calling out in the wilderness:‘Prepare the way for the Lord!Make his paths straight!’”"
40,3,4,"John had clothing made of camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist. His diet consisted of locusts and wild honey."
40,3,5,"Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region along the Jordan began flocking to him,"
40,3,6,"being baptized by him in the Jordan River while they confessed their sins."
40,3,7,"But when John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them, “You children of serpents! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?"
40,3,8,"Produce fruit that is consistent with repentance!"
40,3,9,"Don't think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our forefather.’ For I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones!"
40,3,10,"The ax already lies against the roots of the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."
40,3,11,"I am baptizing you with water as a token of repentance, but the one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. It is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
40,3,12,"His winnowing fork is in his hand. He will clean up his threshing floor and gather his grain into the barn, but he will burn the chaff with inextinguishable fire.”"
40,3,13,"Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John."
40,3,14,"But John tried to stop him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?”"
40,3,15,"But Jesus answered him,"
40,3,16,"When Jesus had been baptized, he immediately came up out of the water. Suddenly the heavens opened up for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him."
40,3,17,"Then a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him!”"
40,4,1,"Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil."
40,4,2,"After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he finally became hungry."
40,4,3,"The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”"
40,4,4,"But he answered,"
40,4,5,"Then the devil took him to the Holy City and had him stand on the highest point of the temple."
40,4,6,"He said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written,	‘God will put his angels in charge of you,’and	‘With their hands they will hold you up,so that you will never hit your foot against a rock.’”"
40,4,7,"Jesus said to him,"
40,4,8,"Once more the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor."
40,4,9,"He said to Jesus, “I will give you all of these things if you will bow down and worship me!”"
40,4,10,"Then Jesus said to him,"
40,4,11,"Then the devil left him, and angels came and began ministering to him."
40,4,12,"Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he went back to Galilee."
40,4,13,"He left Nazareth and went and settled in Capernaum by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,"
40,4,14,"in order to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,"
40,4,15,"“O Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,on the road to the sea, across the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles!"
40,4,16,"The people living in darkness have seen a great light,and for those living in the land and shadow of death,a light has risen.”"
40,4,17,"From then on, Jesus began to preach and to say,"
40,4,18,"While Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers—Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen."
40,4,19,"He said to them,"
40,4,20,"So at once they left their nets and followed him."
40,4,21,"Going on from there he saw two other brothers—James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee repairing their nets. When he called them,"
40,4,22,"they immediately left the boat and their father and followed him."
40,4,23,"Then he went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness among the people."
40,4,24,"His fame spread throughout Syria, and people brought to him all who were sick—those afflicted with various diseases and pains, the demon-possessed, the epileptics, and the paralyzed—and he healed them."
40,4,25,"Large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from across the Jordan."
40,5,1,"When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a hillside and sat down. His disciples came to him,"
40,5,2,"and he opened his mouth and began to teach them, saying,"

40,7,28,"When Jesus had finished saying all these things, the crowds were utterly amazed at his teaching,"
40,7,29,"for he was teaching them like a person who had authority, and not like their scribes."
40,8,1,"When Jesus came down from the hillside, large crowds followed him."
40,8,2,"Suddenly a leper came up to him, fell down before him, and said, “Sir, if you want to, you can make me clean.”"
40,8,3,"So Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said,"
40,8,4,"Then Jesus said to him,"
40,8,5,"When Jesus returned to Capernaum, a centurion came up to him and begged him repeatedly,"
40,8,6,"“Sir, my servant is lying at home paralyzed and in terrible pain.”"
40,8,7,"Jesus said to him,"
40,8,8,"The centurion replied, “Sir, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
40,8,9,"For I, too, am a man under authority and have soldiers under me. I say to one ‘Go’ and he goes, to another ‘Come’ and he comes, and to my servant ‘Do this’ and he does it.”"
40,8,10,"When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him,"
40,8,11,""
40,8,12,""
40,8,13,"Then Jesus said to the centurion,"
40,8,14,"When Jesus went into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed, sick with a fever."
40,8,15,"He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began serving him."
40,8,16,"When evening came, people brought to him many who were possessed by demons. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all those who were sick."
40,8,17,"This was to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,	“It was he who took our illnesses awayand removed our diseases.”"
40,8,18,"When Jesus saw the large crowds around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side."
40,8,19,"Now a scribe came up and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”"
40,8,20,"Jesus told him,"
40,8,21,"Then another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”"
40,8,22,"But Jesus told him,"
40,8,23,"When Jesus got into the boat, his disciples went with him."
40,8,24,"Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat began to be swamped by the waves. Yet Jesus kept sleeping."
40,8,25,"They went to him and woke him up, saying, “Lord, save us! We're going to die!”"
40,8,26,"He said to them,"
40,8,27,"The men were amazed and said, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!”"
40,8,28,"When Jesus arrived on the other side in the region of the Gerasenes, two demon-possessed men met him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could travel on that road."
40,8,29,"Suddenly they screamed, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Did you come here to torture us before the proper time?”"
40,8,30,"Now a large herd of pigs was grazing some distance away from them."
40,8,31,"So the demons began to plead with Jesus, saying, “If you drive us out, send us into that herd of pigs.”"
40,8,32,"He said to them,"
40,8,33,"Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs ran away, they came into the city and reported everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men."
40,8,34,"Then the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and as soon as they saw him, they begged him to leave their region."
40,9,1,"After getting into a boat, Jesus crossed to the other side and came to his own city."
40,9,2,"All at once some people brought him a paralyzed man lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man,"
40,9,3,"Then some of the scribes said to themselves, “This fellow is blaspheming!”"
40,9,4,"But Jesus knew their thoughts and said,"
40,9,5,""
40,9,6,""
40,9,7,"So the man got up and went home."
40,9,8,"When the crowds saw this, they became frightened and glorified God for giving such authority to humans."
40,9,9,"As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's desk and said to him,"
40,9,10,"While he was having dinner at Matthew's home, many tax collectors and sinners arrived and began eating with Jesus and his disciples."
40,9,11,"The Pharisees saw this and said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”"
40,9,12,"When Jesus heard that, he said,"
40,9,13,""
40,9,14,"Then John's disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?”"
40,9,15,"Jesus said to them,"
40,9,16,""
40,9,17,""
40,9,18,"While Jesus was telling them these things, an official came up, fell down before him, and said, “My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”"
40,9,19,"So Jesus got up and followed him, along with his disciples."
40,9,20,"Just then a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the tassel of his garment."
40,9,21,"For she had been saying to herself, “If I just touch his robe, I will get well.”"
40,9,22,"When Jesus turned and saw her, he said,"
40,9,23,"When Jesus came to the official's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,"
40,9,24,"he said,"
40,9,25,"But when the crowd had been driven outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up."
40,9,26,"The news of this spread throughout that land."
40,9,27,"As Jesus was traveling on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”"
40,9,28,"When he had gone into the house, the blind men came to him.Jesus asked them,"
40,9,29,"Then he touched their eyes and said,"
40,9,30,"And their eyes were opened.Then Jesus sternly told them,"
40,9,31,"But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that land."
40,9,32,"As they were going out, a man who couldn't talk because he was demon-possessed was brought to him."
40,9,33,"As soon as the demon had been driven out, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”"
40,9,34,"But the Pharisees kept saying, “He drives out demons by the ruler of demons.”"
40,9,35,"Then Jesus began traveling through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness."
40,9,36,"When he saw the crowds, he was deeply moved with compassion for them, because they were troubled and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."
40,9,37,"Then he said to his disciples,"
40,9,38,""
40,10,1,"Then Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and every illness."

40,26,9,"Surely this perfume could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the destitute.”"
40,26,10,"But knowing this, Jesus said to them,"
40,26,11,""
40,26,12,""
40,26,13,""
40,26,14,"Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the high priests"

40,26,16,"and from then on he began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus."
40,26,17,"On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples went to Jesus and said, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?”"
40,26,18,"He said,"
40,26,19,"So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal."
40,26,20,"When evening came, Jesus was sitting at the table with the twelve."

40,26,22,"Feeling deeply distressed, each one began to say to him, “Surely I am not the one, Lord?”"

40,26,26,"While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and handed it to the disciples, saying,"
40,26,27,"Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,"
40,26,28,""
40,26,29,""

40,26,35,"Peter told him, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the disciples said the same thing."
40,26,36,"Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane. He said to the disciples,"
40,26,37,"Taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, he began to be grieved and troubled."
40,26,38,"Then he said to them,"
40,26,39,"Going on a little farther, he fell on his face and prayed,"
40,26,40,"When he went back to the disciples, he found them asleep. He said to Peter,"
40,26,41,""
40,26,42,"He went away a second time and prayed,"

40,26,46,""
40,26,47,"Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. A large crowd armed with swords and clubs was with him. They were from the high priests and elders of the people."
40,26,48,"Now the betrayer personally had given them a signal, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him.”"
40,26,49,"So Judas immediately went up to Jesus and said, “Hello, Rabbi!” and kissed him tenderly."
40,26,50,"Jesus said to him,"
40,26,51,"Suddenly, one of the men with Jesus reached out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear."
40,26,52,"Jesus said to him,"

40,26,54,""
40,26,55,"At this point Jesus said to the crowds,"

40,26,57,"Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled."
40,26,58,"Peter, however, followed him at a distance as far as the high priest's courtyard. He went inside and sat down with the servants to see how this would end."
40,26,59,"Meanwhile, the high priests and the whole Council were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order to have him put to death."
40,26,60,"But they couldn't find any, even though many false witnesses had come forward. At last two men came forward"
40,26,61,"and stated, “This man said, ‘I can destroy the sanctuary of God and rebuild it in three days.’”"
40,26,62,"At this, the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Don't you have any answer to what these men are testifying against you?”"
40,26,63,"But Jesus was silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I command you by the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!”"
40,26,64,"Jesus said to him,"
40,26,65,"Then the high priest tore his robes and said, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Look, you yourselves have just heard the blasphemy!"
40,26,66,"What is your verdict?”They replied, “He deserves to die!”"
40,26,67,"Then they spit in his face and hit him. Some slapped him,"
40,26,68,"saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is the one who hit you?”"
40,26,69,"Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard when a servant girl came up to him and said, “You, too, were with Jesus the Galilean.”"
40,26,70,"But he denied it in front of them all, saying, “I don't know what you're talking about.”"
40,26,71,"As he went out to the gateway, another woman saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus from Nazareth.”"
40,26,72,"Again he denied it and swore with an oath, “I don't know the man!”"
40,26,73,"After a little while the people who were standing there came up and said to Peter, “Obviously you're also one of them, because your accent gives you away.”"
40,26,74,"Then he began to invoke a divine curse and to swear with an oath, “I don't know the man!” Just then a rooster crowed."
40,26,75,"Peter remembered the words of Jesus when he said,"
40,27,1,"When morning came, all the high priests and the elders of the people conspired against Jesus to put him to death."
40,27,2,"They bound him with chains, led him away, and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor."
40,27,3,"Then Judas, who had betrayed him, regretted what had happened when he saw that Jesus was condemned. He brought the thirty pieces of silver back to the high priests and elders,"
40,27,4,"saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.”But they said, “What do we care? See to that yourself.”"
40,27,5,"Then he flung the pieces of silver into the sanctuary and went outside. Then he went away and hanged himself."
40,27,6,"The high priests picked up the pieces of silver and said, “It is not lawful to put this into the temple treasury, because it is blood money.”"
40,27,7,"So they decided to use the money to buy the Potter's Field as a burial ground for foreigners."
40,27,8,"That is why that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day."
40,27,9,"Then what had been declared through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said,	“They took the thirty pieces of silver,the value of the man on whom a price had been set by the Israelites,"
40,27,10,"and they gave them for the potter's field,as the Lord commanded me.”"
40,27,11,"Meanwhile, Jesus was made to stand in front of the governor. The governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”Jesus said,"
40,27,12,"While Jesus was being accused by the high priests and elders, he made no reply."
40,27,13,"Then Pilate said to him, “Don't you hear how many charges they're bringing against you?”"
40,27,14,"But Jesus did not reply at all, so that the governor was very surprised."
40,27,15,"At every festival the governor had a custom of releasing to the crowd any prisoner whom they wanted."
40,27,16,"At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas."
40,27,17,"So when the people had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which man do you want me to release for you—Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Christ?”"
40,27,18,"For he knew that they had handed him over because of jealousy."
40,27,19,"While he was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him a message. It said, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for today I have suffered terribly because of a dream about him.”"
40,27,20,"But the high priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to demand that Jesus be put to death."
40,27,21,"So the governor said to them, “Which of the two men do you want me to release for you?”They said, “Barabbas!”"
40,27,22,"Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus, who is called the Christ?”They all said, “Let him be crucified!”"
40,27,23,"He asked, “What has he done wrong?”But they kept shouting louder and louder, “Let him be crucified!”"
40,27,24,"Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was about to break out instead. So he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man's blood. You must see to that yourselves.”"
40,27,25,"All the people answered, “Let his blood be on us and our children!”"
40,27,26,"Then he released Barabbas for them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified."
40,27,27,"Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the imperial headquarters and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him."
40,27,28,"They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him."
40,27,29,"Twisting some thorns into a victor's crown, they placed it on his head and put a stick in his right hand. They knelt down in front of him and began making fun of him, saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!”"
40,27,30,"Then they spit on him and took the stick and hit him repeatedly on his head."
40,27,31,"When they had finished making fun of him, they stripped him of the robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to crucify him."
40,27,32,"As they were leaving, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to carry Jesus’ cross."
40,27,33,"When they came to a place called Golgotha (which means “Skull Place”),"
40,27,34,"they offered him a drink of wine mixed with gall. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it."
40,27,35,"After they had crucified him, they divided his clothes by throwing dice."
40,27,36,"Then they sat down there and continued guarding him."
40,27,37,"Above his head they placed the charge against him. It read, “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.”"
40,27,38,"At that time two bandits were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left."
40,27,39,"Those who passed by kept insulting him, shaking their heads,"
40,27,40,"and saying, “You who were going to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days—save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”"
40,27,41,"In the same way the high priests, along with the scribes and elders, were also making fun of him. They kept saying,"
40,27,42,"“He saved others but can't save himself! He is the king of Israel. Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
40,27,43,"He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he cares for him. After all, he said,"
40,27,44,"Even the bandits who were crucified with him kept insulting him in the same way."
40,27,45,"Now from noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon."
40,27,46,"About three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice,"
40,27,47,"When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, “He's calling for Elijah.”"
40,27,48,"So one of the men at once ran off, took a sponge, and soaked it in some sour wine. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink."
40,27,49,"But the others kept saying, “Wait! Let's see if Elijah will come and save him.”"
40,27,50,"Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice again and gave up his spirit."
40,27,51,"Suddenly the curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the rocks were split open,"
40,27,52,"the tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had died were raised."
40,27,53,"After his resurrection, they came out of their tombs and went into the Holy City and appeared to many people."
40,27,54,"When the centurion and those guarding Jesus with him saw the earthquake and the other things that were taking place, they were terrified and said, “This man certainly was the Son of God!”"
40,27,55,"Now many women were also there, watching from a distance. They had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had ministered to him."
40,27,56,"Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons."
40,27,57,"When evening came, a rich man arrived from Arimathea. His name was Joseph, and he had become a disciple of Jesus."
40,27,58,"He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered it to be handed over."
40,27,59,"So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth."
40,27,60,"Then he placed it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. After rolling a large stone across the door of the tomb, he went away."
40,27,61,"But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary remained there, sitting in front of the tomb."
40,27,62,"The next day (which is after the Day of Preparation), the high priests and Pharisees gathered before Pilate"
40,27,63,"and said, “Sir, we remember how that impostor said while he was still alive,"
40,27,64,"Therefore, order the tomb to be secured until the third day, or his disciples may go and steal him and then tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead.’ Then the last deception would be worse than the first one.”"
40,27,65,"Pilate told them, “You have a military guard. Go and make the tomb as secure as you know how.”"
40,27,66,"So they went and secured the tomb by putting a seal on the stone in the presence of the guards."
40,28,1,"After the Sabbath, around dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to take a look at the tomb."
40,28,2,"Suddenly there was a powerful earthquake. For an angel of the Lord had come down from heaven, stepped forward, rolled the stone away, and was sitting on it."
40,28,3,"His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow."
40,28,4,"Because they were so afraid of him, the guards shook and became like dead men."
40,28,5,"But the angel said to the women, “Stop being afraid! For I know you're looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
40,28,6,"He is not here. He has been raised, just as he said. Come and see the place where he was lying."
40,28,7,"Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee, and you will see him there. Remember, I have told you!”"
40,28,8,"So they quickly left the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples."
40,28,9,"Suddenly Jesus met them and said,"
40,28,10,"Then Jesus said to them,"
40,28,11,"While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the high priests all that had happened."
40,28,12,"So they met with the elders and agreed on a plan to give the soldiers a large amount of money."
40,28,13,"They said, “Say that his disciples came at night and stole him while you were sleeping."
40,28,14,"If this is reported to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”"
40,28,15,"So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day."
40,28,16,"The eleven disciples went into Galilee to the hillside to which Jesus had directed them."
40,28,17,"When they saw him, they worshiped him, though some had doubts."
40,28,18,"Then Jesus came up and said to them,"
40,28,19,""
40,28,20,""
41,1,1,"This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God."
41,1,2,"As it is written in the prophet Isaiah,“See! I am sending my messenger ahead of you,who will prepare your way."
41,1,3,"He is a voice calling out in the wilderness:‘Prepare the way for the Lord!Make his paths straight!’”"
41,1,4,"John was baptizing in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins."
41,1,5,"People from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were flocking to him, being baptized by him while they confessed their sins."
41,1,6,"Now John was dressed in camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey."
41,1,7,"He kept proclaiming, “The one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to bend down and untie his sandal straps."
41,1,8,"I baptized you with water, but it is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”"
41,1,9,"In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan."
41,1,10,"Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove."
41,1,11,"Then a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you!”"
41,1,12,"At once the Spirit drove him into the wilderness."
41,1,13,"He was in the wilderness for forty days being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him."
41,1,14,"Now after John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee and proclaimed the gospel about the kingdom of God."
41,1,15,"He said,"
41,1,16,"While Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen."
41,1,17,"Jesus said to them,"
41,1,18,"So immediately they left their nets and followed him."
41,1,19,"Going on a little farther he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat repairing their nets."
41,1,20,"He immediately called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him."
41,1,21,"Then they went to Capernaum. As soon as it was the Sabbath, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach."
41,1,22,"The people were utterly amazed at his teaching, for he was teaching them like one with authority and not like their scribes."
41,1,23,"Suddenly there was a man in their synagogue who had an unclean spirit. He screamed,"
41,1,24,"“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”"
41,1,25,"But Jesus rebuked him, saying,"
41,1,26,"At this, the unclean spirit shook the man, cried out with a loud voice, and came out of him."
41,1,27,"All the people were so stunned that they kept saying to each other, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He tells even the unclean spirits what to do, and they obey him!”"
41,1,28,"At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee."
41,1,29,"After they left the synagogue, they went directly to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John."
41,1,30,"Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed, sick with a fever, so they promptly told Jesus about her."
41,1,31,"He went up to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began serving them."
41,1,32,"When evening came, after the sun had set, people started bringing to him all those who were sick or possessed by demons."
41,1,33,"In fact, the whole city gathered at the door."
41,1,34,"He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. However, he wouldn't allow the demons to speak because they knew who he was."
41,1,35,"In the morning, while it was still very dark, Jesus got up and went to a deserted place and prayed there."
41,1,36,"Simon and his companions searched diligently for him."
41,1,37,"When they found him, they told him, “Everyone's looking for you.”"
41,1,38,"He said to them,"
41,1,39,"So he went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons."
41,1,40,"Then a leper came to Jesus and began pleading with him. He fell on his knees and said to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”"
41,1,41,"Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said to him,"
41,1,42,"Instantly the leprosy left him, and he was clean."
41,1,43,"Then Jesus sternly warned him and drove him away at once,"
41,1,44,"telling him,"
41,1,45,"But when the man left, he began to proclaim it freely. He spread the word so widely that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly, but had to stay out in deserted places. Still, people kept coming to him from everywhere."
41,2,1,"Several days later Jesus returned to Capernaum, and it was reported that he was at home."
41,2,2,"So many crowds had gathered that there wasn't any room left for them, even in front of the door. Jesus was speaking the word to them"
41,2,3,"when some people came and brought him a paralyzed man being carried by four men."
41,2,4,"Since they couldn't bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof over the place where he was. They dug through it and let down the cot on which the paralyzed man was lying."
41,2,5,"When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man,"
41,2,6,"Now some scribes were sitting there, arguing among themselves,"
41,2,7,"“Why does this man talk this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”"
41,2,8,"At once, Jesus knew in his spirit what they were saying to themselves. He said to them,"
41,2,9,""
41,2,10,""
41,2,11,""
41,2,12,"So the man got up, immediately picked up his cot, and went out before all of them.As a result, all of the people were amazed and began to glorify God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”"
41,2,13,"Jesus went out again beside the sea. The whole crowd kept coming to him, and he kept teaching them."
41,2,14,"As he was walking along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's desk. Jesus said to him,"
41,2,15,"Later he was having dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and sinners were also eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who were following him."
41,2,16,"When the scribes and the Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”"
41,2,17,"When Jesus heard that, he said to them,"
41,2,18,"Now John's disciples and the Pharisees would fast regularly. Some people came and asked Jesus, “Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but your disciples don't fast?”"
41,2,19,"Jesus said to them,"
41,2,20,""
41,2,21,""
41,2,22,""
41,2,23,"Jesus happened to be going through the grainfields on the Sabbath. As they made their way, his disciples began picking the heads of grain."
41,2,24,"The Pharisees said to him, “Look! Why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”"
41,2,25,"He said to them,"
41,2,26,""
41,2,27,"Then he said to them,"
41,2,28,""
41,3,1,"Jesus went into the synagogue again, and a man with a paralyzed hand was there."
41,3,2,"The people watched Jesus closely to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, intending to accuse him of doing something wrong."
41,3,3,"He said to the man with the paralyzed hand,"
41,3,4,"Then he asked them,"
41,3,5,"Jesus looked around at them with anger, for he was deeply hurt because of their hardness of heart. Then he said to the man,"
41,3,6,"Immediately the Pharisees, along with the Herodians, went out and began to plot against him to kill him."
41,3,7,"So Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea. A large crowd from Galilee, Judea,"
41,3,8,"Jerusalem, Idumea, from across the Jordan, and from the region around Tyre and Sidon followed him. They came to him because they kept hearing about everything he was doing."
41,3,9,"Jesus told his disciples to have a boat ready for him so that the crowd wouldn't crush him."
41,3,10,"For he had healed so many people that all who had diseases kept crowding up against him in order to touch him."
41,3,11,"Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they would fall down in front of him and scream, “You are the Son of God!”"
41,3,12,"But he sternly ordered them again and again not to tell people who he was."
41,3,13,"Then Jesus went up on a hillside and called to him those whom he wanted and they came to him."
41,3,14,"He appointed twelve whom he called apostles to accompany him, to be sent out to preach,"
41,3,15,"and to have the authority to drive out demons."
41,3,16,"He appointed these twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);"
41,3,17,"James, the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder);"
41,3,18,"Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddeus; Simon the Cananaean;"
41,3,19,"and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him."
41,3,20,"Then he went home. The crowd came together again, so that Jesus and his disciples couldn't even eat."
41,3,21,"When his family heard about it, they went to restrain him. For they kept saying, “He's out of his mind!”"
41,3,22,"The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem kept repeating, “He has Beelzebul,” and “He drives out demons by the ruler of demons.”"
41,3,23,"So Jesus called them together and began to speak to them in parables."

41,3,31,"Then his mother and his brothers arrived. They stood outside and sent word to him and called for him."
41,3,32,"A crowd was sitting around him. They said to him, “Look! Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.”"
41,3,33,"He answered them,"
41,3,34,"Then looking at the people sitting around him, he said,"
41,3,35,""
41,4,1,"Then Jesus began to teach again beside the sea. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while the entire crowd remained beside the sea on the shore."
41,4,2,"He began teaching them many things in parables. While he was teaching them he said,"

41,4,13,"Then he said to them,"

41,4,26,"He was also saying,"

41,4,28,""
41,4,29,""
41,4,30,"He was also saying,"
41,4,31,""
41,4,32,""
41,4,33,"With many other parables like these Jesus kept speaking the word to them according to their ability to understand them."
41,4,34,"He did not tell them anything without using a parable, though he explained everything to his disciples in private."
41,4,35,"That day, when evening had come, he said to them,"
41,4,36,"So they left the crowd and took him along in the boat just as he was. Other boats were with him."
41,4,37,"A violent windstorm came up, and the waves began breaking into the boat, so that the boat was rapidly becoming swamped."
41,4,38,"But Jesus was in the back of the boat, asleep on a cushion. So they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, don't you care that we're going to die?”"
41,4,39,"Then he got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,"
41,4,40,"He said to them,"
41,4,41,"They were overcome with fear and kept saying to one another, “Who is this man? Even the wind and the sea obey him!”"
41,5,1,"They arrived at the other side of the sea in the territory of the Gerasenes."
41,5,2,"Just as Jesus stepped out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs and met him."
41,5,3,"He lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him any longer, not even with a chain."
41,5,4,"He had often been restrained with shackles and chains but had snapped the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one could tame him."
41,5,5,"Night and day he kept screaming among the tombs and on the mountainsides and kept cutting himself with stones."
41,5,6,"When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell down in front of him,"
41,5,7,"screaming in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I command you in the name of God not to torture me!”"
41,5,8,"For Jesus had been saying to him,"
41,5,9,"Then Jesus asked him,"
41,5,10,"He kept pleading with Jesus not to send them out of the territory."
41,5,11,"Now a large herd of pigs was grazing on a hillside nearby."
41,5,12,"So the demons begged him, “Send us among the pigs, so that we can go into them!”"
41,5,13,"So he let them do this. The unclean spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd of about 2,000 rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned there."
41,5,14,"Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs ran away, they reported what had happened in the city and countryside. So the people went to see what had happened."
41,5,15,"When they came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there dressed and in his right mind, they were frightened."
41,5,16,"The people who had seen it told them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and the pigs."
41,5,17,"So they began to beg Jesus to leave their territory."
41,5,18,"As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed kept begging him to let him go with him."
41,5,19,"But Jesus wouldn't let him. Instead, he told him,"
41,5,20,"So the man left and began proclaiming in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And everyone was utterly amazed."
41,5,21,"When Jesus again had crossed to the other side in a boat, a large crowd gathered around him by the seashore."
41,5,22,"Then a synagogue leader named Jairus arrived. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet"
41,5,23,"and begged him urgently, saying, “My little daughter is dying. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may get well and live.”"
41,5,24,"So Jesus went with him. A huge crowd kept following him and jostling him."
41,5,25,"Now there was a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years."
41,5,26,"Although she had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all of her money, she had not been helped at all but rather grew worse."
41,5,27,"Since she had heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his robe."
41,5,28,"For she had been saying, “If I can just touch his robe, I will get well.”"
41,5,29,"Her bleeding stopped at once, and she felt in her body that she was healed from her illness."
41,5,30,"Immediately Jesus became aware that power had gone out of him. So he turned around in the crowd and asked,"
41,5,31,"His disciples said to him, “You see the crowd jostling you, and yet you ask,"
41,5,32,"But he kept looking around to see the woman who had done this."
41,5,33,"So the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him, and told him the whole truth."
41,5,34,"He said to her,"
41,5,35,"While he was still speaking, some people came from the synagogue leader's home and said, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher anymore?”"
41,5,36,"But when Jesus heard what they said, he told the synagogue leader,"
41,5,37,"Jesus allowed no one to go further with him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James."
41,5,38,"When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw mass confusion. People were crying and sobbing loudly."
41,5,39,"He entered the house and said to them,"
41,5,40,"They laughed and laughed at him. But he forced all of them outside. Then he took the child's father and mother, along with the men who were with him, and went into the room where the child was."
41,5,41,"He took her by the hand and said to her,"
41,5,42,"The little girl got up at once and started to walk, for she was twelve years old. Instantly they were overcome with astonishment."
41,5,43,"But Jesus strictly ordered them not to let anyone know about this. He also told them to give her something to eat."
41,6,1,"Jesus left that place and went back to his hometown, and his disciples followed him."
41,6,2,"When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were utterly amazed. They said, “Where did this man get all these things? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What great miracles are being done by his hands!"
41,6,3,"This is the builder, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon, isn't it? His sisters are here with us, aren't they?” And they were offended by him."
41,6,4,"Jesus was telling them,"
41,6,5,"He couldn't perform a miracle there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them."
41,6,6,"He was utterly amazed at their unbelief. Then he went around to the villages and continued teaching."
41,6,7,"He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits."
41,6,8,"He instructed them to take nothing along on the trip except a walking stick—no bread, no traveling bag, nothing in their moneybag."
41,6,9,"They could wear sandals but not take along an extra shirt."
41,6,10,"He told them repeatedly,"
41,6,11,""
41,6,12,"So they went and preached that people should repent."
41,6,13,"They also kept driving out many demons and pouring oil on many who were sick and healing them."
41,6,14,"King Herod heard about this, because Jesus’ name had become well-known. He was saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead! That's why these miracles are at work in him.”"
41,6,15,"Others were saying, “He is Elijah.” Still others were saying, “He is a prophet like one of the other prophets.”"
41,6,16,"But when Herod heard about it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised!”"
41,6,17,"For Herod himself had sent men who arrested John, bound him with chains, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. For Herod had married her."
41,6,18,"John had been telling Herod, “It's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.”"
41,6,19,"So Herodias bore a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she couldn't do it"
41,6,20,"because Herod was afraid of John. He knew that John was a righteous and holy man, and so he protected him. Whenever he listened to John, he did much of what he said. In fact, he liked listening to him."
41,6,21,"An opportunity came during Herod's birthday celebration, when he gave a banquet for his top officials, military officers, and the most important people of Galilee."
41,6,22,"When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. So the king told the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.”"
41,6,23,"He swore with an oath to her, “I'll give you anything you ask for, up to half of my kingdom.”"
41,6,24,"So she went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?”Her mother replied, “The head of John the Baptist.”"
41,6,25,"Immediately the girl hurried back to the king with her request, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”"
41,6,26,"The king was deeply saddened, yet because of his oaths and his guests he was reluctant to refuse her."
41,6,27,"So without delay the king sent a soldier and ordered him to bring John's head. The soldier went and beheaded him in prison."
41,6,28,"Then he brought John's head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother."
41,6,29,"When John's disciples heard about this, they came and carried off his body and laid it in a tomb."
41,6,30,"The apostles gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught."
41,6,31,"He said to them,"
41,6,32,"So they went away in a boat to a deserted place by themselves."
41,6,33,"But many people saw them leave and recognized them. So they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them."
41,6,34,"When he got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things."
41,6,35,"When it was quite late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a deserted place, and it's already late."
41,6,36,"Send the crowds away so that they can go to the neighboring farms and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”"
41,6,37,"But he answered them,"
41,6,38,"He asked them,"
41,6,39,"Then he ordered them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass."
41,6,40,"So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties."
41,6,41,"Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all."
41,6,42,"All of them ate and were filled."
41,6,43,"Then the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of leftover bread and fish."
41,6,44,"There were 5,000 men who had eaten the loaves."
41,6,45,"Jesus immediately had his disciples get into a boat and cross to Bethsaida ahead of him, while he sent the crowd away."
41,6,46,"After saying goodbye to them, he went up on a hillside to pray."
41,6,47,"When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, while he was alone on the land."
41,6,48,"He saw that they were straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he came to them, walking on the sea. He intended to go up right beside them,"
41,6,49,"but when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and began to scream."
41,6,50,"All of them saw him and were terrified. Immediately he said to them,"
41,6,51,"Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped blowing. The disciples were utterly astounded,"
41,6,52,"for they didn't understand the significance of the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened."
41,6,53,"When they had crossed over, they came ashore at Gennesaret and anchored the boat."
41,6,54,"As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus."
41,6,55,"They ran all over the countryside and began carrying the sick on their cots to any place where they heard he was."
41,6,56,"Wherever he went, whether into villages, towns, or farms, people would place their sick in the marketplaces and beg him to let them touch even the tassel of his garment, and all who touched it were healed."
41,7,1,"The Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus."
41,7,2,"They noticed that some of his disciples were eating with unclean hands, that is, without washing them."
41,7,3,"(For the Pharisees and indeed all the Jewish people don't eat unless they wash their hands properly, following the tradition of their elders."
41,7,4,"They don't eat anything from the marketplace unless they dip it in water. They also observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, jars, brass pots, and dinner tables.)"
41,7,5,"So the Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus, “Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with unclean hands.”"
41,7,6,"He told them,"

41,7,21,""
41,7,22,""
41,7,23,""
41,7,24,"Jesus left that place and went to the territory of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house, not wanting anyone to know he was there. However, it couldn't be kept a secret."
41,7,25,"In fact, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and came and fell down at his feet."
41,7,26,"Now the woman happened to be a Greek, born in Phoenicia in Syria. She kept asking him to drive the demon out of her daughter."
41,7,27,"But he kept telling her,"
41,7,28,"But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the puppies under the table eat some of the children's crumbs.”"
41,7,29,"Then he said to her,"
41,7,30,"So she went home and found the child lying in bed, and the demon was gone."
41,7,31,"Then Jesus left the territory of Tyre and passed through Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the territory of the Decapolis."
41,7,32,"Some people brought him a deaf man who also had a speech impediment. They begged him to lay his hand on him."
41,7,33,"Jesus took him away from the crowd to be alone with him. Putting his fingers into the man's ears, he touched his tongue with saliva."
41,7,34,"Then he looked up to heaven, sighed, and said to him,"

41,14,68,"But he denied it, saying, “I don't know or understand what you're talking about.” Then he went out into the entryway. Just then a rooster crowed."
41,14,69,"The servant girl saw him and again said to those who were standing around, “This man is one of them!”"
41,14,70,"Again he denied it.After a little while the people who were standing there began to say to Peter again, “Obviously you're one of them, because you are a Galilean!”"
41,14,71,"Then he began to invoke a divine curse and to swear with an oath, “I don't know this man you're talking about!”"
41,14,72,"Just then a rooster crowed a second time.Peter remembered that Jesus said to him,"
41,15,1,"As soon as it was morning, the high priests convened a meeting with the elders and scribes and the whole Council. They bound Jesus with chains, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate."
41,15,2,"Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”Jesus answered him,"
41,15,3,"The high priests kept accusing him of many things."
41,15,4,"So Pilate asked him again, “Don't you have any answer? Look how many accusations they're bringing against you!”"
41,15,5,"But Jesus no longer answered anything, so that Pilate was astonished."
41,15,6,"At every festival Pilate would release any one prisoner whom the people requested."
41,15,7,"Now there was a man in prison named Barabbas. He was with the insurgents who had committed murder during the rebellion."
41,15,8,"So the crowd came and began to request that he do for them what he always did."
41,15,9,"Pilate answered them, “Do you want me to release the king of the Jews for you?”"
41,15,10,"For he knew that the high priests had handed him over because of jealousy."
41,15,11,"But the high priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release Barabbas for them instead."
41,15,12,"So Pilate said to them again, “Then what should I do with the man you call the king of the Jews?”"
41,15,13,"They shouted back, “Crucify him!”"
41,15,14,"Pilate asked them, “Why? What has he done wrong?”But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”"
41,15,15,"So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified."
41,15,16,"The soldiers led Jesus into the courtyard of the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters) and called out the whole guard."
41,15,17,"They dressed him in a purple robe, twisted some thorns into a victor's crown, and placed it on his head."
41,15,18,"They began to greet him, “Long live the king of the Jews!”"
41,15,19,"They kept hitting him on the head with a stick, spitting on him, kneeling in front of him, and worshiping him."
41,15,20,"When they had finished making fun of him, they stripped him of the purple robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to crucify him."
41,15,21,"They forced a certain passer-by who was coming in from the country to carry Jesus’ cross. He was Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus."
41,15,22,"They took Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means Skull Place."
41,15,23,"They tried to give him wine mixed with myrrh, but he wouldn't take it."
41,15,24,"Then they crucified him. They divided his clothes among themselves by throwing dice to see what each one would get."
41,15,25,"It was nine in the morning when they crucified him."
41,15,26,"The written notice of the charge against him read, “The king of the Jews.”"
41,15,27,"They crucified two bandits with him, one on his right and the other on his left."
41,15,29,"Those who passed by kept insulting him, shaking their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who were going to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days—"
41,15,30,"save yourself and come down from the cross!”"
41,15,31,"In the same way the high priests, along with the scribes, were also making fun of him among themselves. They kept saying, “He saved others but can't save himself!"
41,15,32,"Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down from the cross now so that we may see it and believe.” Even the men who were crucified with him kept insulting him."
41,15,33,"At twelve noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon."
41,15,34,"At three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice,"
41,15,35,"When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, “Listen! He's calling for Elijah!”"
41,15,36,"So someone ran and soaked a sponge in some sour wine. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink, saying, “Wait! Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down!”"
41,15,37,"Then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last."
41,15,38,"The curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom."
41,15,39,"When the centurion who stood facing Jesus saw how he had cried out and breathed his last, he said, “This man certainly was the Son of God!”"
41,15,40,"Now there were women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of young James and Joseph, and Salome."
41,15,41,"They used to accompany him and care for him while he was in Galilee. Many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with him were there, too."
41,15,42,"It was the Day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath. Since it was already evening,"
41,15,43,"Joseph of Arimathea, a highly respected member of the Council, who was waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus."
41,15,44,"Pilate wondered if Jesus had already died, so he summoned the centurion to ask him if he was in fact dead."
41,15,45,"When he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he let Joseph have the corpse."
41,15,46,"Joseph bought some linen cloth, took the body down, and wrapped it in the cloth. Then he laid it in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb."
41,15,47,"Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid."
41,16,1,"When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices to go and anoint Jesus."
41,16,2,"Very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had just come up, they were going to the tomb."
41,16,3,"They kept saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?”"
41,16,4,"Then they looked up and saw that the stone had been rolled away. (For it was a very large stone.)"
41,16,5,"As they went into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were utterly astonished."
41,16,6,"But he said to them, “Stop being astonished! You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised. He is not here. Look at the place where they laid him."
41,16,7,"But go and tell his disciples, especially Peter, that he is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.”"
41,16,8,"So they left the tomb and ran away, for shock and astonishment had overwhelmed them. They didn't say a thing to anyone, because they were afraid."
41,16,9,"After Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons."
41,16,10,"She went and told those who had been with him and who now were grieving and crying."
41,16,11,"When they heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, they refused to believe it."
41,16,12,"After this, he appeared in a different form to two disciples as they were walking into the country."
41,16,13,"They went back and told the others, who didn't believe them either."
41,16,14,"Finally he appeared to the eleven disciples while they were eating. He rebuked them for their unbelief and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who had seen him after he had risen."
41,16,15,"Then he said to them,"
41,16,16,""
41,16,17,""
41,16,18,""
41,16,19,"So the Lord Jesus, after talking with them, was taken up to heaven and sat down at the right hand of God."
41,16,20,"The disciples went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord kept working with them and confirming the message by the signs that accompanied it."
42,1,1,"Since many people have attempted to write an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us,"
42,1,2,"just as they were passed down to us by those who had been eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning,"
42,1,3,"I, too, have carefully investigated everything from the beginning and have decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,"
42,1,4,"so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught."
42,1,5,"In the days of King Herod of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly order of Abijah. His wife was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth."
42,1,6,"Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, and they lived blamelessly according to all of the commandments and regulations of the Lord."
42,1,7,"They had no children because Elizabeth was barren and because both of them were getting on in years."
42,1,8,"When Zechariah was serving with his division of priests in God's presence,"
42,1,9,"he was chosen by lot to go into the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense, according to the custom of the priests."
42,1,10,"And the entire congregation of people was praying outside at the time when the incense was burned."
42,1,11,"An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the incense altar."
42,1,12,"When Zechariah saw him, he was shaken, and fear overwhelmed him."
42,1,13,"But the angel said to him, “Stop being afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John."
42,1,14,"You will have joy and gladness, and many people will rejoice at his birth."
42,1,15,"For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He will never drink wine or any strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born."
42,1,16,"He will bring many of Israel's descendants back to the Lord their God."
42,1,17,"He is the one who will go before the Lord with the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and to prepare the people to be ready for the Lord.”"
42,1,18,"Then Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I know this is so? For I am an old man, and my wife is getting on in years.”"
42,1,19,"The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news."
42,1,20,"But because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at the proper time, you will become silent and unable to speak until the day this happens.”"
42,1,21,"Meanwhile, the people kept waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed in the sanctuary so long."
42,1,22,"But when he did come out, he was unable to speak to them. Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept motioning to them but remained unable to speak."
42,1,23,"When the days of his service were over, he went home."
42,1,24,"After this, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and remained in seclusion for five months. She said,"
42,1,25,"“This is what the Lord did for me when he looked favorably on me and took away my public disgrace.”"
42,1,26,"Now in the sixth month of her pregnancy, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,"
42,1,27,"to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary."
42,1,28,"The angel came to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you!”"
42,1,29,"She was startled by his statement and tried to figure out what his greeting meant."
42,1,30,"Then the angel told her, “Stop being afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God."
42,1,31,"Listen! You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus."
42,1,32,"He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his forefather David."
42,1,33,"He will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end.”"
42,1,34,"Mary asked the angel, “How can this be, since I have not had relations with a man?”"
42,1,35,"The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come over you, and the power of the Most High will cover you. Therefore, the child will be holy and will be called the Son of God."
42,1,36,"And listen! Elizabeth, your relative, has herself conceived a son in her old age. This is the sixth month for the woman who was said to be barren."
42,1,37,"For nothing is impossible for God.”"
42,1,38,"Then Mary said, “Truly I am the Lord's servant. Let everything you have said happen to me.” Then the angel left her."
42,1,39,"At this time Mary set out hurriedly for a Judean city in the hill country."
42,1,40,"She went into Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth."
42,1,41,"When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby jumped in her womb. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit"
42,1,42,"and exclaimed with a loud cry, “How blessed are you among women, and how blessed is the fruit of your womb!"
42,1,43,"Why should this happen to me, to have the mother of my Lord visit me!"
42,1,44,"For as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb jumped for joy."
42,1,45,"How blessed is this woman for believing that what was spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled!”"
42,1,46,"Then Mary said,	“My soul praises the greatness of the Lord!"
42,1,47,"My spirit exults in God, my Savior,"
42,1,48,"for he has looked favorably on his humble servant.	From now on, all generations will call me blessed,"
42,1,49,"because the Almighty has done great things for me.His name is holy."
42,1,50,"His mercy lasts from generation to generationfor those who fear him."
42,1,51,"He displayed his mighty power with his arm.	He scattered people who were proud in mind and heart."
42,1,52,"He pulled powerful rulers from their thronesand lifted up humble people."
42,1,53,"He filled hungry people with good thingsand sent rich people away with nothing."
42,1,54,"He helped his servant Israel,remembering to be merciful,"
42,1,55,"according to the promise he made to our ancestors—to Abraham and his descendants forever.”"
42,1,56,"Now Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back home."
42,1,57,"When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son."
42,1,58,"Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her."
42,1,59,"On the eighth day they went to circumcise the child. They were going to name him Zechariah after his father,"
42,1,60,"but his mother said, “Absolutely not! He must be named John.”"
42,1,61,"Their friends said to her, “None of your relatives has that name.”"
42,1,62,"So they motioned to the baby's father to see what he wanted to name him."
42,1,63,"He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And everyone was amazed."
42,1,64,"Suddenly, Zechariah's mouth was opened, his tongue was set free, and he began to speak and to praise God."
42,1,65,"Fear came over all their neighbors, and throughout the hill country of Judea all these things were being discussed."
42,1,66,"All who heard about it debated in their minds what had happened and said, “What will this child become?” For it was obvious that the hand of the Lord was with him."
42,1,67,"Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:"
42,1,68,"“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel!He has taken care of his people and has set them free."
42,1,69,"He has raised up a mighty Savior for usfrom the family of his servant David,"
42,1,70,"just as he promised long ago		through the mouth of his holy prophets"
42,1,71,"that he would save us from our enemiesand from the grip of all who hate us."
42,1,72,"He has shown mercy to our ancestorsand remembered his holy covenant,"
42,1,73,"the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham.	He granted us"
42,1,74,"deliverance from our enemies' gripso that we could serve him without fear"
42,1,75,"and be holy and righteous before him all of our days."
42,1,76,"And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High.	For you will go ahead of the Lord to prepare his ways"
42,1,77,"and to give his people the knowledge of salvationthrough the forgiveness of their sins."
42,1,78,"Because of the tender mercy of our God,the dawn from on high has broken upon us,"
42,1,79,"to shine on those who sit in darkness and in death's shadow,and to guide our feet into the way of peace.”"
42,1,80,"Now the child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit. He lived in the wilderness until the day he appeared in Israel."
42,2,1,"Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole world should be registered."
42,2,2,"This was the first registration taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria."
42,2,3,"So all the people went to their hometowns to be registered."
42,2,4,"Joseph, too, went up from the city of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was a descendant of the household and family of David."
42,2,5,"He went there to be registered with Mary, who had been promised to him in marriage and was pregnant."
42,2,6,"While they were there, the time came for her to have her baby,"
42,2,7,"and she gave birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was not any room for them in the inn."
42,2,8,"In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, watching their flock during the night."
42,2,9,"An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified."
42,2,10,"Then the angel said to them, “Stop being afraid! Listen! I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people."
42,2,11,"Today your Savior, Christ the Lord, was born in the city of David."
42,2,12,"And this will be a sign for you: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”"
42,2,13,"Suddenly a multitude of the Heavenly Army appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,"
42,2,14,"“Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to people who enjoy his favor!”"
42,2,15,"When the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let's go to Bethlehem and see what has taken place that the Lord has told us about.”"
42,2,16,"So they went quickly and found Mary and Joseph with the baby, who was lying in the manger."
42,2,17,"When they saw this, they repeated what they had been told about this child."
42,2,18,"All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them,"
42,2,19,"but Mary continued to treasure in her heart all these things and to ponder them."
42,2,20,"Then the shepherds returned to their flock, glorifying and praising God for everything they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them."
42,2,21,"After eight days had passed, the child was circumcised and named Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb."
42,2,22,"When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,"
42,2,23,"as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every firstborn son is to be designated as holy to the Lord.”"
42,2,24,"They also offered a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord: “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”"
42,2,25,"Now a man named Simeon was in Jerusalem. This man was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the one who would comfort Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him."
42,2,26,"It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die until he had seen the Lord's Christ."
42,2,27,"Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple. When the parents brought the child Jesus to do for him what was customary under the law,"
42,2,28,"Simeon took the child in his arms and praised God, saying,"
42,2,29,"“Master, now you are allowing your servant to leave in peaceaccording to your word."
42,2,30,"For my eyes have seen your salvation,"
42,2,31,"which you prepared for all people to see—"
42,2,32,"a light that will reveal salvation to the Gentiles		and bring glory to your people Israel.”"
42,2,33,"Jesus’ father and mother kept wondering at the things being said about him."
42,2,34,"Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother, “This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall or rise. He will be a sign that will be disputed,"
42,2,35,"so that the inner thoughts of many people might be revealed. Indeed, a sword will pierce your own soul, too.”"
42,2,36,"Now Anna, a prophetess, was also there. She was a descendant of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher. She was very old, having lived with her husband for seven years after her marriage,"
42,2,37,"and then as a widow for eighty-four years. She never left the temple, but continued to worship there night and day with times of fasting and prayer."
42,2,38,"Just then she came forward and began to thank God and to speak about the child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem."
42,2,39,"After doing everything required by the law of the Lord, Joseph and Mary returned to their hometown of Nazareth in Galilee."
42,2,40,"Meanwhile, the child continued to grow and to become strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God's favor was with him."
42,2,41,"Every year Jesus’ parents would go to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival."
42,2,42,"When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival as usual."
42,2,43,"When the days of the festival were over, they left for home. The young man Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it."
42,2,44,"They thought that he was in the group of travelers. After traveling for a day, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends."
42,2,45,"When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching desperately for him."
42,2,46,"Three days later they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and asking them questions."
42,2,47,"All who heard him were amazed at his intelligence and his answers."
42,2,48,"When his parents saw him, they were shocked. His mother asked him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been worried sick looking for you!”"
42,2,49,"He said to them,"
42,2,50,"But they did not understand what he said to them."
42,2,51,"Then he went down with them and returned to Nazareth; and he remained in submission to them. His mother continued to treasure all these things in her heart."
42,2,52,"Meanwhile, Jesus kept on growing in wisdom and maturity, and in favor with God and his fellow man."
42,3,1,"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Caesar Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,"
42,3,2,"and Annas and Caiaphas high priests, the word of God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness."
42,3,3,"John went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,"
42,3,4,"as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah,	“He is a voice calling out in the wilderness:‘Prepare the way for the Lord! Make his paths straight!"
42,3,5,"Every valley will be filled,and every mountain and hill will be leveled.	The crooked ways will be made straight,and the rough roads will be made smooth."
42,3,6,"Everyone will see the salvationthat God has provided.’”"
42,3,7,"John would say to the crowds that were coming out to be baptized by him, “You children of serpents! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?"
42,3,8,"Produce fruit that is consistent with repentance! Don't begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our forefather.’ For I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones!"
42,3,9,"The ax already lies against the roots of the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire.”"
42,3,10,"The crowds kept asking him, “What, then, should we do?”"
42,3,11,"He answered them, “The person who has two coats must share with the one who doesn't have any, and the person who has food must do the same.”"
42,3,12,"Even some tax collectors came to be baptized. They asked him, “Teacher, what should we do?”"
42,3,13,"He told them, “Stop collecting more money than the amount you are told to collect.”"
42,3,14,"Even some soldiers were asking him, “And what should we do?”He told them, “Never extort money from anyone by threats or blackmail, and be satisfied with your pay.”"
42,3,15,"Now the people were filled with expectation, and all of them were wondering if John was perhaps the Christ."
42,3,16,"John replied to all of them, “I am baptizing you with water, but the one who is stronger than I am is coming, and I am not worthy to untie his sandal straps. It is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
42,3,17,"His winnowing fork is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor. He will gather the grain into his barn, but he will burn the chaff with inextinguishable fire.”"
42,3,18,"With many other exhortations John continued to proclaim the good news to the people."
42,3,19,"Now Herod the tetrarch had been rebuked by John because he had married his brother's wife Herodias and because of all the evil things Herod had done."
42,3,20,"Added to all this, Herod locked John up in prison."
42,3,21,"When all the people had been baptized, Jesus, too, was baptized. While he was praying, heaven opened,"
42,3,22,"and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. Then a voice came from heaven, saying, “You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you!”"
42,3,23,"Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was (so it was thought) the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,"
42,3,24,"the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,"
42,3,25,"the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,"
42,3,26,"the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,"
42,3,27,"the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,"
42,3,28,"the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,"
42,3,29,"the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,"

42,4,1,"Then Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan. He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,"
42,4,2,"where he was being tempted by the devil for forty days. During those days he ate nothing at all, and when they were over he was hungry."
42,4,3,"The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread.”"
42,4,4,"Jesus answered him,"
42,4,5,"The devil also took him to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant."
42,4,6,"He said to Jesus, “I will give you all this authority and the glory of these kingdoms. For it has been given to me, and I give it to anyone I please."
42,4,7,"So if you will worship me, all this will be yours.”"
42,4,8,"But Jesus answered him,"
42,4,9,"The devil also took him into Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. He said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here."

42,4,11,"With their hands they will hold you up,so that you will never hit your foot against a rock.’”"
42,4,12,"Jesus answered him,"
42,4,13,"After the devil had finished tempting Jesus in every possible way, he left him until another time."
42,4,14,"Then Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Holy Spirit. Meanwhile, the news about him spread throughout the surrounding country."
42,4,15,"He began to teach in their synagogues and was continuously receiving praise from everyone."
42,4,16,"Then Jesus came to Nazareth, where he had been raised. As was his custom, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day. When he stood up to read,"
42,4,17,"the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling the scroll, he found the place where it was written,"
42,4,18,""
42,4,19,""
42,4,20,"Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him."

42,4,22,"All the people began to speak well of him and to wonder at the gracious words that flowed from his mouth. They said, “This is Joseph's son, isn't it?”"
42,4,23,"So he said to them,"
42,4,24,"He added,"
42,4,25,""
42,4,26,""
42,4,27,""
42,4,28,"All the people in the synagogue became furious when they heard this."
42,4,29,"They got up, forced Jesus out of the city, and led him to the edge of the hill on which their city was built, intending to throw him off of it."
42,4,30,"But he walked right through the middle of them and went away."
42,4,31,"Then Jesus went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and began teaching the people on the Sabbath."
42,4,32,"They were utterly amazed at his teaching, because his message was spoken with authority."
42,4,33,"In the synagogue was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. He screamed with a loud voice,"
42,4,34,"“Oh, no! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”"
42,4,35,"But Jesus rebuked him, saying,"
42,4,36,"Amazement came on all of them, and they kept saying to one another, “What kind of statement is this? For with authority and power he tells the unclean spirits what to do, and they come out!”"
42,4,37,"So news about him spread to every place in the surrounding region."
42,4,38,"Then Jesus got up to leave the synagogue and went into Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, so they asked Jesus about her."
42,4,39,"He bent over her, rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began serving them."
42,4,40,"When the sun was setting, all those who had any friends suffering from various diseases brought them to him. He placed his hands on each of them and began healing them."
42,4,41,"Even demons came out of many people, screaming, “You are the Son of God!” But Jesus rebuked them and ordered them not to speak, because they knew he was the Christ."
42,4,42,"At daybreak he left and went to a deserted place, while the crowds kept looking for him. When they came to him, they tried to keep him from leaving them."
42,4,43,"But he said to them,"
42,4,44,"So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee."
42,5,1,"One day as the crowd was pressing in on him to listen to God's word, Jesus was standing by the lake of Gennesaret."
42,5,2,"He saw two boats lying on the shore, but the fishermen had stepped out of them and were washing their nets."
42,5,3,"So Jesus got into one of the boats (the one that belonged to Simon) and asked him to push out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and began to teach the crowds from the boat."
42,5,4,"When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,"
42,5,5,"Simon answered, “Master, we have worked hard all night and caught nothing. But if you say so, I'll lower the nets.”"
42,5,6,"After the men had done this, they caught so many fish that the nets began to tear."
42,5,7,"So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats until the boats began to sink."
42,5,8,"When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus’ knees and said, “Leave me, Lord! I am a sinful man!”"
42,5,9,"For Simon and all the people who were with him were amazed at the number of fish they had caught,"
42,5,10,"and so were James and John, Zebedee's sons and Simon's partners.Then Jesus said to Simon,"
42,5,11,"So when they brought the boats to shore, they left everything and followed Jesus."
42,5,12,"One day while Jesus was in one of the cities, a man covered with leprosy saw Jesus and fell on his face, begging him, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”"
42,5,13,"So Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying,"
42,5,14,"Then Jesus ordered him,"
42,5,15,"But the news about Jesus spread even more, and many crowds began gathering to hear him and to be healed of their diseases."
42,5,16,"However, he continued his habit of retiring to deserted places and praying."
42,5,17,"One day as Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and teachers of the law happened to be sitting near by. The people had come from every village in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was present to heal them."
42,5,18,"Some men were bringing a paralyzed man on a stretcher. They were trying to take him into the house and place him in front of Jesus."
42,5,19,"When they couldn't find a way to get him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down on his stretcher through the tiles into the middle of the room, right in front of Jesus."
42,5,20,"When Jesus saw their faith, he said,"
42,5,21,"The scribes and the Pharisees began to argue among themselves, saying, “Who is this man who is uttering blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”"
42,5,22,"Because Jesus knew that they were arguing, he said to them,"
42,5,23,""
42,5,24,""
42,5,25,"So the man immediately stood up in front of them and picked up what he had been lying on. Then he went home, praising God."
42,5,26,"Amazement seized all the people, and they began to praise God. They were filled with fear and declared, “We have seen wonderful things today!”"
42,5,27,"After that, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax collector's desk. He said to him,"
42,5,28,"So Levi left everything behind, got up, and followed him."
42,5,29,"Then Levi gave a large banquet at his home for Jesus. A large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them."
42,5,30,"The Pharisees and their scribes started complaining to Jesus’ disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”"
42,5,31,"But Jesus answered them,"
42,5,32,""
42,5,33,"Then they said to him, “John's disciples frequently fast and pray, and so do those of the Pharisees. But your disciples keep right on eating and drinking.”"
42,5,34,"But Jesus said to them,"
42,5,35,""
42,5,36,"Then he told them a parable:"

42,5,39,""
42,6,1,"Once, on the second Sabbath after the first, Jesus was walking through some grainfields. His disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating them."
42,6,2,"Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”"
42,6,3,"Jesus answered them,"
42,6,4,""
42,6,5,"Then he said to them,"
42,6,6,"Once, on another Sabbath, Jesus went into a synagogue and began teaching. A man whose right hand was paralyzed was there."
42,6,7,"The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Jesus closely to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, in order to find a way of accusing him of doing something wrong."
42,6,8,"But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to the man with the paralyzed hand,"
42,6,9,"Then Jesus said to them,"
42,6,10,"He looked around at all of them and then said to the man,"
42,6,11,"The others were filled with fury and began to discuss with each other what they could do to Jesus."
42,6,12,"Now it was in those days that Jesus went to a mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night in prayer to God."
42,6,13,"When daylight came, he called his disciples and chose twelve of them, whom he also called apostles:"
42,6,14,"Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholemew,"
42,6,15,"Matthew, Thomas, James (the son of Alphaeus), Simon (who was called the Zealot),"
42,6,16,"Judas (the son of James), and Judas Iscariot (who became a traitor)."

42,7,3,"When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him to ask him to come and save his servant's life."
42,7,4,"So they went to Jesus and begged him repeatedly, “He deserves to have this done for him,"
42,7,5,"because he loves our people and built our synagogue for us.”"
42,7,6,"So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to tell Jesus, “Sir, stop troubling yourself. For I am not worthy to have you come under my roof."
42,7,7,"That's why I didn't presume to come to you. But just say the word, and let my servant be healed."
42,7,8,"For I, too, am a man under authority and have soldiers under me. I say to one ‘Go’ and he goes, to another ‘Come’ and he comes, and to my servant ‘Do this’ and he does it.”"
42,7,9,"When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said,"

42,20,2,"and asked him, “Tell us: By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”"
42,20,3,"He answered them,"
42,20,4,""
42,20,5,"They discussed this among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn't you believe him?’"
42,20,6,"But if we say, ‘From humans,’ all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.”"
42,20,7,"So they answered that they didn't know where it was from."
42,20,8,"Then Jesus told them,"
42,20,9,"Then he began to tell the people this parable:"

42,20,19,"When the scribes and the high priests realized that he had told this parable against them, they wanted to lay their hands on him at that very hour, but they were afraid of the crowd."
42,20,20,"So they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended to be honest men in order to trap him in what he would say. They wanted to hand him over to the power and authority of the governor."
42,20,21,"So they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that you don't favor any individual, but teach the way of God truthfully."
42,20,22,"Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”"
42,20,23,"But he detected their cunning and said to them,"
42,20,24,""
42,20,25,"So he said to them,"
42,20,26,"So they couldn't catch him before the people in what he said. Amazed at his answer, they became silent."
42,20,27,"Now some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus"
42,20,28,"and asked him, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no child, the man should marry the widow and have children for his brother."
42,20,29,"Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died childless."
42,20,30,"Then the second"
42,20,31,"and the third married her. In the same way, all seven died and left no children."
42,20,32,"Finally, the woman died, too."
42,20,33,"Now in the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be, since the seven had married her?”"
42,20,34,"Jesus said to them,"
42,20,35,""
42,20,36,""
42,20,37,""
42,20,38,""
42,20,39,"Then some of the scribes replied, “Teacher, you have given a fine answer.”"
42,20,40,"For they no longer dared to ask him another question."

42,21,1,"Now Jesus looked up and saw rich people dropping their gifts into the offering box."
42,21,2,"Then he saw a destitute widow drop in two small copper coins."

42,21,4,""
42,21,5,"Now while some people were talking about the temple—how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God—he said,"

42,21,8,"He said,"

42,21,37,"Now during the day he would teach in the temple, but at night he would go out and spend the night on what is called the Mount of Olives"
42,21,38,"And all the people would get up early in the morning to listen to him in the temple."
42,22,1,"Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was near."
42,22,2,"So the high priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put him to death, for they were afraid of the crowd."
42,22,3,"But Satan went into Judas called Iscariot, who belonged to the circle of the twelve."
42,22,4,"So he went off and discussed with the high priests and the temple police how he could betray him to them."
42,22,5,"They were delighted and agreed to give him money."
42,22,6,"He accepted their offer and began to look for a good opportunity to betray him to them when no crowd was present."
42,22,7,"Then the day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed."
42,22,8,"So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying,"
42,22,9,"They asked him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”"
42,22,10,"He said to them,"

42,22,12,""
42,22,13,"So they went and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal."

42,22,46,"He said to them,"
42,22,47,"While Jesus was still speaking, a crowd came up. The man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them, and he came close to Jesus to kiss him."

42,22,49,"When those who were around him saw what was about to take place, they asked, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”"
42,22,50,"Then one of them struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear."
42,22,51,"But Jesus said,"

42,22,56,"A servant girl saw him sitting by the fire, stared at him, and said, “This man was with him, too.”"
42,22,57,"But he denied it, saying, “I don't know him, woman!”"
42,22,58,"A little later a man looked at him and said, “You are one of them, too.”But Peter said, “Mister, I am not!”"
42,22,59,"About an hour later another man emphatically asserted, “This man was certainly with him, for he is a Galilean!”"
42,22,60,"But Peter said, “Mister, I don't know what you're talking about!” Just then, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed."
42,22,61,"Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord and how he had said to him,"
42,22,62,"And he went outside and cried bitterly."
42,22,63,"Then the men who were holding Jesus in custody began to make fun of him while they beat him."
42,22,64,"They blindfolded him and asked him over and over again, “Prophesy! Who is the one who hit you?”"
42,22,65,"And they kept insulting him in many other ways."
42,22,66,"As soon as day came, the elders of the people, the high priests, and the scribes assembled and brought him before their Council."
42,22,67,"They said, “If you are the Christ, tell us.”But he said to them,"
42,22,68,""
42,22,69,""
42,22,70,"Then they all asked, “Are you, then, the Son of God?”He answered them,"
42,22,71,"Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it ourselves from his own mouth!”"
42,23,1,"Then the whole crowd got up and took him to Pilate."
42,23,2,"They began to accuse him, “We found this man corrupting our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that he is the Christ, a king.”"
42,23,3,"Then Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”He answered him,"
42,23,4,"Then Pilate said to the high priests and crowds, “I do not find anything blameworthy in this man.”"
42,23,5,"But they kept insisting, “He is stirring up the people by teaching all over Judea, beginning in Galilee even to this place.”"
42,23,6,"When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean."
42,23,7,"When he learned with certainty that Jesus came from Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him off to Herod, who was in Jerusalem at that time."
42,23,8,"Now Herod was very glad to see Jesus, because he had been wanting to see him for a long time on account of what he had heard about him. He was also hoping to see some sign done by him."
42,23,9,"So he continued to question him for a long time, but Jesus gave him no answer at all."
42,23,10,"Meanwhile, the high priests and the scribes stood by and continued to accuse him vehemently."
42,23,11,"Even Herod and his soldiers treated him with contempt and made fun of him. Then he put a magnificent robe on him and sent him back to Pilate."
42,23,12,"So Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day. Before this they had been enemies."
42,23,13,"Then Pilate called the high priests, the other leaders, and the people together"
42,23,14,"and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one who turns the people against the government. And here in your presence I have examined him and have found him “Not Guilty” of the charges you make against him."
42,23,15,"Nor does Herod, for he sent him back to us. Indeed, he has done nothing to deserve death."
42,23,16,"So I will punish him and let him go.”"
42,23,17,"Now he was obligated to release someone for them at the festival."
42,23,18,"But they all shouted out together, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas for us!”"
42,23,19,"(This was a man who had been put in prison for a revolt that had taken place in the city and for murder.)"
42,23,20,"But Pilate wanted to let Jesus go, so he appealed to them again,"
42,23,21,"but they continued to shout, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”"
42,23,22,"Then he spoke to them a third time: “What has he done wrong? I have found nothing in him worthy of death. So I will punish him and let him go.”"
42,23,23,"But they kept pressing him with loud shouts, demanding that Jesus be crucified, and their shouts began to prevail."
42,23,24,"Then Pilate pronounced his sentence that their demand should be carried out."
42,23,25,"So he released the man who had been put in prison for revolt and murder—the man they continued to demand—but he let them have their way with Jesus."
42,23,26,"As they led him away, they took hold of Simon, a man from Cyrene, as he was coming in from the country, and they put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus."
42,23,27,"A large crowd of people followed him, including some women who kept beating their breasts and wailing for him."
42,23,28,"But Jesus turned to them and said,"
42,23,29,""
42,23,30,""
42,23,31,""
42,23,32,"Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with him."
42,23,33,"When they reached the place called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left."
42,23,34,"Jesus kept saying,"
42,23,35,"Meanwhile, the people stood looking on. Even the leaders were mocking him and saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, whom he has chosen!”"
42,23,36,"The soldiers also made fun of him, coming up and offering him sour wine"
42,23,37,"and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!”"
42,23,38,"There was also an inscription over him written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “This is the King of the Jews.”"
42,23,39,"Now one of the criminals hanging there kept insulting him, saying, “You are the Christ, aren't you? Save yourself and us!”"
42,23,40,"But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Aren't you afraid of God, since you are suffering the same penalty?"
42,23,41,"We have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”"
42,23,42,"Then he went on to say, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!”"
42,23,43,"Jesus said to him,"
42,23,44,"It was already about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon"
42,23,45,"because the sun had stopped shining. And the curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two."
42,23,46,"Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said,"
42,23,47,"When the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God and said, “This man certainly was righteous!”"
42,23,48,"When all the crowds who had come together for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they beat their breasts and turned back."
42,23,49,"But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, were standing at a distance watching these things."
42,23,50,"Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and righteous man—"
42,23,51,"he had not voted for their plan and action—from the Jewish town of Arimathea; and he was waiting for the kingdom of God."
42,23,52,"He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus."
42,23,53,"Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb cut in the rock, in which no one had yet been laid."
42,23,54,"It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was just beginning."
42,23,55,"So the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee, following close behind, saw the tomb and how his body was laid."
42,23,56,"Then they went back and prepared spices and perfumes, and on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment."
42,24,1,"But on the first day of the week at early dawn they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared."
42,24,2,"They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,"
42,24,3,"but when they went in, they didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus."
42,24,4,"While they were puzzling over this, two men in dazzling robes suddenly stood beside them."
42,24,5,"Because the women were terrified and were bowing their faces to the ground, the men asked them, “Why are you looking among the dead for someone who is living?"
42,24,6,"He is not here but has been raised. Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee,"
42,24,7,""
42,24,8,"Then they remembered his words."
42,24,9,"They returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and all the others."
42,24,10,"The women who told the apostles about it were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and some others."
42,24,11,"But these words seemed nonsense to them, and they wouldn't believe them."
42,24,12,"Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. He stooped down and saw only the linen cloths. Then he went home wondering about what had happened."
42,24,13,"On the same day, two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem."
42,24,14,"They were talking with each other about all these things that had taken place."
42,24,15,"While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself approached and began to walk with them,"
42,24,16,"but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him."
42,24,17,"He asked them,"
42,24,18,"The one whose name was Cleopas answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn't know what happened there these days?”"
42,24,19,"He asked them,"
42,24,20,"and how our high priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and had him crucified."
42,24,21,"But we kept hoping that he would be the one to redeem Israel. What is more, this is now the third day since these things occurred."
42,24,22,"Even some of our women have startled us! They were at the tomb early this morning"
42,24,23,"and didn't find his body there, so they came back and told us that they had actually seen a vision of angels who said he was alive."
42,24,24,"Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they didn't see him.”"
42,24,25,"Then Jesus said to them,"
42,24,26,""
42,24,27,"Then, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them all the passages of Scripture about himself."
42,24,28,"As they came near the village where they were going, he acted as though he were going on farther."
42,24,29,"But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening and the day is almost gone.” So he went in to stay with them."
42,24,30,"While he was at the table with them, he took the bread, blessed it, broke it in pieces, and gave it to them."
42,24,31,"Then their eyes were opened, and they knew who he was. And he vanished from them."
42,24,32,"Then they said to each other, “Our hearts kept burning within us as he was talking to us on the road and explaining the Scriptures to us, didn't they?”"
42,24,33,"That same hour they got up and went back to Jerusalem and found the eleven and their companions all together."
42,24,34,"They kept saying, “The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon!”"
42,24,35,"Then they themselves began to tell what had happened on the road and how he was recognized by them when he broke the bread in pieces."
42,24,36,"While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them,"
42,24,37,"They were startled and terrified, thinking they were seeing a ghost."
42,24,38,"He said to them,"
42,24,39,""
42,24,40,"After he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet."
42,24,41,"While they still could not believe it for joy and were full of amazement, he said to them,"
42,24,42,"They gave him a piece of broiled fish,"
42,24,43,"and he took it and ate it in their presence."
42,24,44,"Then he said to them,"
42,24,45,"Then he opened their minds so that they might come to understand the Scriptures."
42,24,46,"He said to them,"
42,24,47,""
42,24,48,""
42,24,49,""
42,24,50,"Then he led them out as far as Bethany, lifted up his hands, and blessed them."
42,24,51,"While he was blessing them, he parted from them and was taken up to heaven."
42,24,52,"They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy."
42,24,53,"And they were continually in the temple blessing God."
43,1,1,"In the beginning, the Word existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God."
43,1,2,"He existed in the beginning with God."
43,1,3,"Through him all things were made, and apart from him nothing was made that has been made."
43,1,4,"In him was life, and that life brought light to humanity."
43,1,5,"And the light shines on in the darkness, and the darkness has never put it out."
43,1,6,"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John."
43,1,7,"He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him."
43,1,8,"He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light."
43,1,9,"This was the true light that enlightens every person by his coming into the world."
43,1,10,"He was in the world, and the world was made through him. Yet the world did not recognize him."
43,1,11,"He came to his own creation, yet his own people did not receive him."
43,1,12,"However, to all who received him, to those believing in his name, he gave authority to become God's children,"
43,1,13,"who were born, not merely in a physical sense, or from a fleshly impulse, or from man's desire, but of God."
43,1,14,"The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. We gazed on his glory, the kind of glory that belongs to the Father's unique Son, full of grace and truth."
43,1,15,"John told the truth about him when he cried out, “This is the person about whom I said, ‘The one who comes after me ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.’”"
43,1,16,"From his fullness we have all received one gracious gift after another."
43,1,17,"For while the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."
43,1,18,"No one has ever seen God. The unique God, who is close to the Father's side, has revealed him."
43,1,19,"This was John's testimony when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”"
43,1,20,"He spoke openly and did not deny it, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”"
43,1,21,"So they asked him, “Well then, are you Elijah?”He said, “I am not.”“Are you the Prophet?”He answered, “No.”"
43,1,22,"Then they said to him, “Who are you? We must give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”"
43,1,23,"He replied,	“I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness,‘Make the way of the Lord straight,’”as the prophet Isaiah said."
43,1,24,"Now they had been sent from the Pharisees."
43,1,25,"They asked him, “Why, then, are you baptizing if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet?”"
43,1,26,"John answered them, “I am baptizing with water, but among you stands a man whom you do not know,"
43,1,27,"the one who is coming after me, whose sandal straps I am not worthy to untie.”"
43,1,28,"This happened in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing."
43,1,29,"The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"
43,1,30,"This is the one about whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.’"
43,1,31,"I didn't recognize him, but I came baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel.”"
43,1,32,"John also testified, “I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him."
43,1,33,"I didn't recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The person on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’"
43,1,34,"I have seen this and have testified that this is the Son of God.”"
43,1,35,"The next day John was standing there again with two of his disciples."
43,1,36,"As he watched Jesus walk by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”"
43,1,37,"When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus."
43,1,38,"But when Jesus turned around and saw them following, he said to them,"
43,1,39,"He told them,"
43,1,40,"Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus."
43,1,41,"Andrew first found his brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated “Christ”)."
43,1,42,"He led Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him intently and said,"
43,1,43,"The next day Jesus decided to go away into Galilee. He found Philip and said to him,"
43,1,44,"Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the hometown of Andrew and Peter."
43,1,45,"Philip found Nathaniel and told him, “We have found the man about whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote—Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”"
43,1,46,"Nathaniel said to him, “Out of Nazareth? What good can that be?”Philip told him, “Come and see!”"
43,1,47,"Jesus saw Nathaniel coming toward him and said about him,"
43,1,48,"Nathaniel said to him, “How do you know me?”Jesus answered him,"
43,1,49,"Nathaniel replied to him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”"
43,1,50,"Jesus said to him,"
43,1,51,"Then he said to him,"
43,2,1,"On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there,"
43,2,2,"and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding."
43,2,3,"When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They don't have any wine.”"
43,2,4,"Jesus said to her,"
43,2,5,"His mother told the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”"
43,2,6,"Now standing there were six stone water jars used for the Jewish rites of purification, each one holding from twenty to thirty gallons."
43,2,7,"Jesus told the servants,"
43,2,8,"Then he said to them,"
43,2,9,"When the man in charge of the banquet tasted the water that had become wine (without knowing where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called for the bridegroom"
43,2,10,"and said to him, “Everyone serves the best wine first, and the cheap kind when people are drunk. But you have kept the best wine until now!”"
43,2,11,"Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him."
43,2,12,"After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum—he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples—and they remained there for a few days."
43,2,13,"The Jewish Passover was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
43,2,14,"In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, as well as moneychangers sitting at their tables."
43,2,15,"Making a whip out of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, including the sheep and the cattle. He scattered the coins of the moneychangers and knocked over their tables."
43,2,16,"Then he told those who were selling the doves,"
43,2,17,"His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”"
43,2,18,"Then the Jews said to him, “What sign can you show us as authority for doing these things?”"
43,2,19,"Jesus answered them,"
43,2,20,"The Jews said, “This sanctuary has been under construction for forty-six years, and you're going to rebuild it in three days?”"
43,2,21,"But the sanctuary he was speaking about was his own body."
43,2,22,"After he had been raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this. So they believed the Scripture and the statement that Jesus had made."
43,2,23,"While Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Festival, many people believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing."
43,2,24,"Jesus, however, did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people"
43,2,25,"and didn't need anyone to tell him what people were like. For he himself knew what was in every person."
43,3,1,"Now there was a man from the Pharisees, a leader of the Jews, whose name was Nicodemus."
43,3,2,"He came to Jesus at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, for no one can perform these signs that you are doing unless God is with him.”"
43,3,3,"Jesus replied to him,"
43,3,4,"Nicodemus said to him, “How can a person be born when he is old? He can't go back into his mother's womb a second time and be born, can he?”"
43,3,5,"Jesus answered,"
43,3,6,""
43,3,7,""
43,3,8,""
43,3,9,"Nicodemus said to him, “How can that be?”"

43,3,21,""
43,3,22,"After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside. He spent some time there with them and began baptizing."
43,3,23,"John was also baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. People kept coming and were being baptized,"
43,3,24,"since John had not yet been thrown into prison."
43,3,25,"Then a controversy about ritual purification sprang up between John's disciples and a certain Jew."
43,3,26,"They went to John and told him, “Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one about whom you testified—look, he's baptizing, and all are going to him!”"
43,3,27,"John replied, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven."
43,3,28,"You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of him.’"
43,3,29,"It is the bridegroom who gets the bride, yet the bridegroom's friend, who merely stands by and listens for him, is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom's voice. That's why this joy of mine is now complete."
43,3,30,"He must become more important, but I must become less important.”"
43,3,31,"The one who comes from above is over everything. The one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is over everything."
43,3,32,"He testifies about what he has seen and heard, yet no one accepts his testimony."
43,3,33,"The person who has accepted his testimony has acknowledged that God is truthful."
43,3,34,"For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God, because God does not give the Spirit in limited measure."
43,3,35,"The Father loves the Son and has put everything in his hands."
43,3,36,"The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath of God remains on him."
43,4,1,"Now when Jesus realized that the Pharisees had heard he was making and baptizing more disciples than John—"
43,4,2,"although it was not Jesus who did the baptizing but his disciples—"
43,4,3,"he left Judea and went back to Galilee."
43,4,4,"Now it was necessary for him to go through Samaria."
43,4,5,"So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph."
43,4,6,"Jacob's Well was also there, and Jesus, tired out by the journey, sat down by the well. It was about twelve noon."
43,4,7,"A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her,"
43,4,8,"For his disciples had gone off into town to buy food."
43,4,9,"The Samaritan woman said to him, “How can you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” For Jews do not have anything to do with Samaritans."
43,4,10,"Jesus answered her,"
43,4,11,"The woman said to him, “Sir, you don't have a bucket, and the well is deep. Where are you going to get this living water?"
43,4,12,"You're not greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it, along with his sons and his flocks, are you?”"
43,4,13,"Jesus answered her,"
43,4,14,""
43,4,15,"The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I won't get thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.”"
43,4,16,"He said to her,"
43,4,17,"The woman answered him, “I don't have a husband.”Jesus said to her,"
43,4,18,""
43,4,19,"The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet!"
43,4,20,"Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain. But you Jews say that the place where people should worship is in Jerusalem.”"
43,4,21,"Jesus said to her,"
43,4,22,""
43,4,23,""
43,4,24,""
43,4,25,"The woman said to him, “I know that the Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When he comes, he will tell us everything.”"
43,4,26,"Jesus said to her,"
43,4,27,"At this point his disciples arrived, and they were amazed that he was talking to a woman. Yet no one said, “What do you want from her?” or, “Why are you talking to her?”"
43,4,28,"Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town. She told the people,"
43,4,29,"“Come and see a man who told me everything I've ever done! Could he possibly be the Christ?”"
43,4,30,"The people left the town and started on their way to him."
43,4,31,"Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, have something to eat.”"
43,4,32,"But he said to them,"
43,4,33,"So the disciples began to say to one another, “No one has brought him anything to eat, has he?”"
43,4,34,"Jesus told them,"
43,4,35,""
43,4,36,""
43,4,37,""
43,4,38,""
43,4,39,"Now many of the Samaritans of that town believed in Jesus because of the woman's testimony when she testified, “He told me everything I've ever done.”"
43,4,40,"So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there for two days."
43,4,41,"And many more believed because of his word."
43,4,42,"They kept telling the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that he really is the Savior of the world.”"
43,4,43,"Two days later, Jesus went from that place to Galilee."
43,4,44,"For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country."
43,4,45,"When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the festival. For they, too, had gone to the festival."
43,4,46,"So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Meanwhile, in Capernaum there was a government official whose son was ill."
43,4,47,"When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him repeatedly to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die."
43,4,48,"Jesus told him,"
43,4,49,"The official said to him, “Sir, please come down before my little boy dies.”"
43,4,50,"Jesus said to him,"
43,4,51,"While he was on his way down, his servants met him and told him that his child was alive."
43,4,52,"So he asked them at what hour he had begun to recover, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at one o'clock in the afternoon.”"
43,4,53,"Then the father realized that this was the very hour when Jesus had told him,"
43,4,54,"Now this was the second sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee."
43,5,1,"Later on, there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
43,5,2,"Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem is a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew. It has five colonnades,"
43,5,3,"and under these a large number of sick people were lying—blind, lame, or paralyzed—waiting for the movement of the water."
43,5,4,"For at certain times an angel of the Lord would go down into the pool and stir up the water. And the one who stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had."
43,5,5,"One particular man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years."
43,5,6,"When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him,"
43,5,7,"The sick man answered him, “Sir, I don't have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I'm trying to get there, someone else steps down ahead of me.”"
43,5,8,"Jesus said to him,"
43,5,9,"The man immediately became well, and he picked up his mat and started walking. Now that day was a Sabbath."
43,5,10,"So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.”"
43,5,11,"But he answered them, “The man who made me well told me,"
43,5,12,"They asked him, “Who is the man who told you,"
43,5,13,"But the one who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away from the crowd in that place."
43,5,14,"Later on, Jesus found him in the temple and told him,"
43,5,15,"The man went off and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well."
43,5,16,"So the Jews began persecuting Jesus because he kept doing such things on the Sabbath."
43,5,17,"But Jesus answered them,"
43,5,18,"So the Jews were trying all the harder to kill him, because he was not only breaking the Sabbath but was also calling God his own Father, thus making himself equal to God."
43,5,19,"Jesus said to them,"

43,6,1,"After this, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias)."
43,6,2,"A large crowd kept following him because they had seen the signs that he was performing on the sick."
43,6,3,"But Jesus went up on a hillside and sat down there with his disciples."
43,6,4,"Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near."
43,6,5,"When Jesus looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming toward him, he said to Philip,"
43,6,6,"Jesus said this to test him, for he himself knew what he was going to do."
43,6,7,"Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough for each of them to get a little.”"
43,6,8,"One of his disciples, Andrew, who was Simon Peter's brother, said to him,"
43,6,9,"“There's a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish. But what are they among so many people?”"
43,6,10,"Jesus said,"
43,6,11,"Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated. He also distributed the fish, as much as they wanted."
43,6,12,"When they were completely satisfied, he told his disciples,"
43,6,13,"So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten."
43,6,14,"When the people saw the sign that he had done, they kept saying, “Truly this is the Prophet who was to come into the world!”"
43,6,15,"Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, withdrew again to the hillside by himself."
43,6,16,"When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,"
43,6,17,"got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. Darkness had already fallen, and Jesus had not yet come to them."
43,6,18,"A strong wind was blowing, and the sea was getting rough."
43,6,19,"They had rowed about three or four miles when they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat. They became terrified."
43,6,20,"But he said to them,"
43,6,21,"So they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going."
43,6,22,"The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea noticed that only one boat had been there, and no other, and that Jesus had not gotten into that boat with his disciples. Instead, his disciples had gone away by themselves."
43,6,23,"Other small boats from Tiberias arrived near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks."
43,6,24,"When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into these boats and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus."
43,6,25,"When they had found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”"
43,6,26,"Jesus replied to them,"
43,6,27,""
43,6,28,"Then they said to him, “What must we do to perform the works of God?”"

43,6,65,"So he said,"

43,7,1,"After this, Jesus traveled about in Galilee, for he didn't want to travel in Judea because the Jews were trying to kill him."
43,7,2,"Now the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was approaching."
43,7,3,"So his brothers said to him, “You should leave this place and go to Judea, so that your disciples can see the works that you're doing."

43,7,13,"No one, however, would speak openly about him for fear of the Jews."
43,7,14,"Halfway through the festival, Jesus went up to the temple and began teaching."

43,7,27,"We know where this man comes from. But when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”"
43,7,28,"At this point Jesus, still teaching in the temple, shouted,"
43,7,29,""
43,7,30,"Then they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come."

43,7,38,""
43,7,39,"Now he said this about the Spirit, whom those who were believing in him were to receive. For the Spirit was not yet present, because Jesus had not yet been glorified."

43,7,41,"while others were saying, “This is the Christ!”But some were saying, “The Christ doesn't come from Galilee, does he?"
43,7,42,"Doesn't the Scripture say that the Christ is from David's family and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?”"
43,7,43,"So there was a division in the crowd because of him."
43,7,44,"Some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid hands on him."
43,7,45,"Then the officers returned to the high priests and Pharisees, who said to them, “Why didn't you bring him?”"
43,7,46,"The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like that!”"

43,7,48,"None of the authorities or Pharisees has believed in him, has he?"
43,7,49,"But this mob that does not know the law—they are accursed!”"
43,7,50,"One of their number, Nicodemus (the man who had previously gone to him), said to them,"
43,7,51,"“Surely our law does not condemn a person without first hearing from him and finding out what he is doing, does it?”"
43,7,52,"They answered him, “You aren't from Galilee, too, are you? Search and see that no prophet comes from Galilee.”"
43,7,53,"Then each of them went to his own home."
43,8,1,"Jesus, however, went to the Mount of Olives."
43,8,2,"At daybreak he appeared again in the temple, and all the people came to him. So he sat down and began to teach them."
43,8,3,"But the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery. After setting her before them,"
43,8,4,"they said to him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the very act of adultery."
43,8,5,"Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women to death. What do you say?”"
43,8,6,"They said this to test him, so that they might have a charge against him. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger."
43,8,7,"When they persisted in questioning him, he straightened up and said to them,"
43,8,8,"Then he bent down again and continued writing on the ground."
43,8,9,"When they heard this, they went away one by one, beginning with the oldest, and he was left alone with the woman standing there."
43,8,10,"Then Jesus stood up and said to her,"
43,8,11,"She said, “No one, sir.”Then Jesus said,"
43,8,12,"Later on Jesus spoke to them again, saying,"
43,8,13,"The Pharisees said to him, “You are testifying about yourself. Your testimony is not valid.”"

43,8,21,"Later on he said to them again,"
43,8,22,"So the Jews said, “He isn't going to kill himself, is he? Is that why he said,"
43,8,23,"He said to them,"
43,8,24,""
43,8,25,"Then they said to him, “Who are you?”Jesus told them,"
43,8,26,""
43,8,27,"They didn't realize that he was talking to them about the Father."
43,8,28,"So Jesus told them,"
43,8,29,""
43,8,30,"While he was saying these things, many believed in him."
43,8,31,"So Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in him,"
43,8,32,""
43,8,33,"They replied to him, “We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves to anybody. So how can you say,"
43,8,34,"Jesus answered them,"
43,8,35,""
43,8,36,""
43,8,37,""
43,8,38,""
43,8,39,"They replied to him, “Our father is Abraham!”Jesus said to them,"
43,8,40,""
43,8,41,""
43,8,42,"Jesus told them,"
43,8,43,""
43,8,44,""
43,8,45,""
43,8,46,""
43,8,47,""
43,8,48,"The Jews replied to him, “Surely we are right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon, aren't we?”"
43,8,49,"Jesus answered,"
43,8,50,""
43,8,51,""
43,8,52,"Then the Jews said to him, “Now we really know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and so did the prophets, but you say,"
43,8,53,"You aren't greater than our father Abraham, who died, are you? The prophets also died. Who are you making yourself out to be?”"
43,8,54,"Jesus answered,"
43,8,55,""
43,8,56,""
43,8,57,"Then the Jews said to him, “You are not even fifty years old, yet you have seen Abraham?”"
43,8,58,"Jesus said to them,"
43,8,59,"At this, they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple."
43,9,1,"As he was walking along, he observed a man who had been blind from birth."
43,9,2,"His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that caused him to be born blind?”"
43,9,3,"Jesus answered,"
43,9,4,""
43,9,5,""
43,9,6,"After saying this, he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he spread the mud on the man's eyes"
43,9,7,"and told him,"
43,9,8,"Then the neighbors and those who had previously seen him as a beggar said, “This is the man who used to sit and beg, isn't it?”"
43,9,9,"Some were saying, “It is he,” while others were saying, “No, but it is someone like him.”He himself kept saying, “It is I!”"
43,9,10,"So they said to him, “How, then, were your eyes opened?”"
43,9,11,"He said, “The man named Jesus made some mud, spread it on my eyes, and told me,"
43,9,12,"They said to him, “Where is that man?”He said, “I don't know!”"
43,9,13,"So they brought to the Pharisees the man who had once been blind."
43,9,14,"Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes."
43,9,15,"So the Pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight. He told them, “He put mud on my eyes, then I washed, and now I can see.”"
43,9,16,"Some of the Pharisees began to remark, “This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath.”But others were saying, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?” And there was a division among them."
43,9,17,"So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him, for it was your eyes he opened?”He said, “He is a prophet.”"
43,9,18,"The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had been given sight until they summoned his parents"
43,9,19,"and asked them, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? How does he now see?”"
43,9,20,"His parents replied, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind."
43,9,21,"But we don't know how it is that he now sees, and we don't know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is of age and can speak for himself.”"
43,9,22,"His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be thrown out of the synagogue."
43,9,23,"That's why his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”"
43,9,24,"So for a second time they summoned the man who had been blind and told him, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.”"
43,9,25,"But he responded, “I don't know whether he is a sinner or not. The one thing I do know is that I used to be blind and now I can see!”"
43,9,26,"Then they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”"
43,9,27,"He answered them, “I've already told you, but you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't want to become his disciples, too, do you?”"
43,9,28,"At this, they turned on him furiously and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses!"
43,9,29,"We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this fellow comes from.”"
43,9,30,"The man answered them, “This is an amazing thing! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes."
43,9,31,"We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but he does listen to anyone who worships him and does his will."
43,9,32,"Never since creation has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man who was born blind."
43,9,33,"If this man were not from God, he couldn't do anything like that.”"
43,9,34,"They said to him, “You were born entirely in sins, and you are trying to instruct us?” And they threw him out."
43,9,35,"Jesus heard that they had thrown him out. So when he found him, he said,"
43,9,36,"He answered, “And who is he, sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.”"
43,9,37,"Jesus said to him,"
43,9,38,"He said, “Lord, I do believe,” and worshiped him."
43,9,39,"Then Jesus said,"
43,9,40,"Some of the Pharisees who were near him overheard this and said to him, “We aren't blind, too, are we?”"
43,9,41,"Jesus told them,"
43,10,1,""
43,10,2,""
43,10,3,""
43,10,4,""
43,10,5,""
43,10,6,"Jesus used this illustration with them, but they didn't understand what he was saying to them."
43,10,7,"So again Jesus said,"
43,10,8,""
43,10,9,""
43,10,10,""
43,10,11,""
43,10,12,""
43,10,13,""
43,10,14,""
43,10,15,""
43,10,16,""
43,10,17,""
43,10,18,""
43,10,19,"Once again there was a division among the Jews because of these words."
43,10,20,"Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is insane. Why bother listening to him?”"
43,10,21,"Others were saying, “These are not the words of a man who is demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can it?”"
43,10,22,"Now Hanukkah was taking place in Jerusalem. It was winter,"
43,10,23,"and Jesus was walking around in the temple inside the open porch of Solomon."
43,10,24,"So the Jews surrounded him and said to him, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so plainly.”"
43,10,25,"Jesus answered them,"
43,10,26,""
43,10,27,""
43,10,28,""
43,10,29,""
43,10,30,""
43,10,31,"Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him to death."
43,10,32,"Jesus replied to them,"
43,10,33,"The Jews answered him, “We are not going to stone you for a good work but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, are making yourself God!”"
43,10,34,"Jesus replied to them,"
43,10,35,""
43,10,36,""
43,10,37,""
43,10,38,""
43,10,39,"Again they tried to seize him, but he slipped away out of their hands."
43,10,40,"Then he went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and he remained there."
43,10,41,"Many people came to him and kept saying, “John never performed a sign, but all the things that John said about this man were true!”"
43,10,42,"And many believed in him there."
43,11,1,"Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha."
43,11,2,"Mary was the woman who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair. Her brother Lazarus was the one who was ill."
43,11,3,"So the sisters sent word to Jesus, saying, “Lord, the one whom you love is ill.”"
43,11,4,"But when Jesus heard it, he said,"
43,11,5,"Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus."
43,11,6,"Yet, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed where he was for two days."
43,11,7,"After this he said to the disciples,"
43,11,8,"The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now trying to stone you to death, and you are going back there again?”"
43,11,9,"Jesus replied,"
43,11,10,""
43,11,11,"These were the things he said. Then after this he told them,"
43,11,12,"So the disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.”"
43,11,13,"Jesus, however, had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was speaking about resting or sleeping."
43,11,14,"Then Jesus told them plainly,"
43,11,15,""
43,11,16,"Then Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let's go, too, so that we may die with him!”"
43,11,17,"When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days."
43,11,18,"Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away,"
43,11,19,"and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them about their brother."
43,11,20,"As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary stayed at home."
43,11,21,"Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
43,11,22,"But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give it to you.”"
43,11,23,"Jesus told her,"
43,11,24,"Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”"
43,11,25,"Jesus said to her,"
43,11,26,""
43,11,27,"She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one who was to come into the world.”"
43,11,28,"When she had said this, she went away and called her sister Mary and told her privately, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you!”"
43,11,29,"As soon as Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him."
43,11,30,"Now Jesus had not yet arrived at the village but was still at the place where Martha had met him."
43,11,31,"When the Jews who had been with her, consoling her in the house, saw Mary get up quickly and go out, they followed her, thinking that she had gone to the tomb to cry there."
43,11,32,"As soon as Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”"
43,11,33,"When Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who had come with her crying, he was greatly troubled in spirit and deeply moved."
43,11,34,"He said,"
43,11,35,"Jesus burst into tears."
43,11,36,"So the Jews said, “See how much he loved him!”"
43,11,37,"But some of them said, “Surely the one who opened the eyes of the blind man could have kept this man from dying, couldn't he?”"
43,11,38,"Groaning deeply again, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it."
43,11,39,"Jesus said,"
43,11,40,"Jesus said to her,"
43,11,41,"So they removed the stone.Then Jesus looked upward and said,"
43,11,42,""
43,11,43,"After saying this, he shouted with a loud voice,"
43,11,44,"The dead man came out, his hands and feet tied with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus told them,"
43,11,45,"Many of the Jews who had come with Mary and had observed what Jesus did believed in him."
43,11,46,"Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done."
43,11,47,"So the high priests and the Pharisees assembled the Council and said, “What are we going to do? This man is performing many signs."
43,11,48,"If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our temple and our nation.”"
43,11,49,"But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, told them, “You don't know anything!"
43,11,50,"You don't realize that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed.”"
43,11,51,"Now he did not say this on his own initiative. As high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,"
43,11,52,"and not only for the nation, but that he would also gather into one the children of God who were scattered abroad."
43,11,53,"So from that day on they resolved to put him to death."
43,11,54,"As a result, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews. Instead, he went from there to a town called Ephraim in the region near the wilderness. There he remained with his disciples."
43,11,55,"Now the Jewish Passover was approaching, and before the Passover many people from the countryside went up to Jerusalem to purify themselves."
43,11,56,"They kept looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? Surely he won't come to the festival, will he?”"
43,11,57,"Now the high priests and the Pharisees had given orders that whoever knew where he was should tell them so that they could arrest him."
43,12,1,"Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived in Bethany, where Lazarus lived, the man whom Jesus had raised from the dead."
43,12,2,"There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him."
43,12,3,"Mary took a pound of very expensive perfume made of pure nard and anointed Jesus’ feet. She wiped his feet with her hair, and the house became filled with the fragrance of the perfume."
43,12,4,"But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who was going to betray him, said,"
43,12,5,"“Why wasn't this perfume sold for 300 denarii and the money given to the destitute?”"
43,12,6,"He said this, not because he cared about the destitute, but because he was a thief. He was in charge of the moneybag and would steal what was put into it."
43,12,7,"Then Jesus said,"
43,12,8,""
43,12,9,"When the large crowd of Jews realized that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead."
43,12,10,"So the high priests planned to kill Lazarus, too,"
43,12,11,"since he was the reason why so many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus."
43,12,12,"The next day the large crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem."
43,12,13,"So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting,	“Hosanna!	How blessed is the one who comesin the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!”"
43,12,14,"Then Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written:"
43,12,15,"“Stop being afraid, daughter of Zion.	Look, your king is coming,sitting upon a donkey's colt!”"
43,12,16,"At first his disciples didn't understand these things. However, when Jesus had been glorified, they remembered that these things had been written about him and that people had done these things to him."
43,12,17,"So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify to what they had seen."
43,12,18,"This accounts for the crowd going out to meet him, for they had heard that he had performed this sign."
43,12,19,"Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You see, there is nothing you can do. Look, the world has gone after him!”"
43,12,20,"Now some Greeks were among those who had come up to worship at the festival."
43,12,21,"They went to Philip (who was from Bethsaida in Galilee) and told him, “Sir, we would like to see Jesus.”"
43,12,22,"Philip went and told Andrew, and Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus."
43,12,23,"Jesus said to them,"
43,12,24,""
43,12,25,""
43,12,26,""
43,12,27,""
43,12,28,""
43,12,29,"The crowd standing there heard this and said that it was thunder. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him.”"
43,12,30,"Jesus replied, “"
43,12,31,""
43,12,32,""
43,12,33,"He said this to indicate the kind of death he was about to die."
43,12,34,"Then the crowd answered him, “We have learned from the law that the Christ remains forever. So how can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”"
43,12,35,"Jesus said to them,"
43,12,36,""
43,12,37,"Although he had performed numerous signs in their presence, they did not believe in him,"
43,12,38,"so that the word that the prophet Isaiah spoke might be fulfilled when he said:	“Lord, who has believed our message,and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”"
43,12,39,"For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah also said,"
43,12,40,"“He has blinded their eyesand hardened their heart,	so that they might not perceive with their eyes,and understand with their heart and turn,and I would heal them.”"
43,12,41,"Isaiah said this when he saw his glory and spoke about him."
43,12,42,"Yet many people, even some of the authorities, believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not admit it for fear that they would be thrown out of the synagogue."
43,12,43,"For they loved the praise of people more than the praise of God."
43,12,44,"Then Jesus said loudly,"

43,13,1,"Now before the Passover Festival, Jesus realized that his hour had come to leave this world and return to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end."
43,13,2,"By supper time, the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray him."
43,13,3,"Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was returning to God,"
43,13,4,"got up from the table, removed his outer robe, and took a towel and fastened it around his waist."
43,13,5,"Then he poured some water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel that was tied around his waist."
43,13,6,"Then he came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”"
43,13,7,"Jesus answered him,"
43,13,8,"Peter said to him, “You must never wash my feet!”Jesus answered him,"
43,13,9,"Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not just my feet, but my hands and my head as well!”"
43,13,10,"Jesus told him,"
43,13,11,"For he knew who was going to betray him. That's why he said,"

43,18,1,"After Jesus had said this, he went with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered."
43,18,2,"Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place because Jesus often met there with his disciples."
43,18,3,"So Judas took a detachment of soldiers and some officers from the high priests and the Pharisees and went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons."
43,18,4,"Then Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen, went forward and said to them,"
43,18,5,"They answered him, “Jesus from Nazareth.”Jesus said to them,"
43,18,6,"When Jesus told them,"
43,18,7,"So he asked them again,"
43,18,8,"Jesus replied,"
43,18,9,"This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken,"
43,18,10,"Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus."
43,18,11,"Jesus told Peter,"
43,18,12,"Then the soldiers, along with their commander and the Jewish officers, arrested Jesus and tied him up."
43,18,13,"First they brought him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year."
43,18,14,"Caiaphas was the person who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one man die for the people."
43,18,15,"Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Since the other disciple was known to the high priest, he accompanied Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest."
43,18,16,"Peter, however, stood outside the gate. So this other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter inside."
43,18,17,"The young woman at the gate said to Peter, “You aren't one of this man's disciples, too, are you?”He said, “I am not.”"
43,18,18,"Meanwhile, the servants and officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had built and were warming themselves because it was cold. Peter was also standing with them, keeping himself warm."
43,18,19,"Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his own teaching."
43,18,20,"Jesus answered him,"
43,18,21,""
43,18,22,"When he said this, one of the officers standing nearby slapped Jesus on the face and said, “Is that any way to answer the high priest?”"
43,18,23,"Jesus answered him,"
43,18,24,"Then Annas sent him, with his hands tied, to Caiaphas the high priest."
43,18,25,"Meanwhile, Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, “You aren't one of his disciples, too, are you?”He denied it by saying, “I am not!”"
43,18,26,"Then one of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “I saw you in the garden with him, didn't I?”"
43,18,27,"Peter again denied it, and immediately a rooster crowed."
43,18,28,"Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters. It was early in the morning, and the Jews did not go into the headquarters for fear that they might become unclean and be unable to eat the Passover meal."
43,18,29,"So Pilate came out to them and said, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?”"
43,18,30,"They answered him, “If he weren't a criminal, we wouldn't have handed him over to you.”"
43,18,31,"Pilate told them, “You take him and try him according to your law.”The Jews said to him, “It is not legal for us to put anyone to death.”"
43,18,32,"This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die."
43,18,33,"So Pilate went back into the governor's headquarters, summoned Jesus, and said to him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”"
43,18,34,"Jesus replied,"
43,18,35,"Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, am I? It is your own nation and high priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?”"
43,18,36,"Jesus answered,"
43,18,37,"Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?”Jesus answered,"
43,18,38,"Pilate said to him, “What is ‘truth’?” After he said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, “I find no basis for a charge against him."
43,18,39,"But you have a custom that I release one person for you at Passover. Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?”"
43,18,40,"At this, they shouted out again, “Not this fellow, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a revolutionary."
43,19,1,"Then Pilate had Jesus taken away and whipped."
43,19,2,"The soldiers twisted some thorns into a victor's crown, put it on his head, and threw a purple robe on him."
43,19,3,"They kept coming up to him and saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!” Then they began to slap him on the face."
43,19,4,"Pilate went outside again and told the Jews, “Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.”"
43,19,5,"Then Jesus came outside, wearing the victor's crown of thorns and the purple robe.Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”"
43,19,6,"When the high priests and the officials saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”Pilate told them, “You take him and crucify him. I find no basis for a charge against him.”"
43,19,7,"The Jews answered Pilate, “We have a law, and according to that law he must die because he made himself out to be the Son of God.”"
43,19,8,"When Pilate heard this, he became even more afraid."
43,19,9,"Returning to his headquarters, he said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no reply."
43,19,10,"So Pilate said to him, “Aren't you going to speak to me? You realize, don't you, that I have the authority to release you and the authority to crucify you?”"
43,19,11,"Jesus answered him,"
43,19,12,"From then on, Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this fellow, you're not a friend of Caesar! Anyone who claims to be a king is defying Caesar!”"
43,19,13,"When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in a place called The Pavement, which in Hebrew is called Gabbatha."
43,19,14,"Now it was the Preparation Day for the Passover, about twelve noon. He said to the Jews, “Here is your king!”"
43,19,15,"Then they shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!”Pilate said to them, “Should I crucify your king?”The high priests responded, “We have no king but Caesar!”"
43,19,16,"Then Pilate handed him over to be crucified, and they took Jesus away."
43,19,17,"Carrying the cross all by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of a Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha."
43,19,18,"There they crucified him, along with two others, one on each side of him with Jesus in the middle."
43,19,19,"Pilate wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, “Jesus from Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”"
43,19,20,"Many Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. It was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek."
43,19,21,"Then the Jewish high priests told Pilate, “Don't write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that this fellow said,"
43,19,22,"Pilate replied, “What I have written I have written.”"
43,19,23,"When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier, and took his cloak as well. The cloak was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down."
43,19,24,"So they said to each other, “Let's not tear it. Instead, let's throw dice to see who gets it.” This was to fulfill the Scripture that says,	“They divided my clothes among themselves,and for my clothing they threw dice.”So that is what the soldiers did."
43,19,25,"Meanwhile, standing near Jesus’ cross were his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene."
43,19,26,"When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he kept loving standing there, he said to his mother,"
43,19,27,"Then he said to the disciple,"
43,19,28,"After this, when Jesus realized that everything was now completed, he said (in order to fulfill the Scripture),"
43,19,29,"A jar of sour wine was standing there, so they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth."
43,19,30,"After Jesus had taken the wine, he said,"
43,19,31,"Since it was the Preparation Day, the Jews did not want to leave the bodies on the crosses during the Sabbath, for that was a particularly important Sabbath. So they asked Pilate to have the men's legs broken and the bodies removed."
43,19,32,"So the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man and then of the other man who had been crucified with him."
43,19,33,"But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs."
43,19,34,"Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately came out."
43,19,35,"The one who saw this has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows he is telling the truth so that you, too, may believe."
43,19,36,"For these things happened so that the Scripture might be fulfilled: 	“None of his bones will be broken.”"
43,19,37,"In addition, another passage of Scripture says, 	“They will look on the one whom they pierced.”"
43,19,38,"Later on, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (though a secret one because he was afraid of the Jews), asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, and he came and removed his body."
43,19,39,"Nicodemus, the man who had first come to Jesus at night, also arrived, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds."
43,19,40,"They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths along with spices, according to the burial custom of the Jews."
43,19,41,"A garden was located in the place where he was crucified, and in that garden was a new tomb in which no one had yet been placed."
43,19,42,"Because it was the Jewish Preparation Day, and because the tomb was nearby, they put Jesus there."
43,20,1,"On the first day of the week, early in the morning and while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and noticed that the stone had been removed from the tomb."
43,20,2,"So she ran off and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus kept loving. She told them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!”"
43,20,3,"So Peter and the other disciple set out to go to the tomb."
43,20,4,"The two of them were running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and came to the tomb first."
43,20,5,"Bending over to look inside, he noticed the linen cloths lying there but didn't go in."
43,20,6,"At this point Simon Peter arrived, following him, and went straight into the tomb. He observed that the linen cloths were lying there,"
43,20,7,"and that the handkerchief that had been on Jesus’ head was not lying with the linen cloths but was rolled up in a separate place."
43,20,8,"Then the other disciple, who arrived at the tomb first, went inside, looked, and believed."
43,20,9,"For they did not yet understand the Scripture that said that he had to rise from the dead."
43,20,10,"So the disciples went back to their homes."
43,20,11,"Meanwhile, Mary stood crying outside the tomb. As she cried, she bent over and looked into the tomb."
43,20,12,"She saw two angels in white clothes who were sitting down, one at the head and the other at the foot of the place where Jesus’ body had been lying."
43,20,13,"They said to her, “Woman, why are you crying?”She told them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know where they have put him.”"
43,20,14,"After she had said this, she turned around and noticed Jesus standing there, without realizing that it was Jesus."
43,20,15,"Jesus said to her,"
43,20,16,"Jesus said to her,"
43,20,17,"Jesus told her,"
43,20,18,"So Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” She also told them what he had said to her."
43,20,19,"It was the evening of the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked because they were afraid of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them. He said to them,"
43,20,20,"After saying this, he showed them his hands and his side, and when they saw the Lord the disciples were overjoyed."
43,20,21,"Jesus said to them again,"
43,20,22,"When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them,"
43,20,23,""
43,20,24,"Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called the Twin, wasn't with them when Jesus came."
43,20,25,"So the other disciples kept telling him, “We have seen the Lord!”But he told them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands, put my finger into them, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe!”"
43,20,26,"A week later his disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were shut, Jesus came, stood among them, and said,"
43,20,27,"Then he said to Thomas,"
43,20,28,"Thomas answered him, saying “My Lord and my God!”"
43,20,29,"Jesus said to him,"
43,20,30,"Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples that are not recorded in this book."
43,20,31,"But these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that through believing you may have life in his name."
43,21,1,"Later on, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way."
43,21,2,"Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two of his other disciples were together."
43,21,3,"Simon Peter said to them, “I'm going fishing.”They told him, “We'll go with you, too.” So they went out and got into the boat but didn't catch a thing that night."
43,21,4,"Just as dawn was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore. The disciples didn't realize it was Jesus."
43,21,5,"Jesus said to them,"
43,21,6,"He told them,"
43,21,7,"That disciple whom Jesus kept loving said to Peter, “It's the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put back on his clothes, for he was practically naked, and jumped into the sea."
43,21,8,"But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish. They were only about a hundred yards away from the shore."
43,21,9,"When they arrived at the shore, they saw a charcoal fire with fish lying on it, and some bread."
43,21,10,"Jesus told them,"
43,21,11,"So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish—153 of them. And although there were so many of them, the net was not torn."
43,21,12,"Then Jesus said to them,"
43,21,13,"Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish."
43,21,14,"This was now the third time that Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he had been raised from the dead."
43,21,15,"When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,"
43,21,16,"Then he said to him a second time,"
43,21,17,"He said to him a third time,"
43,21,18,""
43,21,19,"Now he said this to show by what kind of death he would glorify God.After saying this, he told him,"
43,21,20,"Peter turned around and noticed the disciple whom Jesus kept loving following them. He was the one who had put his head on Jesus’ chest at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?”"
43,21,21,"When Peter saw him, he said, “Lord, what about him?”"
43,21,22,"Jesus said to him,"
43,21,23,"So the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple wasn't going to die. Yet Jesus didn't say to him that he wasn't going to die, but,"
43,21,24,"This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them down. We know that his testimony is true."
43,21,25,"Of course, Jesus also did many other things, and I suppose that if every one of them were written down the world couldn't contain the books that would be written."
44,1,1,"In my first book, Theophilus, I wrote about everything Jesus did and taught from the beginning,"
44,1,2,"up to the day when he was taken up to heaven after giving orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen."
44,1,3,"After he had suffered, he had shown himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them through a period of forty days and telling them about the kingdom of God."
44,1,4,"While he was meeting with them, he ordered them,"
44,1,5,""
44,1,6,"Now those who had come together began to ask him, “Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?”"
44,1,7,"He answered them,"
44,1,8,""
44,1,9,"After saying this, he was taken up while they were watching, and a cloud took him out of their sight."
44,1,10,"While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, two men in white robes were standing right beside them."
44,1,11,"They asked, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This same Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you saw him go up into heaven.”"
44,1,12,"Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away."
44,1,13,"When they came into the city, they went to the upstairs room where they had been staying. They were Peter and John; James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas the son of James."
44,1,14,"With one mind all of them kept devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers."
44,1,15,"At that time Peter got up among the brothers (there were about 120 people present) and said,"
44,1,16,"“Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the voice of David about Judas, who was the guide to those who arrested Jesus."
44,1,17,"For he was one of our number and was chosen to share in this ministry.”"
44,1,18,"(Now this man bought a field with the money he got for his crime. Falling on his face, he burst open in the middle, and all his intestines gushed out."
44,1,19,"This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that this field is called in their language Hakeldama, that is, “The Field of Blood”.)"
44,1,20,"“For in the Book of Psalms it is written,	‘Let his estate be desolate, and let no one live on it,’and	‘Let someone else take over his office.’"
44,1,21,"Therefore, one of the men who has associated with us all the time the Lord Jesus came and went among us,"
44,1,22,"beginning with the baptism of John until the day he was taken up from us, must become a witness with us to his resurrection.”"
44,1,23,"So they nominated two men—Joseph called Barsabbas, who also was called Justus, and Matthias."
44,1,24,"Then they prayed, “Lord, you know the hearts of all people. Show us which one of these two men you have chosen"
44,1,25,"to serve in this office of apostle, from which Judas fell away to go to his own place.”"
44,1,26,"So they drew lots for them, and when the lot fell on Matthias, he was added to the eleven apostles."
44,2,1,"When the day of Pentecost came, all of them were together in one place."
44,2,2,"Suddenly, a sound like the roaring of a mighty windstorm came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting."
44,2,3,"They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated, and one rested on each of them."
44,2,4,"All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them that ability."
44,2,5,"Now devout Jews from every nation under heaven were living in Jerusalem."
44,2,6,"When that sound came, the crowd rushed together and was startled because each one heard the disciples speaking in his own language."
44,2,7,"Stunned and amazed, they asked, “All of these people who are speaking are Galileans, aren't they?"
44,2,8,"So how is it that each one of us hears them speaking in his own native language?"
44,2,9,"We are Parthians, Medes, Elamites, people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,"
44,2,10,"Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the district of Libya near Cyrene, and visitors from Rome."
44,2,11,"We are Jews, proselytes, Cretans, and Arabs. Yet we hear them telling in our own tongues the great deeds of God!”"
44,2,12,"All of them continued to be stunned and puzzled, and they kept asking one another, “What can this mean?”"
44,2,13,"But others kept saying in derision, “They're full of sweet wine!”"
44,2,14,"Then Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and addressed them, “Men of Judea and everyone living in Jerusalem! You must understand something, so pay close attention to my words."
44,2,15,"These men are not drunk as you suppose, for it's only nine o'clock in the morning."
44,2,16,"Rather, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:"
44,2,17,"‘In the last days, God says,I will pour out my Spirit on everyone.	Your sons and your daughters will prophesy,your young men will see visions,and your old men will dream dreams."
44,2,18,"In those days I will even pour out my Spiriton my slaves, men and women alike,and they will prophesy."
44,2,19,"I will work wonders in the sky aboveand signs on the earth below:blood, fire, and clouds of smoke."
44,2,20,"The sun will turn to darkness,and the moon to blood,before the coming of the great and glorious Day of the Lord."
44,2,21,"Then whoever calls on the name of the Lordwill be saved.’"
44,2,22,"“Fellow Israelites, listen to these words! Jesus from Nazareth was a man accredited to you by God through miracles, wonders, and signs that God performed through him among you, as you yourselves know."
44,2,23,"This very man, after he was arrested according to the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men."
44,2,24,"But God raised him up and destroyed the pains of death, since it was impossible for him to be held in its power."
44,2,25,"For David says about him,	‘I always see the Lord in front of me,for he is at my right handso that I cannot be shaken."
44,2,26,"That is why my heart is gladand my tongue rejoices,yes, even my body still rests securely in hope."
44,2,27,"For you will not abandon my soul to Hadesor allow your Holy One to experience decay."
44,2,28,"You have made the ways of life known to me,and you will fill me with gladness in your presence.’"
44,2,29,"“Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and that his tomb is among us to this day."
44,2,30,"Therefore, since he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him with an oath to put one of his descendants on his throne,"
44,2,31,"he looked ahead and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ:	‘He was not abandoned to Hades,and his flesh did not experience decay.’"
44,2,32,"It was this very Jesus whom God raised, and of that we are all witnesses."
44,2,33,"He has been exalted to the right hand of God, has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, and has poured out what you are seeing and hearing."
44,2,34,"For David did not go up to heaven, but he said,	‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,"
44,2,35,"until I make your enemies your footstool.”’"
44,2,36,"Therefore, let the entire house of Israel understand beyond a doubt that God made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ!”"
44,2,37,"When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart. They asked Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?”"
44,2,38,"Peter answered them, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the Holy Spirit as a gift."
44,2,39,"For this promise belongs to you and your children, as well as to all those who are far away, whom the Lord our God may call to himself.”"
44,2,40,"With many more words he continued to testify and to plead with them, saying, “Be saved from this corrupt generation!”"
44,2,41,"So those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about 3,000 persons were added to them."
44,2,42,"They continually devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to times of prayer."
44,2,43,"A sense of fear came over everyone, and many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles."
44,2,44,"All the believers were together, and they shared everything with one another."
44,2,45,"They made it their practice to sell their possessions and goods and to distribute the proceeds to anyone who was in need."
44,2,46,"They had a single purpose and went to the temple every day. They ate at each other's homes and shared their food with glad and humble hearts."
44,2,47,"They kept praising God and enjoying the good will of all the people. And every day the Lord was adding to them people who were being saved."
44,3,1,"Peter and John were going up to the temple for the hour of prayer at three in the afternoon."
44,3,2,"Now a man who had been crippled from birth was being carried in. Every day people would lay him at what was called the Beautiful Gate so that he could beg from those who were going into the temple."
44,3,3,"When he saw that Peter and John were about to go into the temple, he asked them to give him something."
44,3,4,"Peter, along with John, looked him straight in the eye and said, “Look at us!”"
44,3,5,"So the man watched them closely, expecting to get something from them."
44,3,6,"However, Peter said, “I don't have any silver or gold, but I'll give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, walk!”"
44,3,7,"Then Peter took hold of his right hand and began to help him up. Immediately his feet and ankles became strong,"
44,3,8,"and he sprung to his feet, stood up, and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple, walking, jumping, and praising God."
44,3,9,"When all the people saw him walking and praising God,"
44,3,10,"they knew that he was the man who used to sit and beg at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him."
44,3,11,"While he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people came running together to them in what was called Solomon's Colonnade. They were dumbfounded."
44,3,12,"When Peter saw this, he said to the people: “Fellow Israelites, why are you wondering about this, and why are you staring at us as if by our own power or godliness we made him walk?"
44,3,13,"The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—the God of our ancestors—has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and rejected in the presence of Pilate, even though he had decided to let him go."
44,3,14,"You rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you,"
44,3,15,"and you killed the source of life, whom God raised from the dead. We are witnesses to that."
44,3,16,"It is his name, that is, by the faith of his name, that has healed this man whom you see and know. Yes, the faith that comes through him has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you."
44,3,17,"“And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance like your leaders."
44,3,18,"This is how God fulfilled what he had predicted through the voice of all the prophets—that his Christ would suffer."
44,3,19,"Therefore, repent and turn to him to have your sins blotted out,"
44,3,20,"so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord and so that he may send you Jesus, the Christ whom he appointed long ago."
44,3,21,"Heaven must receive him until the time of universal restoration that God announced long ago through the voice of his holy prophets."
44,3,22,"In fact, Moses said,‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to everything he tells you."
44,3,23,"Any person who will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.’"
44,3,24,"“Indeed, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who followed him, also predicted these days."
44,3,25,"You are the descendants of the prophets and the heirs of the covenant that God made with your ancestors when he said to Abraham, ‘Through your descendant all the families of the earth will be blessed.’"
44,3,26,"When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning every one of you from your evil ways.”"
44,4,1,"While they were speaking to the people, the priests, the commander of the temple guards, and the Sadducees came to them."
44,4,2,"They were greatly disturbed that Peter and John were teaching the people and declaring that in the case of Jesus there had been a resurrection from the dead."
44,4,3,"So they arrested them and placed them in custody until the next day, since it was already evening."
44,4,4,"But many of those who heard their message believed, and the number of men grew to about 5,000."
44,4,5,"The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes met in Jerusalem"
44,4,6,"with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and the rest of the high priest's family."
44,4,7,"They made them stand in front of them and began asking, “By what power or by what name did you do this?”"
44,4,8,"Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers and elders of the people!"
44,4,9,"If we are being questioned today for a good deed to someone who was sick or to learn how this man was healed,"
44,4,10,"you and all the people of Israel must understand that this man stands healthy before you because of the name of Jesus from Nazareth, whom you crucified but God raised from the dead."
44,4,11,"He is	‘the stone that was rejected by you builders,which has become the cornerstone.’"
44,4,12,"There is no salvation by anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven given among people by which we must be saved.”"
44,4,13,"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and found out that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and realized that they had been with Jesus."
44,4,14,"And seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could not say anything against them."
44,4,15,"So they ordered them to leave the Council and began to discuss the matter among themselves."
44,4,16,"They said, “What should we do with these men? For it's obvious to everybody living in Jerusalem that an unmistakable sign has been done by them, and we can't deny it."
44,4,17,"But to keep it from spreading any further among the people, let us warn them never again to speak to anyone in this name.”"
44,4,18,"So they called them in and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus."
44,4,19,"But Peter and John answered them, “You must decide whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than God,"
44,4,20,"for we cannot stop talking about what we have seen and heard.”"
44,4,21,"So they threatened them even more and then let them go. They couldn't find any way to punish them, because all the people continued to praise God for what had happened."
44,4,22,"For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old."
44,4,23,"After they were released, they went to their own people and told them everything the high priests and the elders had said."
44,4,24,"When they heard this, they all raised their voices to God and said, “Master, you made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them."
44,4,25,"You said by the Holy Spirit through the voice of our ancestor, your servant David,	‘Why do the Gentiles rage,and the people devise useless plots?"
44,4,26,"The kings of the earth take their stand,and rulers meet together against the Lordand against his Christ.’"
44,4,27,"“For in this city both Herod and Pontius Pilate actually met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,"
44,4,28,"to do all that your hand and your will had predetermined to take place."
44,4,29,"Lord, pay attention to their threats now, and allow your servants to speak your word with all boldness"
44,4,30,"as you stretch out your hand to heal and to perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”"
44,4,31,"When they had prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken, and all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness."
44,4,32,"Now the whole group of believers was one in heart and soul, and nobody called any of his possessions his own. Instead, they shared everything they owned."
44,4,33,"With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was on them all."
44,4,34,"For none of them needed anything, because all who had land or houses would sell them and bring the money received for the things sold"
44,4,35,"and lay it at the apostles’ feet. Then it was distributed to anyone who needed it."
44,4,36,"Now Joseph, a Levite and a native of Cyprus, who was named Barnabas by the apostles (the name means “a son of encouragement”),"
44,4,37,"sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet."
44,5,1,"But a man named Ananias, with the consent of his wife Sapphira, sold some property."
44,5,2,"With his wife's full knowledge he kept back some of the money for himself and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles’ feet."
44,5,3,"Peter asked, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart so that you should lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back some of the money you got for the land?"
44,5,4,"As long as it remained unsold, wasn't it your own? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? So how could you have conceived such a thing in your heart? You did not lie to men but to God!”"
44,5,5,"When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear seized everyone who heard about it."
44,5,6,"The young men got up, wrapped him up, carried him outside, and buried him."
44,5,7,"After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened."
44,5,8,"So Peter asked her, “Tell me, did you sell the land for that price?”She answered, “Yes, that was the price.”"
44,5,9,"Then Peter said to her, “How could you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you outside as well.”"
44,5,10,"She instantly fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in, they found her dead. So they carried her out and buried her next to her husband."
44,5,11,"And great fear seized the whole church and everyone else who heard about this."
44,5,12,"Now many signs and wonders were continuously being performed by the apostles among the people. And they were all together in Solomon's Colonnade."
44,5,13,"None of the other people dared to join them, although the people continued to hold them in high regard."
44,5,14,"Nevertheless, still more believers, a vast number of both men and women, were being added to the Lord."
44,5,15,"As a result, people kept carrying their sick into the streets and placing them on stretchers and cots so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he went by."
44,5,16,"Even from the towns around Jerusalem crowds continued coming in to bring their sick and those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and all of them were healed."
44,5,17,"Then the high priest and all those from the sect of the Sadducees who were with him were filled with jealousy. So they went out,"
44,5,18,"arrested the apostles, and put them in the city jail."
44,5,19,"But at night the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and led them out. He told them,"
44,5,20,"“Go and stand in the temple and keep on telling the people the whole message about this life.”"
44,5,21,"After they heard this, they went into the temple at daybreak and began to teach. The high priest and those who were with him arrived, called the Council and all the elders of Israel together, and sent word to the prison to have the men brought in."
44,5,22,"When the temple police got there, they did not find them in the prison. They came back and reported,"
44,5,23,"“We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”"
44,5,24,"When the commander of the temple guards and the high priests heard these words, they were utterly at a loss as to what could have happened to them."
44,5,25,"Then someone came and told them, “Look! The men you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!”"
44,5,26,"So the commander of the temple guards went with his men to bring them back without force, because they were afraid of being stoned to death by the people."
44,5,27,"When they brought them back, they made them stand before the Council, and the high priest began to question them."
44,5,28,"He said, “We gave you strict orders not to teach in his name, didn't we? Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to bring this man's blood on us!”"
44,5,29,"But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men."
44,5,30,"The God of our ancestors raised Jesus to life after you hung him on a tree and killed him."
44,5,31,"God has exalted to his right hand this very man as our Leader and Savior in order to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel."
44,5,32,"We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who keep on obeying him.”"
44,5,33,"When they heard this, they became furious and wanted to kill them."
44,5,34,"But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was respected by all the people, stood up in the Council and ordered the men to be taken outside for a little while."
44,5,35,"Then he said to them, “Fellow Israelites, consider carefully what you propose to do to these men."
44,5,36,"For in days gone by Theudas appeared, claiming that he was important, and about 400 men joined him. He was killed, and all his followers were dispersed and disappeared."
44,5,37,"After that man, at the time of the census, Judas the Galilean appeared and got people to follow him. He, too, died, and all his followers were scattered."
44,5,38,"“I'm telling you to keep away from these men for now. Leave them alone, because if this plan or movement is of human origin, it will fail."
44,5,39,"However, if it is from God, you won't be able to stop them, and you may even discover that you are fighting against God!” So they were convinced by him."
44,5,40,"After calling in the apostles and beating them, they ordered them to stop speaking in the name of Jesus and let them go."
44,5,41,"They left the Council, rejoicing to have been considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the Name."
44,5,42,"Every day in the temple and from house to house they kept teaching and proclaiming that Jesus is the Christ."
44,6,1,"In those days, as the number of the disciples was growing larger and larger, a complaint was made by the Hellenistic Jews against the Hebraic Jews that their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food."
44,6,2,"So the twelve called the whole group of disciples together and said, “It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to wait on tables."
44,6,3,"Therefore, brothers, appoint seven men among you who have a good reputation, who are full of the Spirit and wisdom, and we will put them in charge of this work."
44,6,4,"Then we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”"
44,6,5,"This suggestion pleased the whole group. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a Gentile convert to Judaism from Antioch."
44,6,6,"They had these men stand before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them."
44,6,7,"So the word of God continued to spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem continued to grow rapidly. Even a large number of priests became obedient to the faith."
44,6,8,"Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people."
44,6,9,"But some men who belonged to the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), as well as some Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and men from Cilicia and Asia, stood up and began to debate with Stephen."
44,6,10,"But they couldn't resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he kept speaking."
44,6,11,"So they secretly got some men to say, “We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.”"
44,6,12,"They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes. Then they rushed at him, grabbed him, and brought him before the Council."
44,6,13,"They had false witnesses stand up and say, “This man never stops saying things against this Holy Place and against the law."
44,6,14,"For we have heard him say that this Jesus from Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”"
44,6,15,"Then all who were seated in the Council glared at him and saw that his face was like the face of an angel."
44,7,1,"Then the high priest asked, “Is this true?”"
44,7,2,"Stephen replied, “Listen, brothers and fathers! The glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia before he settled in Haran."
44,7,3,"He said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives and go to the land I will show you.’"
44,7,4,"So he left the country of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. Then after the death of his father, God had him move to this country where you now live."
44,7,5,"He gave him no property in it, not even a foot of land, yet he promised to give it to him and his descendants after him as a permanent possession, even though he had no child."
44,7,6,"This is what God promised: His descendants would be strangers in a foreign country, and its people would enslave them and oppress them for 400 years."
44,7,7,"‘But I will punish the nation they serve,’ said God, ‘and afterwards they will leave and worship me in this place.’"
44,7,8,"Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, and he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. Then Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs."
44,7,9,"“The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him as a slave into Egypt. However, God was with him"
44,7,10,"and rescued him from all his troubles. He allowed him to win favor and show wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler of Egypt and of his whole household."
44,7,11,"“But a famine spread throughout Egypt and Canaan, and with it great suffering, and our ancestors couldn't find any food."
44,7,12,"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors on their first visit."
44,7,13,"On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh."
44,7,14,"Then Joseph sent word and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come to him—seventy-five persons in all."
44,7,15,"So Jacob went down to Egypt. Then he and our ancestors died."
44,7,16,"They were brought back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem."
44,7,17,"“Now as the time approached for the fulfillment of the promise that God had made to Abraham, the people multiplied and grew more numerous in Egypt,"
44,7,18,"until another king, who had not known Joseph, became ruler of Egypt."
44,7,19,"By shrewdly scheming against our people, he oppressed our ancestors and forced them to expose their infants so that they wouldn't live."
44,7,20,"“At this time Moses was born. He was beautiful in the sight of God, and for three months he was cared for in his father's house."
44,7,21,"When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son."
44,7,22,"So Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and became a great man in speech and action."
44,7,23,"“When he was forty years old, his heart was moved to visit his brothers, the descendants of Israel."
44,7,24,"Because he saw one of them being mistreated, he defended and avenged the man who was being mistreated by striking down the Egyptian."
44,7,25,"He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was using him to rescue them, but they didn't understand."
44,7,26,"The next day he showed himself to some of them while they were fighting and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers. Why should you harm each other?’"
44,7,27,"But the man who was harming his neighbor pushed Moses away and said, ‘Who made you ruler and judge over us?"
44,7,28,"You don't want to kill me like you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?’"
44,7,29,"At this statement Moses fled and lived as a foreigner in the land of Midian. There he had two sons."
44,7,30,"“When forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai."
44,7,31,"When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and when he approached to look at it, the voice of the Lord said,"
44,7,32,"‘I am the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses became terrified and didn't dare to look."
44,7,33,"Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take your shoes off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."
44,7,34,"I have surely seen the oppression of my people in Egypt and have heard their groans, and I have come down to rescue them. Now come, I will send you to Egypt.’"
44,7,35,"“This same Moses, whom they rejected by saying ‘Who made you ruler and judge?’, was the man whom God sent to be both their ruler and deliverer with the help of the angel who had appeared to him in the bush."
44,7,36,"It was he who led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years."
44,7,37,"It was this Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up a prophet for you from among your own brothers, just as he did me.’"
44,7,38,"This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with our ancestors. He received living truths to give to us,"
44,7,39,"but our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt."
44,7,40,"They said to Aaron, ‘Make gods for us who will lead us. This Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt—we don't know what happened to him!’"
44,7,41,"In those days they even made a calf, offered a sacrifice to their idol, and delighted in the works of their hands."
44,7,42,"“So God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the heavenly bodies. As it is written in the book of the Prophets:	‘O house of Israel,you didn't offer me slaughtered animals andsacrifices those forty years in the wilderness, did you?"
44,7,43,"You even took along the tent of Moloch,the star of your god Rephan,	and the images you made in order to worship them.So I will remove you beyond Babylon.’"
44,7,44,"“Our ancestors had the Tent of Testimony in the wilderness constructed, just as the one who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern he had seen."
44,7,45,"Our ancestors brought it here with Joshua when they replaced the nations that God drove out before our ancestors, and it was here until the time of David."
44,7,46,"He found favor with God and asked to design a dwelling for the house of Jacob,"
44,7,47,"but it was Solomon who built a house for him."
44,7,48,"However, the Most High does not live in buildings made by human hands. As the prophet says,"
44,7,49,"“‘Heaven is my throne,and the earth is my footstool.	What kind of house can you build for me,’ declares the Lord, “or what place is there in which I can rest?"
44,7,50,"It was my hand that made all these things, wasn't it?’”"
44,7,51,"“You stubborn people with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are always opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do."
44,7,52,"Which of the prophets did your ancestors fail to persecute? They killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One, and now you have become his betrayers and murderers."
44,7,53,"You received the law as ordained by angels, and yet you didn't obey it!”"
44,7,54,"While they were listening to these things, they became more and more furious and began to grind their teeth at him."
44,7,55,"But Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God."
44,7,56,"He said, “Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”"
44,7,57,"But they raised a loud shout, held their ears shut, and together they all rushed at him."
44,7,58,"They threw him out of the city and began to stone him to death. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul."
44,7,59,"As they continued to stone Stephen, he kept praying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!”"
44,7,60,"Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, don't hold this sin against them!” When he had said this, he died."
44,8,1,"Now Saul heartily approved of putting him to death. That day a severe persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all of them, except for the apostles, were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria."
44,8,2,"Devout men buried Stephen as they mourned loudly for him."
44,8,3,"But Saul kept trying to destroy the church. Going into one house after another, he began dragging off men and women and throwing them in prison."
44,8,4,"Now those who were scattered went from place to place preaching the word."
44,8,5,"Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began to preach the Christ to the people."
44,8,6,"The crowds, hearing his message and seeing the signs that he was doing, paid close attention to what was said by Philip."
44,8,7,"Unclean spirits screamed with a loud voice as they came out of the many people they had possessed, and many paralyzed and lame people were healed."
44,8,8,"As a result, there was great rejoicing in that city."
44,8,9,"Now in that city there was a man named Simon. He was practicing occult arts and thrilling the people of Samaria, claiming to be a great man."
44,8,10,"Everyone from the least to the greatest paid close attention to him, saying, “This man is the power of God, which is called great!”"
44,8,11,"They paid careful attention to him because he had thrilled them for a long time with his occultic performances."
44,8,12,"But when Philip proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, men and women believed and were baptized."
44,8,13,"Even Simon believed, and after he was baptized he became devoted to Philip. He was amazed to see the signs and great miracles that were happening."
44,8,14,"Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them."
44,8,15,"They went down and prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit."
44,8,16,"Before this he had not come on any of them. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,8,17,"Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit."
44,8,18,"Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money"
44,8,19,"and said, “Give me this power too, so that when I lay my hands on someone he will receive the Holy Spirit.”"
44,8,20,"But Peter said to him, “May your money perish with you because you thought you could obtain God's free gift with money!"
44,8,21,"You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart isn't right before God."
44,8,22,"So repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, this thought of your heart may be forgiven you."
44,8,23,"For I see that you're turning into bitter poison and that you’re being chained by wickedness!”"
44,8,24,"Simon answered, “Both of you pray to the Lord for me that none of the things you have said will happen to me.”"
44,8,25,"After they had given their testimony and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, continuing to proclaim the good news in many Samaritan villages."
44,8,26,"Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south by the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert road.”"
44,8,27,"So he got up and went. Now an Ethiopian eunuch was there. He was a member of the court of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and was in charge of all her treasures. He had come to Jerusalem to worship"
44,8,28,"and was returning home. He was seated in his chariot, reading the prophet Isaiah."
44,8,29,"The Spirit said to Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay close to it.”"
44,8,30,"So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah out loud.He asked, “Do you understand what you're reading?”"
44,8,31,"He replied, “How can I unless someone guides me?” So he invited Philip to get in and sit with him."
44,8,32,"This was the passage of Scripture he was reading:	“Like a sheep he was led away to be slaughtered,and like a lamb is silent before its shearer,so he does not open his mouth."
44,8,33,"In his humiliation, justice was denied him.Who can describe his generation?For his life is taken away from the earth.”"
44,8,34,"The eunuch said to Philip, “I ask you, about whom is the prophet speaking—about himself or about someone else?”"
44,8,35,"Then Philip opened his mouth and, starting from this Scripture, told him the good news about Jesus."
44,8,36,"As they were going along the road, they came to some water. The eunuch said, “Look, there's some water. What keeps me from being baptized?”"
44,8,38,"So he ordered the chariot to stop, and Philip and the eunuch both went down into the water, and Philip baptized him."
44,8,39,"When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away. The eunuch went on his way rejoicing and did not see Philip again."
44,8,40,"But Philip found himself at Azotus. As he was passing through the region, he kept proclaiming the good news in all the towns until he came to Caesarea."
44,9,1,"Now Saul, still breathing threats of murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest"
44,9,2,"and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way he might bring them in chains to Jerusalem."
44,9,3,"As he traveled along and was approaching Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly flashed around him."
44,9,4,"He dropped to the ground and heard a voice saying to him,"
44,9,5,"He asked, “Who are you, Lord?”He said,"
44,9,6,""
44,9,7,"Meanwhile, the men who were traveling with him were standing speechless, for they heard the voice but didn't see anyone."
44,9,8,"When Saul got up off the ground, he couldn't see anything, even though his eyes were open. So they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus."
44,9,9,"For three days he couldn't see, and he didn't eat or drink anything."
44,9,10,"Now in Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision,"
44,9,11,"The Lord said to him,"
44,9,12,""
44,9,13,"But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard many people tell how much evil this man has done to your saints in Jerusalem."
44,9,14,"He is here with authority from the high priests to put in chains all who call on your name.”"
44,9,15,"But the Lord said to him,"
44,9,16,""
44,9,17,"So Ananias left and went to that house. He laid his hands on Saul and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were traveling, has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”"
44,9,18,"All at once something like scales fell from his eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,"
44,9,19,"and after taking some food he felt strong again. For several days he stayed with the disciples in Damascus."
44,9,20,"He immediately started to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, “This is the Son of God.”"
44,9,21,"All who heard him were astonished and said, “This is the man who harassed those who called on his name in Jerusalem, isn't it? Didn't he come here to bring them in chains to the high priests?”"
44,9,22,"But Saul grew more and more powerful and continued to confound the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that this man was the Christ."
44,9,23,"After several days had gone by, the Jews plotted to murder him,"
44,9,24,"but their plot became known to Saul. They were even watching the gates day and night to murder him,"
44,9,25,"but his disciples took him one night and let him down through the wall by lowering him in a basket."
44,9,26,"When he arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they all were afraid of him because they wouldn't believe he was a disciple."
44,9,27,"Barnabas, however, took him and presented him to the apostles, telling them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who had spoken to him, and how courageously he had spoken in the name of Jesus in Damascus."
44,9,28,"So he went in and out among them in Jerusalem, speaking courageously in the name of the Lord."
44,9,29,"He kept talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews, but they were bent on murdering him."
44,9,30,"When the brothers found out about it, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus."
44,9,31,"So the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria enjoyed peace. As it continued to be built up and to live in the fear of the Lord, it kept increasing in numbers through the encouragement of the Holy Spirit."
44,9,32,"Now when Peter was going around among all of the disciples, he also came down to the saints living in Lydda."
44,9,33,"There he found a man named Aeneas who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years."
44,9,34,"Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ is healing you. Get up and put away your bed!” At once he got up,"
44,9,35,"and all the people who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord."
44,9,36,"In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha, which in Greek is Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity, which she was always doing."
44,9,37,"At that time she got sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upstairs room."
44,9,38,"As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was there and sent two men to him and begged him, “Come to us without delay!”"
44,9,39,"So Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they took him upstairs. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him all the shirts and coats Dorcas made while she was still with them."
44,9,40,"But Peter made them all go outside. After he knelt down and prayed, he turned to the body and said, “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up."
44,9,41,"He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then he called the saints and widows and gave her back to them alive."
44,9,42,"This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord."
44,9,43,"Meanwhile, Peter stayed in Joppa for several days with Simon, a leatherworker."
44,10,1,"Now in Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment."
44,10,2,"He was a devout man who feared God, as did everyone in his home. He gave many gifts to the poor among the people and always prayed to God."
44,10,3,"One day about three in the afternoon he had a vision and clearly saw an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, “Cornelius!”"
44,10,4,"He stared at the angel in terror and asked, “What is it, Lord?”He answered him, “Your prayers and your gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial before God."
44,10,5,"Send men now to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter."
44,10,6,"He is a guest of Simon, a leatherworker, whose house is by the sea.”"
44,10,7,"When the angel who had spoken to him had gone, Cornelius summoned two of his household servants and a devout soldier, one of those who served him regularly."
44,10,8,"He explained everything to them and sent them to Joppa."
44,10,9,"Around noon the next day, while they were on their way and coming close to the town, Peter went up on the roof to pray."
44,10,10,"He became very hungry and wanted to eat, and while the food was being prepared, he fell into a trance"
44,10,11,"and saw heaven open and something like a large linen sheet coming down, being lowered by its four corners to the ground."
44,10,12,"In it were all kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles, and birds of the air."
44,10,13,"Then a voice told him,"
44,10,14,"But Peter said, “Absolutely not, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean!”"
44,10,15,"Again a voice came to him a second time,"
44,10,16,"This happened three times. Then the sheet was quickly taken into heaven."
44,10,17,"While Peter was still at a loss to know what the vision he had seen could mean, the men sent by Cornelius asked for Simon's house and went to the gate."
44,10,18,"They called out and asked if Simon who was called Peter was staying there."
44,10,19,"Peter was still thinking about the vision when the Spirit said to him, “Look! Three men are looking for you."
44,10,20,"Get up, go downstairs, and don't hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.”"
44,10,21,"So Peter went to the men and said, “I'm the man you're looking for. Why are you here?”"
44,10,22,"The men replied, “Cornelius, a centurion and an upright and God-fearing man who is respected by the whole Jewish nation, was instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his home to hear what you have to say.”"
44,10,23,"So Peter invited them in, and they were his guests. The next day he got up and went with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along with him."
44,10,24,"The next day they arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called his relatives and close friends together."
44,10,25,"When Peter was about to go in, Cornelius met him, bowed down at his feet, and began to worship him."
44,10,26,"But Peter made him get up, saying, “Stand up! I, too, am only a man.”"
44,10,27,"As Peter talked with him, he went in and found that many people had gathered."
44,10,28,"He said to them, “You understand how wrong it is for a Jew to associate or visit with a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should stop calling anyone common or unclean,"
44,10,29,"and that is why I didn't hesitate when I was sent for. Now may I ask why you sent for me?”"
44,10,30,"Cornelius replied, “Four days ago at this very hour, three o'clock in the afternoon, I was praying in my home. All at once a man in radiant clothes stood in front of me"
44,10,31,"and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your gifts to the poor have been remembered before God."
44,10,32,"So send messengers to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter, to come to you. He is a guest in the home of Simon, a leatherworker, by the sea.’"
44,10,33,"So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. All of us are here now in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has ordered you to say.”"
44,10,34,"Then Peter opened his mouth and said, “Now I understand that God shows no partiality."
44,10,35,"Indeed, the person who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him in any nation."
44,10,36,"He has sent his word to the descendants of Israel and brought them the good news of peace through Jesus Christ. This man is the Lord of everyone."
44,10,37,"You know what happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached."
44,10,38,"God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and he went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him."
44,10,39,"We are witnesses of everything he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They hung him on a tree and killed him,"
44,10,40,"but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear—"
44,10,41,"not to all the people, but to us who were chosen by God to be witnesses and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead."
44,10,42,"He also ordered us to preach to the people and to testify solemnly that this is the one ordained by God to be the judge of the living and the dead."
44,10,43,"To him all the prophets testify that everyone who believes in him receives the forgiveness of sins through his name.”"
44,10,44,"While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all the people who were listening to his message."
44,10,45,"Then the circumcised believers who had come with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles, too."
44,10,46,"For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God.Then Peter said,"
44,10,47,"“No one can stop us from using water to baptize these people who have received the Holy Spirit in the same way that we did, can he?”"
44,10,48,"So he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days."
44,11,1,"Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted the word of God."
44,11,2,"But when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who emphasized circumcision disagreed with him."
44,11,3,"They said, “You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them!”"
44,11,4,"Then Peter began to explain to them point by point what had happened. He said,"
44,11,5,"“I was in the town of Joppa praying when in a trance I saw a vision: Something like a large linen sheet was coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners, and it came right down to me."
44,11,6,"When I examined it closely, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the air."
44,11,7,"I also heard a voice telling me,"
44,11,8,"But I replied, ‘Absolutely not, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth!’"
44,11,9,"Then the voice from heaven answered a second time,"
44,11,10,"This happened three times. Then everything was pulled up to heaven again."
44,11,11,"“At that very moment three men arrived at the house where we were staying. They had been sent to me from Caesarea."
44,11,12,"The Spirit told me to go with them and not to treat them differently. These six brothers went with me, too, and we went into the man's house."
44,11,13,"Then he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his home and saying, ‘Send messengers to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter."
44,11,14,"He will speak words to you by which you and your entire home will be saved.’"
44,11,15,"“When I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as he had on us at the beginning."
44,11,16,"Then I remembered the word of the Lord—how he had said,"
44,11,17,"Now if God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to try to stop God?”"
44,11,18,"When they heard this, they quieted down, and praised God, saying, “So God has given even the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.”"
44,11,19,"Now the people who were scattered by the persecution that started because of Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews."
44,11,20,"But among them were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene who came to Antioch and began talking to the Hellenistic Jews too, proclaiming the Lord Jesus."
44,11,21,"The hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number of people believed and turned to the Lord."
44,11,22,"News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and so they sent Barnabas all the way to Antioch."
44,11,23,"When he arrived, he rejoiced to see what the grace of God had done, and with a hearty determination he continuously encouraged them all to remain faithful to the Lord."
44,11,24,"For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith. And so a large crowd was brought to the Lord."
44,11,25,"Then Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul."
44,11,26,"When he found him, he brought him to Antioch, and for a whole year they were guests of the church and taught a large crowd. It was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians."
44,11,27,"At that time some prophets from Jerusalem came down to Antioch."
44,11,28,"One of them named Agabus got up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine all over the world. This happened during the reign of Claudius."
44,11,29,"So every one of the disciples decided, as he was able, to send a contribution to the brothers living in Judea."
44,11,30,"They did this by sending Barnabas and Saul to the elders."
44,12,1,"About that time, Herod arrested some people who belonged to the church and mistreated them."
44,12,2,"He even had James the brother of John killed with a sword."
44,12,3,"When he saw how this was agreeable to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter, too. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread."
44,12,4,"When he arrested him, he put him in prison and turned him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, planning to bring him out to the people after the Passover."
44,12,5,"So Peter was being kept in prison, but earnest prayer to God for him was being offered by the church."
44,12,6,"That very night, before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter, bound with two chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, and guards in front of the door were watching the prisoners."
44,12,7,"Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on his side, woke him up, and said, “Get up quickly!” His chains fell from his wrists."
44,12,8,"Then the angel said to him, “Tuck in your shirt and put on your sandals!” He did this. Then the angel told him, “Put on your coat and follow me!”"
44,12,9,"So he went out and began to follow him, not realizing that what was being done by the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision."
44,12,10,"They passed the first guard, then the second, and came to the iron gate that led into the city. It opened by itself for them, and they went outside and proceeded one block when the angel suddenly left him."
44,12,11,"Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I'm sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hands of Herod and from everything the Jewish people were expecting!”"
44,12,12,"When he realized what had happened, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where a large number of people had gathered and were praying."
44,12,13,"When he knocked at the outer gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer it."
44,12,14,"On recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that she didn't open the gate but ran in and announced that Peter was standing at the gate."
44,12,15,"They said to her, “You're out of your mind!” But she kept insisting that it was so. Then they said, “It's his angel.”"
44,12,16,"Meanwhile, Peter kept on knocking and knocking. When they opened the gate, they saw him and were amazed."
44,12,17,"He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet, and then he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He added, “Tell this to James and the brothers.” Then he left and went somewhere else."
44,12,18,"When morning came, there was no little commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter."
44,12,19,"Herod searched for him but didn't find him, so he questioned the guards and ordered them to be executed. Then he left Judea, went down to Caesarea, and stayed there for a while."
44,12,20,"Now Herod had a violent quarrel with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came to him as a group. After they had won over Blastus, who took care of the king's bedroom, they asked for peace because their country depended on the king's country for food."
44,12,21,"Therefore, on a day that was set, Herod put on his royal robes, sat down on the royal seat, and made a speech to them."
44,12,22,"The people kept shouting, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man!”"
44,12,23,"Immediately the angel of the Lord struck him down because he did not give glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and died."
44,12,24,"But the word of God continued to grow and spread."
44,12,25,"When Barnabas and Saul had fulfilled their mission, they returned to Jerusalem, bringing with them John who was also called Mark."
44,13,1,"Now Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul were prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch."
44,13,2,"While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set Barnabas and Saul apart for me to do the work for which I called them.”"
44,13,3,"Then they fasted and prayed, laid their hands on them, and let them go."
44,13,4,"Being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went to Seleucia and from there sailed to Cyprus."
44,13,5,"Arriving in Salamis, they began to preach God's word in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John to help them."
44,13,6,"They went through the whole island as far as Paphos, where they found a Jewish occult practitioner and false prophet named Bar-Jesus."
44,13,7,"He was associated with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. He sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God."
44,13,8,"But Elymas the occult practitioner (that is the meaning of his name) continued to oppose them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith."
44,13,9,"But Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked him straight in the eye"
44,13,10,"and said, “You are full of every form of deception and trickery, you son of the devil, you enemy of all that is right! You will never stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord, will you?"
44,13,11,"The hand of the Lord is against you now, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a while!” At that moment a dark mist came over him, and he went around looking for someone to lead him by the hand."
44,13,12,"When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was astonished at the Lord's teaching."
44,13,13,"Then Paul and his men set sail from Paphos and arrived in Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and went back to Jerusalem."
44,13,14,"They left Perga and arrived in Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down."
44,13,15,"After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders asked them, “Brothers, if you have any message of encouragement for the people, you may speak.”"
44,13,16,"Then Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and said: “Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen!"
44,13,17,"The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made them a great people during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he led them out of it."
44,13,18,"After he had put up with them for forty years in the wilderness,"
44,13,19,"he destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan. Then he gave them their land as an inheritance"
44,13,20,"for about 450 years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel."
44,13,21,"“Then they demanded a king, and for forty years God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin."
44,13,22,"But he removed Saul and made David their king, about whom he testified, ‘I have found that David, the son of Jesse, is a man after my own heart, who will carry out all my wishes.’"
44,13,23,"It was from this man's descendants that God, as he promised, brought to Israel a Savior, who is Jesus."
44,13,24,"Before his coming, John had already preached a baptism of repentance to all the people in Israel."
44,13,25,"When John was finishing his work, he said, ‘Who do you think I am? I am not the one. No, but he is coming after me, and I am not worthy to untie the sandals on his feet.’"
44,13,26,"“My brothers, descendants of Abraham's family, and those among you who fear God, it is to us that the message of this salvation has been sent."
44,13,27,"For the people who live in Jerusalem and their leaders, not knowing who he was, condemned him and fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath."
44,13,28,"Although they found no reason to sentence him to death, they asked Pilate to have him executed."
44,13,29,"When they had finished doing everything that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and placed him in a tomb."
44,13,30,"But God raised him from the dead,"
44,13,31,"and for many days he appeared to those who had come with him to Jerusalem from Galilee. These are now his witnesses to the people."
44,13,32,"We are telling you the good news: What God promised our ancestors"
44,13,33,"he has fulfilled for us, their descendants, by raising Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm, ‘You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.’"
44,13,34,"He raised him from the dead, never to experience decay. As he said, ‘I will give you the holy promises made to David.’"
44,13,35,"In another Psalm he says, ‘You will not let your Holy One experience decay.’"
44,13,36,"For David, after he had served God's purpose in his own generation, died and was laid to rest with his ancestors, and so he experienced decay."
44,13,37,"However, the man whom God raised did not experience decay."
44,13,38,"“Therefore, brothers, you must understand that through him the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,"
44,13,39,"and that everyone who believes in him is justified and freed from everything that kept you from being justified by the law of Moses."
44,13,40,"So be careful that what the prophets said does not happen to you:"
44,13,41,"‘Look, you mockers!Be amazed and die!	For I am doing a work in your days, a work that you would not believeeven if someone told you!’”"
44,13,42,"As Paul and Barnabas were leaving, the people kept urging them to tell them the same things the next Sabbath."
44,13,43,"When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who kept talking to them and urging them to continue in the grace of God."
44,13,44,"The next Sabbath almost the whole town gathered to hear the word of the Lord."
44,13,45,"But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to object to the statements made by Paul and even to abuse him."
44,13,46,"Then Paul and Barnabas boldly declared, “We had to speak God's word to you first, but since you reject it and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we are now going to turn to the Gentiles."
44,13,47,"For that is what the Lord ordered us to do: ‘I have made you a light to the Gentiles to be the means of salvation to the very ends of the earth.’”"
44,13,48,"When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord. Meanwhile, all who had been destined to eternal life believed,"
44,13,49,"and the word of the Lord began to spread throughout the whole region."
44,13,50,"But the Jews stirred up devout women of high social standing and the officials in the city, started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their territory."
44,13,51,"So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium."
44,13,52,"Meanwhile, the disciples continued to be full of joy and of the Holy Spirit."
44,14,1,"In Iconium they went into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed."
44,14,2,"But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers."
44,14,3,"They stayed there a considerable time and continued to speak boldly for the Lord, who kept affirming his word of grace and granting signs and wonders to be done by them."
44,14,4,"But the people of the city were divided. Some were with the Jews, while others were with the apostles."
44,14,5,"Now when an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, along with their authorities, to mistreat and stone them,"
44,14,6,"they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian towns of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding territory."
44,14,7,"There they kept telling the good news."
44,14,8,"Now in Lystra there was a man sitting down who couldn't use his feet. He had been crippled from birth and had never walked."
44,14,9,"He was listening to Paul as he spoke. Paul watched him closely, and when he saw that he had faith to be healed,"
44,14,10,"he said in a loud voice, “Stand up straight on your feet!” Then the man jumped up and began to walk."
44,14,11,"When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have become like men and have come down to us!”"
44,14,12,"They began to call Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes, because he was the main speaker."
44,14,13,"The priest of the temple of Zeus, which was just outside the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates. He and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifices."
44,14,14,"But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,"
44,14,15,"“Men, why are you doing this? We are merely human beings with natures like your own. We are telling you the good news to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them."
44,14,16,"In past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways,"
44,14,17,"yet he has not left himself without a witness by doing good, by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, and by filling you with food and joyful hearts.”"
44,14,18,"Even by saying this it was all they could do to keep the crowds from offering sacrifices to them."
44,14,19,"But some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowds by persuasion. They stoned Paul and dragged him out of the town, thinking he was dead."
44,14,20,"But the disciples formed a circle around him, and he got up and went back to town. The next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe."
44,14,21,"As they were proclaiming the good news in that city, they discipled a large number of people. Then they went back to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,"
44,14,22,"strengthening the souls of the disciples and encouraging them to continue in the faith, saying, “We must endure many hardships to get into the kingdom of God.”"
44,14,23,"They appointed elders for them in each church, and with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had believed."
44,14,24,"Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia."
44,14,25,"They spoke the word in Perga and went down to Attalia."
44,14,26,"From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had completed."
44,14,27,"When they arrived, they called the church together and told them everything that God had done with them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles."
44,14,28,"Then they spent a long time with the disciples."
44,15,1,"Then some men came down from Judea and started to teach the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the law of Moses, you can't be saved.”"
44,15,2,"Paul and Barnabas had quite a dispute and argument with them. So Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to confer with the apostles and elders about this question."
44,15,3,"They were sent on their way by the church, and as they were going through Phoenecia and Samaria they told of the conversion of the Gentiles and brought great joy to all the brothers."
44,15,4,"When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders, and they reported everything that God had done through them."
44,15,5,"But some believers from the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “They must be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of Moses.”"
44,15,6,"So the apostles and the elders met to consider this statement."
44,15,7,"After a lengthy debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God chose me to be the one among you through whom the Gentiles would hear the message of the gospel and believe."
44,15,8,"God, who knows everyone's heart, showed them he approved by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us."
44,15,9,"He made no distinction between them and us, because he cleansed their hearts by faith."
44,15,10,"So why do you test God by putting on the disciples’ neck a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we could carry?"
44,15,11,"We certainly believe that it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that we are saved, just as they are.”"
44,15,12,"The whole crowd was silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul tell about all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles."
44,15,13,"After they had finished speaking, James responded by saying, “Brothers, listen to me."
44,15,14,"Simeon has explained how God first showed his concern for the Gentiles by taking from among them a people for his name."
44,15,15,"This agrees with the words of the prophets. As it is written,"
44,15,16,"‘After this, I will come backand set up David's fallen tent again.	I will restore its ruined places and set it up again"
44,15,17,"so that the rest of the people may search for the Lord,			including all the Gentiles who are called by my name,	declares the Lord.	He is the one who has been doing these things"
44,15,18,"that have always been known.’"
44,15,19,"Therefore, I have decided that we should not trouble these Gentiles who are turning to God."
44,15,20,"Instead, we should write to them to keep away from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from anything strangled, and from blood."
44,15,21,"After all, Moses has had people to proclaim him in every city for generations, and on every Sabbath he is read aloud in the synagogues.”"
44,15,22,"Then the apostles, the elders, and the whole church decided to choose some of their men to send with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch. These were Judas, who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, who were leaders among the brothers."
44,15,23,"They wrote this letter for them to deliver:“From the apostles and the elders, your brothers, to their Gentile brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. Greetings."
44,15,24,"We have heard that some men, coming from us without instructions from us, have said things to trouble you and have unsettled your minds."
44,15,25,"So we have unanimously decided to choose men and send them to you with our dear Barnabas and Paul,"
44,15,26,"who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,15,27,"We have therefore sent Judas and Silas to tell you the same things by word of mouth."
44,15,28,"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to place on you any burden but these essential requirements:"
44,15,29,"to keep away from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from anything strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you avoid these things, you will prosper. Goodbye.”"
44,15,30,"So the men were sent on their way and arrived in Antioch. They gathered the congregation together and delivered the letter."
44,15,31,"When the people read it, they were pleased with the encouragement it brought them."
44,15,32,"Then Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers."
44,15,33,"After staying there for some time, they were sent back with a greeting from the brothers to those who had sent them."
44,15,35,"Both Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch and taught and proclaimed the word of the Lord, as did many others."
44,15,36,"Some days after this, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let's go back and visit the brothers in every town where we proclaimed the word of the Lord and see how they're doing.”"
44,15,37,"Barnabas persisted in wanting to take along John, who was called Mark,"
44,15,38,"but Paul did not think it was right to be taking along the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them into the work."
44,15,39,"The disagreement was so sharp that they parted ways. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus,"
44,15,40,"while Paul chose Silas and left after the brothers had commended him to the grace of the Lord."
44,15,41,"He went through Syria and Cilicia and strengthened the churches."
44,16,1,"He also went to Derbe and Lystra. Here there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, although his father was a Greek."
44,16,2,"He was highly regarded by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium."
44,16,3,"Paul wanted this man to go with him, so he took him and had him circumcised because of the Jews who lived in those places, for everyone knew that his father was a Greek."
44,16,4,"As they went from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for them to obey."
44,16,5,"So the churches continued to be strengthened in the faith and to increase in numbers every day."
44,16,6,"Then they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia because they had been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia."
44,16,7,"They went as far as Mysia and tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not let them."
44,16,8,"So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas."
44,16,9,"During the night Paul had a vision. A man from Macedonia was standing there and pleading with him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!”"
44,16,10,"As soon as he had seen the vision, we immediately looked for a way to go to Macedonia, for we were convinced that God had called us to tell them the good news."
44,16,11,"Sailing from Troas, we went straight to Samothrace, the next day to Neapolis,"
44,16,12,"and from there to Philippi, a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We were in this city for several days."
44,16,13,"On the Sabbath day we went out of the gate and along the river, where we thought there was a place of prayer. We sat down and began talking to the women who had gathered there."
44,16,14,"A woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple goods from the city of Thyatira, was listening to us. She was a worshiper of God, and the Lord opened her heart to listen carefully to what was being said by Paul."
44,16,15,"When she and her family were baptized, she urged us, “If you are convinced that I am a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my home.” And she continued to insist that we do so."
44,16,16,"Once, as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of fortune-telling and who had brought her owners a great deal of money by predicting the future."
44,16,17,"She would follow Paul and us and shout, “These men are servants of the Most High God and are proclaiming to you a way of salvation!”"
44,16,18,"She kept doing this for many days until Paul became annoyed, turned to the spirit, and said, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out that very moment."
44,16,19,"When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities in the public square."
44,16,20,"They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are stirring up a lot of trouble in our city. They are Jews"
44,16,21,"and are advocating customs that we are not allowed to accept or practice as Romans.”"
44,16,22,"The crowd joined in the attack against them. Then the magistrates had them stripped of their clothes and ordered them beaten with sticks."
44,16,23,"After giving them a severe beating, they threw them in jail and ordered the jailer to keep them under tight security."
44,16,24,"Having received these orders, he put them into the inner cell and fastened their feet in leg irons."
44,16,25,"Around midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them."
44,16,26,"Suddenly, there was an earthquake so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken. All the doors immediately flew open, and everyone's chains were unfastened."
44,16,27,"When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, for he thought the prisoners had escaped."
44,16,28,"But Paul shouted in a loud voice, “Don't hurt yourself, for we are all here!”"
44,16,29,"The jailer asked for torches and rushed inside. He was trembling as he knelt in front of Paul and Silas."
44,16,30,"Then he took them outside and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”"
44,16,31,"They answered, “Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you and your family will be saved.”"
44,16,32,"Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and everyone in his home."
44,16,33,"At that hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds. Then he and his entire family were baptized immediately."
44,16,34,"He brought them upstairs into his house and set food before them, and he and everyone in his house were thrilled to be believers in God."
44,16,35,"When day came, the magistrates sent guards and said, “Release those men.”"
44,16,36,"The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent word to release you. So come out now and go in peace.”"
44,16,37,"But Paul told them, “They have had us beaten publicly without a trial and have thrown us into jail, even though we are Roman citizens. Now are they going to throw us out secretly? Certainly not! Have them come and escort us out.”"
44,16,38,"The guards reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens."
44,16,39,"So they came, apologized to them, and escorted them out. Then they asked them to leave the city."
44,16,40,"Leaving the jail, they went to Lydia's house. They saw the brothers, encouraged them, and then left."
44,17,1,"They traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue."
44,17,2,"As usual, Paul went in and on three Sabbaths discussed the Scriptures with them."
44,17,3,"He explained and showed them that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. He said, “This very Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ.”"
44,17,4,"Some of them were persuaded to join Paul and Silas, especially a large crowd of devout Greeks and the wives of many prominent men."
44,17,5,"But the Jews became jealous, and they took some contemptible characters who used to hang out in the public square, formed a mob, and started a riot in the city. They attacked Jason's home and searched it for Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the people."
44,17,6,"When they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials and shouted, “These fellows who have turned the world upside down have come here, too,"
44,17,7,"and Jason has welcomed them as his guests. All of them oppose the emperor's decrees by saying that there is another king—Jesus!”"
44,17,8,"The crowd and the city officials were upset when they heard this,"
44,17,9,"but after they had gotten a bond from Jason and the others they let them go."
44,17,10,"That night the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue."
44,17,11,"These people were more receptive than those in Thessalonica. They were very willing to receive the message, and every day they carefully examined the Scriptures to see if those things were so."
44,17,12,"Many of them believed, including a large number of prominent Greek women and men."
44,17,13,"But when the Jews in Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul also in Berea, they went there to upset and incite the crowds."
44,17,14,"Then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed there."
44,17,15,"The men who escorted Paul took him all the way to Athens and, after receiving instructions to have Silas and Timothy join him as soon as possible, they left."
44,17,16,"While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred to its depths to see the city full of idols."
44,17,17,"So he began holding discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and other worshipers, as well as every day in the public square with anyone who happened to be there."
44,17,18,"Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also debated with him. Some asked, “What is this blabbermouth trying to say?” while others said, “He seems to be preaching about foreign gods.” This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection."
44,17,19,"Then they took him, brought him before the Areopagus, and asked, “May we know what this new teaching of yours is?"
44,17,20,"It sounds rather strange to our ears, and we would like to know what it means.”"
44,17,21,"Now all the Athenians and the foreigners living there used to spend their time in nothing else than repeating or listening to the latest ideas."
44,17,22,"So Paul stood up in front of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every way."
44,17,23,"For as I was walking around and looking closely at the objects you worship, I even found an altar with this written on it: ‘To an unknown god.’ So I am telling you about the unknown object you worship."
44,17,24,"The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth. He doesn't live in shrines made by human hands,"
44,17,25,"and he isn't served by hands as if he needed anything. He himself gives everyone life, breath, and everything."
44,17,26,"From one man he made every nation of humanity to live all over the earth, fixing the seasons of the year and the boundaries they live in,"
44,17,27,"so that they might look for God, somehow reach for him, and find him. Of course, he is never far from any one of us."
44,17,28,"For we live, move, and exist because of him, as some of your own poets have said: ‘For we are his children, too.’"
44,17,29,"So if we are God's children, we shouldn't think that the divine being is like gold, silver, or stone, or is an image carved by human imagination and skill."
44,17,30,"Though God has overlooked those times of ignorance, he now commands everyone everywhere to repent,"
44,17,31,"for he has set a day when he is going to judge the world with justice through a man he has appointed, and he has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”"
44,17,32,"When they heard about a resurrection of the dead, some began joking about it, while others said, “We will hear you again about this.”"
44,17,33,"And so Paul left the meeting."
44,17,34,"Some men joined him and became believers. With them were Dionysius, who was a member of the Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and some others along with them."
44,18,1,"After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth."
44,18,2,"There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to visit them,"
44,18,3,"and because they had the same trade he stayed with them. They worked together because they were tentmakers by trade."
44,18,4,"Every Sabbath he would argue in the synagogue and try to persuade both Jews and Greeks."
44,18,5,"But when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to the word as he solemnly assured the Jews that Jesus is the Christ."
44,18,6,"But when they began to oppose him and insult him, he shook out his clothes in protest and told them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”"
44,18,7,"Then he left that place and went to the home of a man named Titius Justus, who worshiped God and whose house was next door to the synagogue."
44,18,8,"Now Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, along with his whole family. Many Corinthians who heard Paul also believed and were baptized."
44,18,9,"One night the Lord said to Paul in a vision,"
44,18,10,""
44,18,11,"So he lived there for a year and a half and continued to teach the word of God among them."
44,18,12,"While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews united in an attack on Paul and brought him before the judge's seat."
44,18,13,"They said, “This man is persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to the law.”"
44,18,14,"Paul was about to open his mouth when Gallio said to the Jews, “If there were some misdemeanor or crime involved, it would be reasonable to put up with you Jews."
44,18,15,"But since it is a question about words, names, and your own law, you will have to take care of that yourselves. I refuse to be a judge in these matters.”"
44,18,16,"So he drove them away from the judge's seat."
44,18,17,"Then all of them took Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and began beating him in front of the judge's seat. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this."
44,18,18,"After staying there for quite a while longer, Paul said goodbye to the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchraea he had his hair cut, since he was under a vow."
44,18,19,"When they arrived in Ephesus, he left them there. Then he went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews."
44,18,20,"They asked him to stay longer, but he refused."
44,18,21,"As he told them goodbye, he said, “I will come back to you again if it is God's will.” Then he set sail from Ephesus."
44,18,22,"When he arrived in Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem, greeted the church, and then returned to Antioch."
44,18,23,"After spending some time there, he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples."
44,18,24,"Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos arrived in Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria and an eloquent man, one powerful in the Scriptures."
44,18,25,"He had been instructed in the Lord's way, and with spiritual fervor he kept speaking and teaching accurately about Jesus, although he knew only about John's baptism."
44,18,26,"He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained God's way to him more accurately."
44,18,27,"When he wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers wrote and urged the disciples to welcome him. On his arrival he greatly helped those who through grace had believed."
44,18,28,"He successfully refuted the Jews in public and proved by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ."
44,19,1,"It was while Apollos was in Corinth that Paul passed through the inland districts and came to Ephesus. He found a few disciples there"
44,19,2,"and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”They answered him, “No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”"
44,19,3,"He then asked, “Then into what were you baptized?”They answered, “Into John's baptism.”"
44,19,4,"Then Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.”"
44,19,5,"On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,19,6,"When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy."
44,19,7,"There were about twelve men in all."
44,19,8,"He went into the synagogue and spoke there boldly for three months, holding discussions and persuading them about the kingdom of God."
44,19,9,"But when some people became stubborn, refused to believe, and slandered the Way before the people, he left them, took his disciples away from them, and had daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus."
44,19,10,"This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the word of the Lord."
44,19,11,"God continued to do extraordinary miracles by Paul's hands."
44,19,12,"When the handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his skin were taken to the sick, their diseases left them, and the evil spirits went out of them."
44,19,13,"Then some Jews who went around trying to drive out demons attempted to use the name of the Lord Jesus on those who had evil spirits, saying, “I command you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches!”"
44,19,14,"Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this."
44,19,15,"But the evil spirit said to them, “I know Jesus, and I am acquainted with Paul, but who are you?”"
44,19,16,"Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them, got the better of them, and so violently overpowered all of them that they fled out of the house naked and bruised."
44,19,17,"When this became known to everyone living in Ephesus, Jews and Greeks alike, fear came on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus began to be held in high honor."
44,19,18,"Many who became believers kept coming and confessing and telling about their practices."
44,19,19,"Moreover, many people who had practiced occult arts gathered their books and burned them in front of everybody. They estimated the price of them and found they were worth 50,000 silver coins."
44,19,20,"In that way the word of the Lord kept spreading and triumphing."
44,19,21,"After these things had happened, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go through Macedonia and Achaia and then to go on to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have gone there, I must also see Rome.”"
44,19,22,"So he sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself stayed in Asia a while longer."
44,19,23,"Now just about that time a great commotion broke out concerning the Way."
44,19,24,"A silversmith named Demetrius provided a large income for the skilled workers by making silver shrines of Artemis."
44,19,25,"He called a meeting of these men and others who were engaged in similar trades and said, “Men, you well know that we get a good income from this business."
44,19,26,"You also see and hear that, not only in Ephesus, but almost all over Asia, this man Paul has won over and taken away a large crowd by telling them that gods made by human hands are not gods at all."
44,19,27,"There is a danger not only that our business will lose its reputation but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be brought into contempt and that she will be robbed of her majesty that brought all Asia and the world to worship her.”"
44,19,28,"When they heard this, they became furious and began to shout, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”"
44,19,29,"The city was filled with confusion, and the people rushed into the theater together, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's fellow travelers from Macedonia."
44,19,30,"Paul wanted to go into the crowd, but the disciples wouldn't let him."
44,19,31,"Even some officials of the province of Asia who were his friends sent him a message urging him not to risk his life in the theater."
44,19,32,"Meanwhile, some were shouting one thing, some another. For the assembly was confused, and most of them didn't know why they were meeting."
44,19,33,"Some of the crowd concluded it was because of Alexander, since the Jews had pushed him to the front. So Alexander motioned for silence and tried to make a defense before the people."
44,19,34,"But when they found out that he was a Jew, they all started to shout in unison for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”"
44,19,35,"When the city recorder had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, who in the world doesn't know that this city of Ephesus is the keeper of the temple of the great Artemis and of the statue that fell down from heaven?"
44,19,36,"Since these things cannot be denied, you must be quiet and not do anything reckless."
44,19,37,"For you have brought these men here, although they neither rob temples nor blaspheme our goddess."
44,19,38,"So if Demetrius and his workers have a charge against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They should accuse one another there."
44,19,39,"But if you want anything else, it must be settled in the regular assembly."
44,19,40,"For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, and there is no good reason we can give to justify this commotion.”"
44,19,41,"After saying this, he dismissed the assembly."
44,20,1,"When the uproar was over, Paul sent for the disciples and encouraged them. Then he said goodbye to them and left to go to Macedonia."
44,20,2,"He went through those regions and encouraged the people with many words. Then he went to Greece"
44,20,3,"and stayed there for three months. When he was about to sail for Syria, a plot was made against him by the Jews, so he decided to go back through Macedonia."
44,20,4,"He was accompanied by Sopater (the son of Pyrrhus) from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia."
44,20,5,"These men went on ahead and were waiting for us in Troas."
44,20,6,"After the days of Unleavened Bread, we sailed from Philippi, and days later we joined them in Troas and stayed there for seven days."
44,20,7,"On the first day of the week, when we had met to break bread, Paul began to address the people. Since he intended to leave the next day, he went on speaking until midnight."
44,20,8,"Now there were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting."
44,20,9,"A young man named Eutychus, who was sitting in a window, began to sink off into a deep sleep as Paul kept speaking longer and longer. Overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead."
44,20,10,"But Paul went down, bent over him, took him into his arms, and said, “Stop being alarmed, for his life is in him.”"
44,20,11,"Then he went back upstairs, broke the bread, and ate. He talked with them for a long time, until dawn, and then left."
44,20,12,"Then they took the boy away alive and were greatly relieved."
44,20,13,"We went ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were intending to pick up Paul. He had arranged it this way, since he had planned to travel there on foot."
44,20,14,"When he met us in Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene."
44,20,15,"We sailed from there and on the following day arrived off Chios. The next day we crossed over to Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The day after that we came to Miletus."
44,20,16,"Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in Asia, as he was in a hurry to get to Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost, if that was possible."
44,20,17,"From Miletus he sent messengers to Ephesus to ask the elders of the church to meet with him."
44,20,18,"When they came to him, he said to them, “You know how I lived among you the entire time from the first day I set foot in Asia."
44,20,19,"I served the Lord with all humility, with tears, and with trials that came to me through the plots of the Jews."
44,20,20,"I never shrank from telling you anything that would help you nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house."
44,20,21,"I testified to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus."
44,20,22,"“And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,"
44,20,23,"except that in town after town the Holy Spirit assures me that imprisonment and suffering are waiting for me."
44,20,24,"But I don't place any value on my life, if only I can finish my race and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus of testifying to the gospel of God's grace."
44,20,25,"“Now I know that none of you among whom I traveled preaching the kingdom will ever see my face again."
44,20,26,"I therefore declare to you today that I am not responsible for the blood of any of you,"
44,20,27,"for I never shrank from telling you the whole plan of God."
44,20,28,"Pay attention to yourselves and to the entire flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to be shepherds of God's church, which he acquired with his own blood."
44,20,29,"I know that when I'm gone savage wolves will come among you and not spare the flock."
44,20,30,"Indeed, some of your own men will come forward and distort the truth in order to lure the disciples into following them."
44,20,31,"So be alert! Remember that for three years, night and day, I never stopped warning each of you with tears."
44,20,32,"“I am now entrusting you to God and to the message of his grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified."
44,20,33,"I never desired anyone's silver, gold, or clothes."
44,20,34,"You yourselves know that I worked with my own hands to support myself and those who were with me."
44,20,35,"In every way I showed you that by working hard like this we should help the weak and remember the words that the Lord Jesus himself said,"
44,20,36,"When he had said this, he knelt down and prayed with all of them."
44,20,37,"All of them cried and cried as they put their arms around Paul and kissed him with affection."
44,20,38,"They were especially sorrowful because of what he had said—that they would never see his face again. Then they took him to the ship."
44,21,1,"When we had torn ourselves away from them, we sailed straight to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara."
44,21,2,"There we found a ship going across to Phoenecia, so we went aboard and sailed away."
44,21,3,"We came in sight of Cyprus, and leaving it on our left we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre because the ship was to unload its cargo there."
44,21,4,"So we looked up the disciples and stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit they kept telling Paul not to go to Jerusalem,"
44,21,5,"but when our days there were ended we left and proceeded on our journey. All of them with their wives and children accompanied us out of the city. We knelt on the beach, prayed,"
44,21,6,"and said goodbye to each other. Then we went aboard the ship, and they went back home."
44,21,7,"On finishing the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, greeted the brothers, and stayed with them for one day."
44,21,8,"The next day we left and came to Caesarea. We went to the home of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him."
44,21,9,"He had four unmarried daughters who could prophesy."
44,21,10,"After we had been there for a number of days, a prophet named Agabus arrived from Judea."
44,21,11,"He came to us, took Paul's belt, and tied his own feet and hands with it. Then he said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘This is how the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man who owns this belt. Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles.’”"
44,21,12,"When we heard this, we and the people who lived there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,13,"Then Paul replied, “What do you mean by crying and breaking my heart? I'm ready not only to be tied up in Jerusalem but even to die for the name of the Lord Jesus!”"
44,21,14,"When he could not be persuaded, we remained silent except to say, “May the Lord's will be done.”"
44,21,15,"After those days, we got ready to go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,16,"Some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us. They took us to the home of Mnason to be his guests. He was from Cyprus and had been an early disciple."
44,21,17,"When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us warmly."
44,21,18,"The next day Paul went with us to visit James, and all the elders were present."
44,21,19,"After greeting them, Paul related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry."
44,21,20,"When they heard about it, they praised God and told him, “You see, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and all of them are zealous for the law."
44,21,21,"But they have been told about you—that you teach all the Jews living among the Gentiles to forsake the Law of Moses, and that you tell them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs."
44,21,22,"What is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come."
44,21,23,"So do what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow."
44,21,24,"Take these men, go through the purification ceremony with them, and pay the expenses to shave their heads. Then everyone will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself constantly observe and guard the law."
44,21,25,"As for the Gentiles who have become believers, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should keep away from food that has been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality.”"
44,21,26,"Then Paul took the men and the next day purified himself with them. Then he went into the temple to announce the time when the days of purification would be over and when the sacrifice would be offered for each of them."
44,21,27,"When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, seeing Paul in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd. They grabbed him,"
44,21,28,"yelling, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere to turn against our people, the law, and this place. More than that, he has even brought Greeks into the temple and desecrated this holy place.”"
44,21,29,"For they had earlier seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him and had supposed that Paul had taken him into the temple."
44,21,30,"The whole city was in chaos, and the people rushed together. They grabbed Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the doors were shut."
44,21,31,"They were trying to kill him when a report reached the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in an uproar."
44,21,32,"Immediately he took some soldiers and officers and ran down to them. When they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul."
44,21,33,"Then the tribune came up, grabbed Paul, and ordered him to be tied up with two chains. He then asked who Paul was and what he had done."
44,21,34,"Some of the crowd shouted this and some that. Since he couldn't learn the facts because of the confusion, he ordered him to be taken into the barracks."
44,21,35,"When Paul got to the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob."
44,21,36,"The crowd of people kept following him and shouting, “Kill him!”"
44,21,37,"Just as Paul was about to be taken into the barracks, he said to the tribune, “May I say something to you?”He asked, “Do you know Greek?"
44,21,38,"You're not the Egyptian who started a revolt some time ago and led 4,000 assassins into the desert, are you?”"
44,21,39,"Paul replied, “I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you to let me speak to the people.”"
44,21,40,"He gave him permission, and Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand for the people to be silent. When everyone had quieted down, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language."
44,22,1,"“Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense that I am now making before you.”"
44,22,2,"When they heard him speaking to them in Hebrew, they became even more quiet, and he continued,"
44,22,3,"“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia but raised in this city and educated at the feet of Gamaliel in the strict ways of our ancestral law. I am as zealous for God as all of you are today."
44,22,4,"I persecuted this Way even to the death and kept tying up both men and women and putting them in prison,"
44,22,5,"as the high priest and the whole Council of elders can testify about me. From them I also received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was going there to tie up those who were there and bring them back to Jerusalem to be punished."
44,22,6,"“But while I was on my way and approaching Damascus about noon, a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me."
44,22,7,"I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me,"
44,22,8,"I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ He said to me,"
44,22,9,"The men who were with me saw the light but didn't understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me."
44,22,10,"“Then I asked, ‘What am I to do, Lord?’ The Lord told me,"
44,22,11,"Since I could not see because of the brightness of the light, the men who were with me took me by the hand and led me into Damascus."
44,22,12,"“A certain Ananias, who was a devout man in accordance with the law and who was highly regarded by all the Jews living there,"
44,22,13,"came to me. He stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ At that moment I could see him."
44,22,14,"Then he said, ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear his own voice,"
44,22,15,"because you will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard."
44,22,16,"What are you waiting for now? Get up, be baptized, and have your sins washed away as you call on his name.’"
44,22,17,"“Then I returned to Jerusalem. While I was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance"
44,22,18,"and saw the Lord saying to me,"
44,22,19,"I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I kept imprisoning and beating those who believe in you."
44,22,20,"Even when the blood of your witness Stephen was being shed, I was standing there approving it and guarding the coats of those who were killing him.’"
44,22,21,"Then he said to me,"
44,22,22,"Up to this point they listened to him, but then they began to shout, “Away with such a fellow from the earth! He's not fit to go on living!”"
44,22,23,"While they were yelling, tossing their coats around, and throwing dirt into the air,"
44,22,24,"the tribune ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks and told the soldiers to question him with a beating in order to find out why they were yelling at him like this."
44,22,25,"But when they had tied him up with the straps, Paul asked the centurion who was standing there, “Is it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn't been condemned?”"
44,22,26,"When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, “What are you doing? This man is a Roman citizen!”"
44,22,27,"So the tribune went and asked Paul, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”“Yes,” he said."
44,22,28,"Then the tribune replied, “I paid a lot of money for this citizenship of mine.”Paul said, “But I was born a citizen.”"
44,22,29,"Immediately those who were about to examine him stepped back, and the tribune was afraid when he found out that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had tied him up."
44,22,30,"The next day, since the Tribune wanted to find out exactly what Paul was being accused of by the Jews, he released him and ordered the high priests and the entire Council to meet. Then he brought Paul down and had him stand before them."
44,23,1,"Paul looked straight at the Council and said, “Brothers, with a clear conscience I have done my duty before God up to this very day.”"
44,23,2,"Then the high priest Ananias ordered the men standing near him to strike him on the mouth."
44,23,3,"At this Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! How can you sit there and judge me according to the law and yet in violation of the law order me to be struck?”"
44,23,4,"The men standing near him asked, “Do you mean to insult God's high priest?”"
44,23,5,"Paul answered, “I didn't realize, brothers, that he is the high priest. After all, it is written, ‘You must not speak evil about a ruler of your people.’”"
44,23,6,"When Paul saw that some of them were Sadducees and others were Pharisees, he shouted in the Council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee and a descendant of Pharisees. I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead.”"
44,23,7,"After he said that, an angry quarrel broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided."
44,23,8,"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection and that there is no such thing as an angel or spirit, but the Pharisees believe in all those things."
44,23,9,"There was a great deal of shouting until some of the scribes who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and argued forcefully, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”"
44,23,10,"The quarrel was becoming violent, and the tribune was afraid that they would tear Paul to pieces. So he ordered the soldiers to go down, take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks."
44,23,11,"That night the Lord stood near him and said,"
44,23,12,"In the morning, the Jews formed a conspiracy and took an oath not to eat or drink anything before they had killed Paul."
44,23,13,"More than forty men formed this conspiracy."
44,23,14,"They went to the high priests and elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to taste any food before we have killed Paul."
44,23,15,"Now then, you and the Council must notify the tribune to bring him down to you on the pretext that you want to look into his case more carefully, but before he arrives we'll be ready to kill him.”"
44,23,16,"But the son of Paul's sister heard about the ambush, so he came and got into the barracks and told Paul."
44,23,17,"Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the tribune, because he has something to tell him.”"
44,23,18,"So he took him, brought him to the tribune, and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.”"
44,23,19,"The tribune took him by the hand, stepped aside to be alone with him, and asked, “What have you got to tell me?”"
44,23,20,"He answered, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Council tomorrow as though they were going to examine his case more carefully."
44,23,21,"Don't believe them, because more than forty of them are planning to ambush him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink before they have killed him. They are ready now, just waiting for your consent.”"
44,23,22,"The tribune dismissed the young man and ordered him not to tell anyone that he had notified him."
44,23,23,"Then he summoned two of the centurions and said, “Get 200 soldiers ready to leave for Caesarea at nine o'clock tonight, along with seventy mounted soldiers and 200 soldiers with spears."
44,23,24,"Provide an animal for Paul to ride, and take him safely to Governor Felix.”"
44,23,25,"He wrote a letter with this message:"
44,23,26,"“From Claudius Lysias to Your Excellency, Governor Felix. Greetings."
44,23,27,"This man had been seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I went with the guard and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen."
44,23,28,"I wanted to know the exact charge they were making against him, so I had him brought before their Council."
44,23,29,"I found that, although he was charged with questions about their law, there was no charge against him deserving death or imprisonment."
44,23,30,"Since a plot against the man has been reported to me, I am at once sending him to you and have also ordered his accusers to present their charges against him before you.”"
44,23,31,"So the soldiers, in keeping with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris."
44,23,32,"The next day they let the horsemen ride on with him while they returned to their barracks."
44,23,33,"When these came to Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him."
44,23,34,"After reading the letter, he asked which province he was from. On learning that he was from Cilicia,"
44,23,35,"he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers arrive.” Then he ordered him to be kept in custody in Herod's palace."
44,24,1,"Five days later, the high priest Ananias arrived with some elders and Tertullius, an attorney, and they presented their case against Paul before the governor."
44,24,2,"When Paul had been summoned, Tertullius opened the prosecution by saying:“Your Excellency Felix, since we are enjoying lasting peace through you, and since reforms for this nation are being brought about through your foresight,"
44,24,3,"we always and everywhere acknowledge it with profound gratitude."
44,24,4,"But so as not to detain you any further, I beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness."
44,24,5,"For we have found this man a perfect pest and an agitator among all Jews throughout the world. He is a ringleader in the sect of the Nazarenes"
44,24,6,"and even tried to profane the temple, but we arrested him."
44,24,8,"By examining him for yourself, you will be able to find out from him everything of which we accuse him.”"
44,24,9,"The Jews supported his accusations by asserting that these things were true."
44,24,10,"When the governor motioned for Paul to speak, he replied: “Since I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I am pleased to present my defense."
44,24,11,"You can verify for yourself that I went up to worship in Jerusalem no more than twelve days ago."
44,24,12,"They never found me debating with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or throughout the city,"
44,24,13,"and they cannot prove to you the charges they are now bringing against me."
44,24,14,"However, I admit to you that in accordance with the Way, which they call a heresy, I worship the God of our ancestors and believe in everything written in the Law and the Prophets."
44,24,15,"I have the same hope in God that they themselves cherish—that there is to be a resurrection of the righteous and the wicked."
44,24,16,"Therefore, I always do my best to have a clear conscience in the sight of God and people."
44,24,17,"After many years I have come back to my people to bring gifts for the poor and to offer sacrifices."
44,24,18,"They found me in the temple doing these things just as I had completed the purification ceremony. No crowd or noisy mob was present."
44,24,19,"But some Jews from Asia were there, and they should be here before you to accuse me if they have anything against me."
44,24,20,"Otherwise, these men themselves should tell what wrong they found when I stood before the Council—"
44,24,21,"unless it is for the one thing I shouted as I stood among them: ‘It is for the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”"
44,24,22,"Felix was rather well informed about the Way, and so he adjourned the trial with the comment, “When Tribune Lysias arrives, I will decide your case.”"
44,24,23,"He ordered the centurion to guard Paul but to let him have some freedom and not to keep any of his friends from caring for his needs."
44,24,24,"Some days later, Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him talk about faith in Christ Jesus."
44,24,25,"As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became afraid and said, “For the present you may go. When I get a chance, I will send for you again.”"
44,24,26,"At the same time he was hoping to get money from Paul, and so he would send for him frequently to talk with him."
44,24,27,"After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Since Felix wanted to do the Jews a favor, he left Paul in prison."
44,25,1,"Three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem."
44,25,2,"The high priests and Jewish leaders informed him of their charges against Paul, urging"
44,25,3,"and begging him as a favor to have Paul brought to Jerusalem. They were laying an ambush to kill him on the way."
44,25,4,"Festus replied that Paul was being kept in custody at Caesarea and that he himself would be going there soon."
44,25,5,"“Therefore,” he said, “have your authorities come down with me and present their charges against him, if there is anything wrong with the man.”"
44,25,6,"Festus stayed with them no more than eight or ten days and then went down to Caesarea. The next day he sat on the judge's seat and ordered Paul brought in."
44,25,7,"When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him and began bringing a number of serious charges against him that they couldn't prove."
44,25,8,"Paul said in his defense, “I have in no way sinned against the law of the Jews or the temple or the emperor.”"
44,25,9,"Then Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, asked Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be tried there before me on these charges?”"
44,25,10,"But Paul said, “I am standing before the emperor's judgment seat where I ought to be tried. I haven't done anything wrong to the Jews, as you know very well."
44,25,11,"If I am guilty and have done something that deserves death, I don't refuse to die. But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can hand me over to them as a favor. I appeal to the emperor!”"
44,25,12,"Festus talked it over with the council and then answered, “To the emperor you have appealed; to the emperor you will go!”"
44,25,13,"After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to welcome Festus."
44,25,14,"Since they were staying there for several days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king. He said, “There is a man here who was left in prison by Felix."
44,25,15,"When I went to Jerusalem, the high priests and the Jewish elders informed me about him and asked me to condemn him."
44,25,16,"I answered them that it was not the Roman custom to hand over a man for punishment until the accused met his accusers face to face and had an opportunity to defend himself against the charge."
44,25,17,"“So they came here with me, and the next day without any delay I sat down in the judge's seat and ordered the man to be brought in."
44,25,18,"When his accusers stood up, they didn't accuse him of any of the crimes I was expecting."
44,25,19,"Instead, they had several arguments with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who had died but whom Paul kept claiming was alive."
44,25,20,"I was puzzled how I should investigate such matters and asked if he would like to go to Jerusalem and be tried there in regard to these things."
44,25,21,"But Paul appealed his case and asked to be held in prison until the decision of his Majesty. So I ordered him to be held in custody until I could send him to the emperor.”"
44,25,22,"Agrippa told Festus, “I would like to hear the man.”“Tomorrow,” he said, “you will hear him.”"
44,25,23,"The next day Agrippa and Bernice arrived with much fanfare and went into the auditorium along with the tribunes and the leading men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in."
44,25,24,"Then Festus said, “King Agrippa and all you men who are present with us! You see this man about whom the whole Jewish nation petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer."
44,25,25,"I find that he has not done anything deserving of death. But since he has appealed to his Majesty, I have decided to send him."
44,25,26,"I have nothing reliable to write our Sovereign about him, so I have brought him to all of you, and especially to you, King Agrippa, so that I will have something to write after he is cross-examined."
44,25,27,"For it seems to me absurd to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.”"
44,26,1,"Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” So Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense."
44,26,2,"“I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, that I can defend myself today against all the accusations of the Jews,"
44,26,3,"since you are especially familiar with all the Jewish customs and controversies. I beg you, therefore, to listen patiently to me."
44,26,4,"All the Jews know how I lived from the earliest days of my youth with my own people and in Jerusalem."
44,26,5,"They have known for a long time, if they would but testify to it, that I lived as a Pharisee by the standard of the strictest sect of our religion."
44,26,6,"“And now it is for the hope of the promise made by God to our ancestors that I stand here on trial."
44,26,7,"Our twelve tribes, worshiping day and night with intense devotion, hope to attain it. It is for this hope, O King, that I am accused by the Jews."
44,26,8,"Why is it thought incredible by all of you that God should raise the dead?"
44,26,9,"Indeed, I myself thought it my duty to take extreme measures against the name of Jesus from Nazareth."
44,26,10,"That is what I did in Jerusalem. I received authority from the high priests and locked many of the saints in prison. And when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them."
44,26,11,"I would even punish them frequently in every synagogue and try to make them blaspheme. Raging furiously against them, I would hunt them down even to distant cities."
44,26,12,"“That is how I happened to be traveling to Damascus with authority based on a commission from the high priests."
44,26,13,"On the road at noon, O King, I saw from heaven a light that was brighter than the sun flash around me and those who were traveling with me."
44,26,14,"All of us fell to the ground, and I heard a voice asking me in the Hebrew language,"
44,26,15,"I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ The Lord answered,"
44,26,16,""
44,26,17,""
44,26,18,""
44,26,19,"“And so, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision."
44,26,20,"Instead, I first told the people in Damascus and Jerusalem, then the whole countryside of Judea, and then the Gentiles to repent, turn to God, and practice works that are consistent with such repentance."
44,26,21,"For this reason the Jews grabbed me in the temple and kept trying to kill me."
44,26,22,"I have had help from God to this day, and so I stand here to testify to high and low alike, stating only what the prophets and Moses said would happen—"
44,26,23,"that the Christ would suffer and be the first to rise from the dead and would announce light to our people and the Gentiles.”"
44,26,24,"As he continued to make his defense, Festus shouted, “You're out of your mind, Paul! Too much education is driving you crazy!”"
44,26,25,"But Paul said, “I'm not out of my mind, Your Excellency Festus. I'm uttering words of sober truth."
44,26,26,"Indeed, the king knows about these things, and I can speak to him freely. For I am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice, since this wasn't done in a corner."
44,26,27,"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you believe them!”"
44,26,28,"Agrippa said to Paul, “Can you so quickly persuade me to become a Christian?”"
44,26,29,"Paul replied, “Whether quickly or not, I wish to God that not only you but everyone listening to me today would become what I am—except for these chains!”"
44,26,30,"Then the king, the governor, Bernice, and those who were sitting with him got up."
44,26,31,"As they were leaving, they began to say to each other, “This man isn't doing anything to deserve death or imprisonment.”"
44,26,32,"Agrippa told Festus, “This man could have been set free if he hadn't appealed to the emperor.”"
44,27,1,"When it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they transferred Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the emperor's division."
44,27,2,"Boarding a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to the ports on the coast of Asia, we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us."
44,27,3,"The next day we arrived at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to visit his friends and receive any care he needed."
44,27,4,"After putting out from there, we sailed on the sheltered side of Cyprus because the winds were against us."
44,27,5,"We sailed along the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia and reached Myra in Lycia."
44,27,6,"There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on it."
44,27,7,"We sailed slowly for a number of days and with difficulty arrived off Cnidus. Then, because the wind was against us, we sailed on the sheltered side of Crete off Cape Salome."
44,27,8,"Sailing past it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea."
44,27,9,"Much time had been lost, and because navigation had become dangerous and the day of fasting had already past, Paul began to warn them"
44,27,10,"by saying, “Men, I see that in this voyage there will be hardship and a heavy loss not only of the cargo and ship but also of our lives.”"
44,27,11,"But the centurion was persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship and not by what Paul said."
44,27,12,"Since the harbor was not a good place to spend the winter, most of the men favored putting out to sea from there on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix and spend the winter there. It is a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest."
44,27,13,"When a gentle breeze began to blow from the south, they thought they could achieve their purpose. So they raised the anchor and began to sail close to the shore of Crete."
44,27,14,"But it was not long before a violent wind (called a northeaster) swept down from the island."
44,27,15,"The ship was caught so that it couldn't face the wind, and we gave up and were swept along."
44,27,16,"As we drifted to the sheltered side of a small island called Cauda, we barely managed to secure the ship's lifeboat."
44,27,17,"They pulled it up on deck and used ropes to brace the ship. Fearing that they would hit the large sandbank near Lybia, they lowered the sail and drifted along."
44,27,18,"The next day, because we were being tossed so violently by the storm, they began to throw the cargo overboard."
44,27,19,"On the third day they threw the ship's equipment overboard with their own hands."
44,27,20,"For a number of days neither the sun nor the stars were to be seen, and the storm continued to rage until at last all hope of our being saved vanished."
44,27,21,"After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not have sailed from Crete. You would have avoided this hardship and damage."
44,27,22,"But now I urge you to have courage because there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship."
44,27,23,"For just last night an angel of God, to whom I belong and whom I serve, stood by me"
44,27,24,"and said, ‘Stop being afraid, Paul! You must stand before the emperor. Indeed, God has given you all who are sailing with you.’"
44,27,25,"So have courage, men, for I trust God that it will turn out just as he told me."
44,27,26,"However, we will have to run aground on some island.”"
44,27,27,"It was the fourteenth night, and we were drifting through the Adriatic Sea when about midnight the sailors suspected that land was near."
44,27,28,"On taking soundings, they found a depth of twenty fathoms. A little later they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms."
44,27,29,"Fearing that we might run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and began praying for daylight to come."
44,27,30,"Now the sailors were trying to escape from the ship. They had lowered the lifeboat into the sea and pretended that they were going to lay out the anchors from the bow."
44,27,31,"Paul told the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.”"
44,27,32,"Then the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and set it adrift."
44,27,33,"Right up to daybreak Paul kept urging all of them to eat something, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have been waiting and going without food, having eaten nothing."
44,27,34,"So I urge you to eat something, for it will help you survive, since none of you will lose a hair from his head.”"
44,27,35,"After he said this, he took some bread, thanked God in front of everyone, broke it, and began to eat."
44,27,36,"All of them were encouraged and had something to eat."
44,27,37,"There were 276 of us on the ship."
44,27,38,"After they had eaten all they wanted, they began to lighten the ship by dumping the wheat into the sea."
44,27,39,"When day came, they couldn't recognize the land, but they could see a bay with a beach on which they planned to run the ship ashore if possible."
44,27,40,"So they cut the anchors free and left them in the sea. At the same time they untied the ropes that held the steering oars, raised the foresail to the wind, and headed for the beach."
44,27,41,"But they struck a sandbar and ran the ship aground. The bow stuck and couldn't be moved, while the stern was broken to pieces by the force of the waves."
44,27,42,"The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners to keep them from swimming ashore and escaping,"
44,27,43,"but the centurion wanted to save Paul and prevented them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land."
44,27,44,"The rest were to follow, some on planks and others on various pieces of the ship. In this way all of them got to shore safely."
44,28,1,"When we were safely on shore, we learned that the island was called Malta."
44,28,2,"The people who lived there were unusually kind to us. It had started to rain and was cold, and so they made a fire and welcomed all of us around it."
44,28,3,"Paul gathered a bundle of sticks and put it on the fire. A poisonous snake was forced out by the heat and attached itself to Paul's hand."
44,28,4,"When the people who lived there saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “This man must be a murderer! He may have escaped from the sea, but Justice won't let him live.”"
44,28,5,"But he shook the snake into the fire and wasn't harmed."
44,28,6,"They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god."
44,28,7,"The governor of the island, whose name was Publius, owned estates in that part of the island, and he welcomed us and entertained us with great hospitality for three days."
44,28,8,"The father of Publius happened to be sick in bed with fever and dysentery. Paul went to him, prayed, and healed him by placing his hands on him."
44,28,9,"After that had happened, the rest of the sick people on the island went to him and were healed."
44,28,10,"They honored us in many ways, and when we were going to sail, they supplied us with everything we needed."
44,28,11,"Three months later, we sailed on an Alexandrian ship that had spent the winter at the island. It had the Twin Brothers as its figurehead."
44,28,12,"We stopped at Syracuse and stayed there for three days."
44,28,13,"Then we weighed anchor and came to Rhegium. A day later a south wind began to blow, and on the second day we came to Puteoli."
44,28,14,"There we found some brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome."
44,28,15,"The brothers there heard about us and came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and felt encouraged."
44,28,16,"When we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier who was guarding him."
44,28,17,"Three days later, he called the leaders of the Jews together. When they assembled, he said to them, “Brothers, although I haven't done anything against our people or the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans."
44,28,18,"They examined me and wanted to let me go because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case."
44,28,19,"But the Jews objected and forced me to appeal to the emperor, even though I have no countercharge to bring against my own people."
44,28,20,"That's why I asked to see you and speak with you, since it is for the hope of Israel that I'm wearing this chain.”"
44,28,21,"They told him, “We haven't received any letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or mentioned anything bad about you."
44,28,22,"However, we would like to hear from you what you think, because everywhere people are talking against this sect.”"
44,28,23,"So they set a day to meet with him and came in large numbers to see him where he was staying. From morning until evening he continued to explain the kingdom of God to them, trying to convince them about Jesus from the law of Moses and the Prophets."
44,28,24,"Some of them were convinced by what he said, but others wouldn't believe."
44,28,25,"They disagreed with one another as they were leaving, and Paul added a statement: “How well did the Holy Spirit speak to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah!"
44,28,26,"He said,	‘Go to this people and say,“You will listen and listenbut never understand,and you will look and lookbut never see!"
44,28,27,"For this people's heart has become dull,and their ears are hard of hearing,	and they have shut their eyesso that they may never see with their eyes,	and listen with their ears,and understand with their heart	and turn and let me heal them.”’"
44,28,28,"“You must understand that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen.”"
44,28,30,"For two whole years he lived in his own rented place and welcomed everyone who came to him."
44,28,31,"He continued to preach the kingdom of God and to teach about the Lord Jesus Christ with perfect boldness and freedom."
45,1,1,"From Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God,"
45,1,2,"which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures"
45,1,3,"regarding his Son, who according to the flesh was a descendant of David,"
45,1,4,"and who according to the spirit of holiness was declared to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead—Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,1,5,"Through him we received grace and a commission as an apostle to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for the sake of his name."
45,1,6,"You, too, are among those who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ."
45,1,7,"To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be holy. May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!"
45,1,8,"First of all, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because the news about your faith is being reported throughout the world."
45,1,9,"For God, whom I serve in my spirit by preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you"
45,1,10,"in my prayers at all times, asking that somehow by God's will I may at last succeed in coming to you."
45,1,11,"For I am longing to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong,"
45,1,12,"that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine."
45,1,13,"I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now), so that I might reap a harvest among you, just as I have among the rest of the Gentiles."
45,1,14,"Both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish people, I am a debtor."
45,1,15,"That is why I am so eager to proclaim the gospel to you who live in Rome, too."
45,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is God's power for the salvation of everyone who believes, of the Jew first and of the Greek as well."
45,1,17,"For in it God's righteousness is being revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, “The righteous will live by faith.”"
45,1,18,"For God's wrath is being revealed from heaven against all the ungodliness and wickedness of those who in their wickedness suppress the truth."
45,1,19,"For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God himself has made it plain to them."
45,1,20,"For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes—his eternal power and divine nature—have been understood and observed by what he made, so that people are without excuse."
45,1,21,"For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him. Instead, their thoughts turned to worthless things, and their ignorant hearts were darkened."
45,1,22,"Though claiming to be wise, they became fools"
45,1,23,"and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images that looked like mortal human beings, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles."
45,1,24,"For this reason, God gave them over to impurity to follow the lusts of their hearts and to dishonor their bodies with one another."
45,1,25,"They exchanged God's truth for a lie and worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen."
45,1,26,"For this reason, God gave them over to degrading passions. Even their females exchanged their natural sexual function for one that is unnatural."
45,1,27,"In the same way, their males also abandoned the natural sexual function of females and burned with lust for one another. Males committed indecent acts with males, and received in themselves the appropriate penalty for their perversion."
45,1,28,"Furthermore, because they did not think it worthwhile to retain the full knowledge of God, God gave them over to degraded minds to perform acts that should not be done."
45,1,29,"They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, quarreling, deceit, and viciousness. They are gossips,"
45,1,30,"slanderers, God-haters, haughty, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to their parents,"
45,1,31,"foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless."
45,1,32,"Although they know God's just requirement—that those who practice such things deserve to die—they not only do these things but even applaud others who practice them."
45,2,1,"Therefore, you have no excuse—every one of you who judges. For when you pass judgment on another person, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, practice the very same things."
45,2,2,"Now we know that God's judgment against those who practice such is based on truth."
45,2,3,"So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on those who practice these things and then do them yourself, do you think you will escape God's judgment?"
45,2,4,"Or do you think so little of the riches of his kindness, forbearance, and patience, not realizing that it is God's kindness that is leading you to repentance?"
45,2,5,"But because of your stubborn and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God's righteous judgment will be revealed."
45,2,6,"For he will repay everyone according to what that person has done:"
45,2,7,"eternal life to those who strive for glory, honor, and immortality by patiently doing good;"
45,2,8,"but wrath and fury for those who in their selfish pride refuse to believe the truth and practice wickedness instead."
45,2,9,"There will be suffering and anguish for every human being who practices doing evil, for Jews first and for Greeks as well."
45,2,10,"But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who practices doing good, for Jews first and for Greeks as well."
45,2,11,"For God does not show partiality."
45,2,12,"For all who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law."
45,2,13,"For it is not merely those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight. No, it is those who do the law, who will be justified."
45,2,14,"For whenever Gentiles, who do not possess the law, do instinctively what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law."
45,2,15,"They show that what the law requires is written in their hearts, a fact to which their own consciences testify, and their thoughts will either accuse or excuse them"
45,2,16,"on that day when God, through Jesus Christ, will judge people's secrets according to my gospel."
45,2,17,"Now if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the law, and boast about God,"
45,2,18,"and know his will, and approve of what is best because you have been instructed in the law;"
45,2,19,"and if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness,"
45,2,20,"an instructor of ignorant people, and a teacher of infants because you have the full content of knowledge and truth in the law—"
45,2,21,"as you teach others, do you fail to teach yourself? As you preach against stealing, do you steal?"
45,2,22,"As you forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? As you abhor idols, do you rob temples?"
45,2,23,"As you boast about the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?"
45,2,24,"As it is written, “God's name is being blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”"
45,2,25,"For circumcision is valuable if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision."
45,2,26,"So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the law, his uncircumcision will be regarded as circumcision, won't it?"
45,2,27,"The man who is uncircumcised physically but who keeps the law will condemn you who break the law, even though you have the written law and circumcision."
45,2,28,"For a person is not a Jew because of his appearance, nor is circumcision something external and physical."
45,2,29,"No, a person is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by a written law. That person's praise will come from God, not from people."
45,3,1,"What advantage, then, does the Jew have, or what value is there in circumcision?"
45,3,2,"There are all kinds of advantages! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the utterances of God."
45,3,3,"What if some of them were unfaithful? Their unfaithfulness cannot cancel God's faithfulness, can it?"
45,3,4,"Of course not! God is true, even if everyone else is a liar. As it is written,	“You are right when you speak,and win your case when you go into court.”"
45,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness serves to confirm God's righteousness, what can we say? God is not unrighteous when he vents his wrath on us, is he? (I am talking in human terms.)"
45,3,6,"Of course not! Otherwise, how could God judge the world?"
45,3,7,"For if through my falsehood God's truthfulness increases to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?"
45,3,8,"Or can we say—as some people slander us by claiming that we say—“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is deserved!"
45,3,9,"What, then, does this mean? Are we Jews any better off? Not at all! For we have already accused everyone, both Jews and Greeks, of being under the power of sin."
45,3,10,"As it is written,	“Not even one person is righteous."
45,3,11,"No one understands.No one searches for God."
45,3,12,"All have turned away.Together they have become worthless.No one shows kindness, not even one person!"
45,3,13,"Their throats are open graves.With their tongues they practice deception.The venom of poisonous snakes is under their lips."
45,3,14,"Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness."
45,3,15,"Their feet are swift to shed blood."
45,3,16,"Ruin and misery mark their ways."
45,3,17,"They have not learned the path to peace."
45,3,18,"There is no fear of God before their eyes.”"
45,3,19,"Now we know that whatever the law says applies to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God."
45,3,20,"Therefore, no human being will be justified in God's sight by means of the works prescribed by the law, for through the law comes the full knowledge of sin."
45,3,21,"But now, apart from the law, God's righteousness is revealed and is attested by the Law and the Prophets—"
45,3,22,"God's righteousness through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction,"
45,3,23,"since all have sinned and continue to fall short of God's glory."
45,3,24,"By his grace they are justified freely through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,"
45,3,25,"whom God offered as a place where atonement by Christ's blood could occur through faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because he had waited patiently to deal with sins committed in the past."
45,3,26,"He wanted to demonstrate at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the person who has the faithfulness of Jesus."
45,3,27,"What, then, is there to boast about? That has been eliminated. On what principle? On that of works? No, but on the principle of faith."
45,3,28,"For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works prescribed by the law."
45,3,29,"Is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the Gentiles, too? Yes, of the Gentiles, too,"
45,3,30,"since there is only one God who will justify the circumcised on the basis of faith and the uncircumcised by that same faith."
45,3,31,"Do we, then, abolish the law by this faith? Of course not! Instead, we uphold the law."
45,4,1,"What, then, are we to say about Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh?"
45,4,2,"For if Abraham was justified by works, he would have had something to boast about—though not before God."
45,4,3,"For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”"
45,4,4,"Now to someone who works, wages are not considered a gift but an obligation."
45,4,5,"However, to someone who does not work, but simply believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness."
45,4,6,"Likewise, David also speaks of the blessedness of the person whom God regards as righteous apart from works:"
45,4,7,"“How blessed are those whose iniquities are forgivenand whose sins are covered!"
45,4,8,"How blessed is the person whose sinsthe Lord will never charge against him!”"
45,4,9,"Now does this blessedness come to the circumcised alone, or also to the uncircumcised? For we say, “Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness.”"
45,4,10,"Under what circumstances was it credited? Was he circumcised or uncircumcised? He had not been circumcised, but was uncircumcised."
45,4,11,"Afterward he received the mark of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. Therefore, he is the ancestor of all who believe while uncircumcised, in order that righteousness may be credited to them."
45,4,12,"He is also the ancestor of the circumcised—those who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised."
45,4,13,"For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law, but through the righteousness produced by faith."
45,4,14,"For if those who were given the law are the heirs, then faith is useless and the promise is worthless,"
45,4,15,"for the law brings about wrath. Now where there is no law, neither can there be any violation of it."
45,4,16,"Therefore, the promise is based on faith, so that it may be a matter of grace and may be guaranteed for all his descendants—not only for those who were given the law, but also for those who share Abraham's faith, who is the father of us all."
45,4,17,"As it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations.” Abraham acted in faith when he stood in God's presence, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence things that don't even exist."
45,4,18,"Hoping in spite of hopeless circumstances, he believed that he would become “the father of many nations,” just as he had been told: “This is how many descendants you will have.”"
45,4,19,"He did not weaken in faith when he thought about his own body (which was already as good as dead now that he was about a hundred years old) or about Sarah's inability to have children,"
45,4,20,"nor did he doubt God's promise out of a lack of faith. Instead, he became strong in faith and gave glory to God,"
45,4,21,"being absolutely convinced that God would do what he had promised."
45,4,22,"This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”"
45,4,23,"Now the words “it was credited to him” were written not only for him"
45,4,24,"but also for us. Our faith will be regarded in the same way, if we believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead."
45,4,25,"He was handed over to death because of our sins and was raised to life because of our justification."
45,5,1,"Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
45,5,2,"Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in our hope of sharing God's glory."
45,5,3,"Not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,"
45,5,4,"endurance produces character, and character produces hope."
45,5,5,"Now this hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us."
45,5,6,"For at just the right time, while we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly."
45,5,7,"For it is rare for anyone to die for a righteous person, though somebody might be brave enough to die for a good person."
45,5,8,"But God demonstrates his love for us by the fact that Christ died for us while we were still sinners."
45,5,9,"Now that we have been justified by his blood, how much more will we be saved from wrath through him!"
45,5,10,"For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life!"
45,5,11,"Not only that, but we also continue to boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received our reconciliation."
45,5,12,"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to everyone, because all have sinned."
45,5,13,"Certainly sin was in the world before the law was given, but no record of sin is kept when there is no law."
45,5,14,"Nevertheless, death ruled from the time of Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the same way Adam did when he disobeyed. He is a type of the one who would come."
45,5,15,"But God's free gift is not like Adam's offense. For if many people died as the result of one man's offense, how much more have God's grace and the free gift given through the kindness of one man, Jesus Christ, been showered on many people!"
45,5,16,"Nor can the free gift be compared to what came through the man who sinned. For the sentence that followed one man's offense brought condemnation, but the free gift brought justification, even after many offenses."
45,5,17,"For if, through one man, death ruled because of that man's offense, how much more will those who receive such overflowing grace and the gift of righteousness rule in life because of one man, Jesus Christ!"
45,5,18,"Consequently, just as one offense resulted in condemnation for everyone, so one act of righteousness results in justification and life for everyone."
45,5,19,"For just as through one man's disobedience many people were made sinners, so also through one man's obedience many people will be made righteous."
45,5,20,"Now the law crept in so that the offense would increase. But where sin increased, grace increased even more,"
45,5,21,"so that, just as sin ruled by bringing death, so also grace might rule by bringing justification that results in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,1,"What should we say, then? Should we go on sinning so that grace may increase?"
45,6,2,"Of course not! How can we who died as far as sin is concerned go on living in it?"
45,6,3,"Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into union with Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?"
45,6,4,"Therefore, through baptism we were buried with him into his death so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the Father's glory, we too may live an entirely new life."
45,6,5,"For if we have become united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his."
45,6,6,"We know that our old selves were crucified with him so that our sinful bodies might be rendered powerless and we might no longer be slaves to sin."
45,6,7,"For the person who has died has been freed from sin."
45,6,8,"Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him,"
45,6,9,"for we know that Christ, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him."
45,6,10,"For when he died, he died once and for all as far as sin is concerned. But now that he is alive, he lives for God."
45,6,11,"In the same way, you too must continually consider yourselves dead as far as sin is concerned, but alive to God in Christ Jesus."
45,6,12,"Therefore, do not let sin rule your mortal bodies so that you obey their desires."
45,6,13,"Stop offering the parts of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness. Instead, offer yourselves to God as people who have been brought from death to life and the parts of your body as instruments of righteousness to God."
45,6,14,"For sin will not have mastery over you, because you are not under law but under grace."
45,6,15,"What, then, does this mean? Should we go on sinning because we are not under law but under grace? Of course not!"
45,6,16,"Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?"
45,6,17,"But thank God that, though you were once slaves of sin, you became obedient from your hearts to that form of teaching with which you were entrusted!"
45,6,18,"And since you have been freed from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness."
45,6,19,"I am speaking in human terms because of the frailty of your flesh. Just as you once offered the parts of your body as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater disobedience, so now, in the same way, you must offer the parts of your body as slaves to righteousness that leads to sanctification."
45,6,20,"For when you were slaves of sin, you were free as far as righteousness was concerned."
45,6,21,"What benefit did you get from doing those things you are now ashamed of? For those things resulted in death."
45,6,22,"But now that you have been freed from sin and have become God's slaves, the benefit you reap is sanctification, and the result is eternal life."
45,6,23,"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in union with Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,7,1,"Don't you realize, brothers—for I am speaking to people who know the law—that the law can press its claims over a person only as long as he is alive?"
45,7,2,"For a married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he is living, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning her husband."
45,7,3,"So while her husband is living, she will be called an adulterer even if she lives with another man. But if her husband dies, she is free from this law, so that she is not an adulterer if she marries another man."
45,7,4,"In the same way, my brothers, through Christ's body you also died as far as the law is concerned, so that you may belong to another person, the one who was raised from the dead, and may bear fruit for God."
45,7,5,"For while we were living in the flesh, sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies to bear fruit for death."
45,7,6,"But now we have been released from the law by dying to what enslaved us, so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit, not under the old written code."
45,7,7,"What should we say, then? Is the law sinful? Of course not! In fact, I wouldn't have known sin if it had not been for the law. For I wouldn't have known what it means to covet if the law had not said, “You must not covet.”"
45,7,8,"But sin seized the opportunity provided by this commandment and produced in me all kinds of sinful desires. For apart from the law, sin is dead."
45,7,9,"At one time I was alive without any connection to the law. But when the commandment came, sin sprang to life,"
45,7,10,"and I died. I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death."
45,7,11,"For sin, seizing the opportunity provided by the commandment, deceived me and used it to kill me."
45,7,12,"So then, the law itself is holy, and the commandment is holy, just, and good."
45,7,13,"Now, did something good bring me death? Of course not! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used something good to cause my death, so that through the commandment sin might become more sinful than ever."
45,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am mere flesh, sold as a slave to sin."
45,7,15,"I don't understand what I am doing. For I don't do what I want to do, but instead do what I hate."
45,7,16,"Now if I do what I don't want to do, I agree that the law is good."
45,7,17,"As it is, I am no longer the one who is doing it, but it is the sin that lives in me."
45,7,18,"For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but I cannot carry it out."
45,7,19,"For I don't do the good I want to do, but instead do the evil that I don't want to do."
45,7,20,"But if I do what I don't want to do, I am no longer the one who is doing it, but it is the sin that lives in me."
45,7,21,"So I find this to be a law: when I want to do what is good, evil is right there with me."
45,7,22,"For I delight in the law of God in my inner being,"
45,7,23,"but I see in my body a different law waging war with the law in my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin that exists in my body."
45,7,24,"What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?"
45,7,25,"Thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself serve the law of God, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin."
45,8,1,"Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in union with Christ Jesus."
45,8,2,"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death."
45,8,3,"For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to deal with sin. He condemned sin in the flesh"
45,8,4,"so that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit."
45,8,5,"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit."
45,8,6,"To set our minds on the flesh leads to death, but to set our minds on the Spirit leads to life and peace."
45,8,7,"That is why the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile toward God. For it refuses to submit to the authority of God's law because it is powerless to do so."
45,8,8,"Indeed, those who are under the control of the flesh cannot please God."
45,8,9,"You, however, are not of the flesh but under the control of the Spirit, since God's Spirit lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him."
45,8,10,"But if Christ is in you, your bodies are dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness."
45,8,11,"And if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, then the one who raised Christ from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive by his Spirit who lives in you."
45,8,12,"Consequently, brothers, we have an obligation—but it is not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh."
45,8,13,"For if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die, but if by the Spirit you continually put to death the activities of the body, you will live."
45,8,14,"For all who are led by God's Spirit are God's children."
45,8,15,"For you have not received a spirit of slavery that leads you into fear again. Instead, you have received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba! Father!”"
45,8,16,"The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children."
45,8,17,"Now if we are children, we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if, in fact, we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory."
45,8,18,"For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed to us."
45,8,19,"For the creation is eagerly waiting for God to reveal his children,"
45,8,20,"because the creation was subjected to frustration, though not by its own choice. The one who subjected it did so in the hope"
45,8,21,"that the creation itself would also be set free from slavery to decay in order to share the glorious freedom of God's children."
45,8,22,"For we know that all creation has been groaning with the pains of childbirth right up to the present time."
45,8,23,"However, not only creation groans, but we who have the first fruits of the Spirit also groan inwardly as we eagerly wait for our adoption, the redemption of our bodies."
45,8,24,"For we were saved with this hope in mind. Now hope that is seen is not really hope, for who hopes for what can be seen?"
45,8,25,"But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience."
45,8,26,"In the same way, the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how to pray as we should. But the Spirit himself intercedes with groans too deep for words,"
45,8,27,"and the one who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, for the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to God's will."
45,8,28,"And we know that he works all things together for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose."
45,8,29,"For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers."
45,8,30,"And those whom he predestined, he also called; and those whom he called, he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified."
45,8,31,"What, then, can we say about all of this? If God is for us, who can be against us?"
45,8,32,"The one who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for all of us—surely he will give us all things along with him, won't he?"
45,8,33,"Who can bring an accusation against God's chosen people? It is God who justifies them!"
45,8,34,"Who can condemn them? Christ Jesus, who died—and more importantly, who has been raised and is seated at the right hand of God—is the one who is also interceding for us!"
45,8,35,"Who can separate us from Christ's love? Can trouble, distress, persecution, hunger, nakedness, danger, or a sword?"
45,8,36,"As it is written,	“For your sake we are being killed all day long.We are thought of as sheep to be slaughtered.”"
45,8,37,"No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through the one who loved us."
45,8,38,"For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,"
45,8,39,"nor anything above, nor anything below, nor anything else in all creation can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,9,1,"I am telling the truth in union with Christ—I am not lying, for my conscience, confirms it in the Holy Spirit."
45,9,2,"I have deep sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart,"
45,9,3,"for I could wish that I myself were condemned and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my relatives according to the flesh."
45,9,4,"They are Israelites. To them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises."
45,9,5,"To them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, Christ descended, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen."
45,9,6,"Now it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all Israelites truly belong to Israel,"
45,9,7,"and not all of Abraham's descendants are his true descendants. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that descendants will be named for you.”"
45,9,8,"That is, it is not the children of natural descent who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as descendants."
45,9,9,"For this is the language of promise: “At this time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”"
45,9,10,"Not only that, but Rebecca became pregnant by our ancestor Isaac."
45,9,11,"Yet before their children had been born or had done anything good or bad (so that God's plan of election might continue to operate"
45,9,12,"according to his calling and not by works), Rebecca was told, “The older child will serve the younger one.”"
45,9,13,"As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”"
45,9,14,"What can we say, then? God is not unrighteous, is he? Of course not!"
45,9,15,"For he says to Moses, “I will be merciful to the person I want to be merciful to, and I will be kind to the person I want to be kind to.”"
45,9,16,"Therefore, God's choice does not depend on a person's will or effort, but on God himself, who shows mercy."
45,9,17,"For the Scripture says to Pharaoh,	“I have raised you up for this very purpose,to demonstrate my power in you	and that my name might be proclaimedin all the earth.”"
45,9,18,"Therefore, God has mercy on whomever he chooses, and he hardens the heart of whomever he chooses."
45,9,19,"You may ask me, “Then why does God still find fault with anybody? For who can resist his will?”"
45,9,20,"On the contrary, who are you—mere man that you are—to talk back to God? Can an object that was molded say to the one who molded it, “Why did you make me like this?”"
45,9,21,"A potter has the right to do what he wants to with his clay, doesn't he? He can make something for a special occasion or something for ordinary use from the same lump."
45,9,22,"Now if God wants to demonstrate his wrath and reveal his power, can't he be extremely patient with the objects of his wrath that are made for destruction?"
45,9,23,"Can't he also reveal his glorious riches to the objects of his mercy that he has prepared ahead of time for glory—"
45,9,24,"including us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but from the Gentiles as well?"
45,9,25,"As he says in Hosea,	“Those who are not my peopleI will call my people,	and the one who was not lovedI will call my loved one."
45,9,26,"In the very place where it was said to them,‘You are not my people,’they will be called children of the living God.”"
45,9,27,"Isaiah also calls out concerning Israel,	“Although the descendants of Israelare as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore,only a few will be saved."
45,9,28,"For the Lord will carry out his planand shorten it in righteousness,because he will carry out his plan on the earth decisively.”"
45,9,29,"It is just as Isaiah predicted:	“If the Lord of the Heavenly Armieshad not left us some descendants,we would have become like Sodomand would have been compared to Gomorrah.”"
45,9,30,"What can we say, then? Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness, have attained righteousness, a righteousness that comes through faith."
45,9,31,"But Israel, who did pursue the righteousness that is based on the law, did not arrive at that law."
45,9,32,"Why not? Because they did not pursue it on the basis of faith, but as if it were based on works. They stumbled over the stone that causes people to stumble."
45,9,33,"As it is written,	“Look! I am placing a stone in Zionthat people will stumble over	and a large rock that will make them fall,and the one who believes in him will never be ashamed.”"
45,10,1,"Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God on behalf of the Jews is that they would be saved."
45,10,2,"For I can testify on their behalf that they have a zeal for God, but it is not in keeping with full knowledge."
45,10,3,"For they are ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God while they try to establish their own, and they have not submitted to God's righteousness."
45,10,4,"For Christ is the culmination of the law as far as righteousness is concerned for everyone who believes."
45,10,5,"For Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from the law as follows: “The person who obeys these things will find life in them.”"
45,10,6,"But the righteousness that comes from faith says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will go up to heaven?’ (that is, to bring Christ down),"
45,10,7,"or ‘Who will go down into the depths?’ (that is, to bring Christ back from the dead).”"
45,10,8,"But what does it say? “The message is near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart.” This is the message of faith that we proclaim:"
45,10,9,"If you declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
45,10,10,"For a person believes with his heart and is justified, and a person declares with his mouth and is saved."
45,10,11,"For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be ashamed.”"
45,10,12,"For there is no difference between Jew and Greek, because they all have the same Lord, who gives richly to all who call on him."
45,10,13,"For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”"
45,10,14,"How, then, can people call on someone they have not believed? And how can they believe in someone they have not heard about? And how can they hear without someone preaching?"
45,10,15,"And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written,	“How beautiful are the feet of thosewho bring the good news!”"
45,10,16,"But not everyone has obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah asks,	“Lord, who has believed our message?”"
45,10,17,"Consequently, faith comes from listening, and listening comes through the word of Christ."
45,10,18,"But I ask, “Didn't they hear?” Certainly they did! In fact,	“Their voice has gone out into the whole world,and their words to the ends of the earth.”"
45,10,19,"Again I ask, “Did Israel not understand?” Moses was the first to say,	“I will make you jealousby those who are not a nation;	I will make you angryby a nation that doesn't understand.”"
45,10,20,"And Isaiah boldly says,	“I was found by those who were not looking for me;I was revealed to those who were not asking for me.”"
45,10,21,"But about Israel he says,	“All day long I have held out my handsto a disobedient and rebellious people.”"
45,11,1,"So I ask, “God has not rejected his people, has he?” Of course not! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin."
45,11,2,"God has not rejected his people whom he chose long ago. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the story about Elijah, when he pleads with God against Israel?"
45,11,3,"“Lord, they have killed your prophets and demolished your altars. I am the only one left, and they are trying to take my life.”"
45,11,4,"But what was the divine reply to him? “I have reserved for myself 7,000 people who have not knelt to worship Baal.”"
45,11,5,"So it is at the present time: there is a remnant, chosen by grace."
45,11,6,"But if this is by grace, then it is no longer on the basis of works. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace."
45,11,7,"What, then, does this mean? It means that Israel failed to obtain what it was striving for, but those who were chosen obtained it. However, the rest were hardened."
45,11,8,"As it is written,	“To this day God has given them a spirit of deep sleep.Their eyes do not see, and their ears do not hear.”"
45,11,9,"And David says,	“Let their table become a snare and a trap,a stumbling block and a punishment for them."
45,11,10,"Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,and keep their backs forever bent.”"
45,11,11,"And so I ask, “They have not stumbled so as to fall, have they?” Of course not! On the contrary, because of their stumbling, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make the Jews jealous."
45,11,12,"Now if their stumbling means riches for the world, and if their fall means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!"
45,11,13,"I am speaking to you Gentiles. Because I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I am glorifying my ministry"
45,11,14,"in the hope that I can make my people jealous and save some of them."
45,11,15,"For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?"
45,11,16,"If the first part of the dough is holy, so is the whole batch. If the root is holy, so are the branches."
45,11,17,"Now if some of the branches have been broken off, and you, a wild olive branch, have been grafted in their place to share the rich root of the olive tree,"
45,11,18,"do not boast about being better than the other branches. If you boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you."
45,11,19,"Then you will say, “Branches were cut off so that I could be grafted in.”"
45,11,20,"That's right! They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you remain only because of faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid!"
45,11,21,"For if God did not spare the natural branches, he certainly will not spare you either."
45,11,22,"Consider, then, the kindness and severity of God: his severity toward those who fell, but God's kindness toward you—if you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you too will be cut off."
45,11,23,"If the Jews do not persist in their unbelief, they will be grafted in again, because God is able to graft them in."
45,11,24,"After all, if you were cut off from what is naturally a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much easier it will be for these natural branches to be grafted back into their own olive tree!"
45,11,25,"For I do not want you to be ignorant of this secret, brothers, so that you will not claim to be wiser than you are. A partial hardening has come on Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in."
45,11,26,"In this way, all Israel will be saved. As it is written,	“The Deliverer will come from Zion;he will remove ungodliness from Jacob."
45,11,27,"This is my covenant with themwhen I take away their sins.”"
45,11,28,"As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake, but as far as election is concerned, they are loved because of their ancestors."
45,11,29,"For God's gifts and calling never change."
45,11,30,"For just as you disobeyed God in the past but now have received his mercy because of their disobedience,"
45,11,31,"in order they too have disobeyed in the present so that they may receive mercy because of the mercy shown to you."
45,11,32,"For God has locked all people in the prison of their own disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all."
45,11,33,"O how deep are God's riches, wisdom, and knowledge! How impossible to explain his judgments or to understand his ways!"
45,11,34,"“Who has known the mind of the Lord?Or who has become his adviser?"
45,11,35,"Who has given him somethingonly to have him pay it back?”"
45,11,36,"For all things are from him, by him, and for him. Glory belongs to him forever! Amen."
45,12,1,"I therefore urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercies, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices that are holy and pleasing to God, for this is the reasonable way for you to worship."
45,12,2,"Do not be conformed to this world, but continually be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you may be able to determine what God's will is—what is proper, pleasing, and perfect."
45,12,3,"For by the grace given to me I ask every one of you not to think of yourself more highly than you should think, rather to think of yourself with sober judgment on the measure of faith that God has assigned each of you."
45,12,4,"For we have many parts in one body, but these parts do not all have the same function."
45,12,5,"In the same way, even though we are many people, we are one body in Christ and individual parts connected to each other."
45,12,6,"We have different gifts based on the grace that was given to us. So if your gift is prophecy, use your gift in proportion to your faith."
45,12,7,"If your gift is serving, devote yourself to serving others. If it is teaching, devote yourself to teaching others."
45,12,8,"If it is encouraging, devote yourself to encouraging others. If it is sharing, share generously. If it is leading, lead enthusiastically. If it is helping, help cheerfully."
45,12,9,"Your love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good."
45,12,10,"Be devoted to each other with mutual affection. Excel in showing respect for each other."
45,12,11,"Never be lazy in showing such devotion. Be on fire with the Spirit. Serve the Lord."
45,12,12,"Be joyful in hope, patient in trouble, and persistent in prayer."
45,12,13,"Supply the needs of the saints. Extend hospitality to strangers."
45,12,14,"Bless those who persecute you. Keep on blessing them, and never curse them."
45,12,15,"Rejoice with those who are rejoicing. Cry with those who are crying."
45,12,16,"Live in harmony with each other. Do not be arrogant, but associate with humble people. Do not think that you are wiser than you really are."
45,12,17,"Do not pay anyone back evil for evil, but focus your thoughts on what is right in the sight of all people."
45,12,18,"If possible, so far as it depends on you, live in peace with all people."
45,12,19,"Do not take revenge, dear fiends, but leave room for God's wrath. For it is written, “Vengeance belongs to me. I will pay them back, declares the Lord.”"
45,12,20,"But “if your enemy is hungry, feed him. For if he is thirsty, give him a drink. If you do this, you will pile burning coals on his head.”"
45,12,21,"Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good."
45,13,1,"Every person must be subject to the governing authorities, for no authority exists except by God's permission. The existing authorities have been established by God,"
45,13,2,"so that whoever resists the authorities opposes what God has established, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves."
45,13,3,"For the authorities are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you like to live without being afraid of the authorities? Then do what is right, and you will receive their approval."
45,13,4,"For they are God's servants working for your good. But if you do what is wrong, you should be afraid, for it is not without reason that they bear the sword. Indeed, they are God's servants to execute wrath on anyone who does wrong."
45,13,5,"Therefore, it is necessary for you to be subject, not only because of God's wrath but also because of your own conscience."
45,13,6,"This is also why you pay taxes. For rulers are God's servants faithfully devoting themselves to their work."
45,13,7,"Pay everyone whatever you owe them—taxes to whom taxes are due, tolls to whom tolls are due, fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due."
45,13,8,"Do not owe anyone anything—except to love one another. For the one who loves another has fulfilled the law."
45,13,9,"For the commandments, “You must not commit adultery; you must not murder; you must not steal; you must not covet,” and every other commandment are summed up in this statement: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”"
45,13,10,"Love never does anything that is harmful to its neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law."
45,13,11,"This is necessary because you know the times—that it's time for you to wake up from sleep. For our salvation is nearer now than when we became believers."
45,13,12,"The night is almost over, and the day is near. Let us therefore put aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light."
45,13,13,"Let us behave decently, as people who live in the light of day. No wild parties, drunkenness, sexual immorality, promiscuity, rivalry, or jealousy!"
45,13,14,"Instead, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not obey your flesh and its desires."
45,14,1,"Accept the person who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of arguing over differences of opinion."
45,14,2,"One person believes that he can eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables."
45,14,3,"The person who eats must not despise the person who does not eat, and the person who does not eat must not criticize the person who eats, for God has accepted him."
45,14,4,"Who are you to criticize someone else's servant? His own Lord will determine whether he stands or falls. And stand he will, because God is able to make him stand."
45,14,5,"One person decides that one day is better than another, while another person decides that all days are the same. Each one must be fully convinced in his own mind."
45,14,6,"The one who observes a special day, observes it to honor the Lord. The one who eats, eats to honor the Lord, since he gives thanks to God. And the one who does not eat, refrains from eating to honor the Lord; yet he, too, gives thanks to God."
45,14,7,"For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself."
45,14,8,"If we live, we live to honor the Lord; and if we die, we die to honor the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord."
45,14,9,"For this reason Christ died and returned to life, so that he might become the Lord of both the dead and the living."
45,14,10,"Why, then, do you criticize your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For all of us will stand before the judgment seat of God."
45,14,11,"For it is written,	“As certainly as I live, declares the Lord,every knee will bow to me,and every tongue will praise God.”"
45,14,12,"Consequently, each of us will give an account of himself to God."
45,14,13,"Therefore, let us no longer criticize each other. Instead, make up your mind not to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother."
45,14,14,"I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in and of itself. But it is unclean to a person who thinks it is unclean."
45,14,15,"For if your brother is being hurt by what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not destroy the person for whom Christ died by what you eat."
45,14,16,"Do not allow your good to be spoken of as evil."
45,14,17,"For God's kingdom does not consist of food and drink, but of righteousness, peace, and joy produced by the Holy Spirit."
45,14,18,"For the person who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by people."
45,14,19,"Therefore, let us keep on pursuing those things that bring peace and that lead to building one another up."
45,14,20,"Do not destroy God's work for the sake of food. Everything is clean, but it is wrong to make another person fall because of what you eat."
45,14,21,"The right thing to do is to avoid eating meat, drinking wine, or doing anything else that makes your brother stumble or become upset or weak."
45,14,22,"As for the faith you do have, have it as your own conviction before God. How blessed is the person who has no reason to condemn himself because of what he approves!"
45,14,23,"But the person who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not act in faith; and anything that is not done in faith is sin."
45,15,1,"Now we who are strong ought to be patient with the weaknesses of those who are not strong and must stop pleasing ourselves."
45,15,2,"Each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building him up."
45,15,3,"For even Christ did not please himself. Instead, as it is written, “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”"
45,15,4,"For everything that was written long ago was written for our instruction, so that we might have hope through the endurance and encouragement that the Scriptures give us."
45,15,5,"Now may God, the source of endurance and encouragement, allow you to live in harmony with each other as you follow Christ Jesus,"
45,15,6,"so that with one mind and one voice you might glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
45,15,7,"Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ accepted you, for the glory of God."
45,15,8,"For I tell you that Christ became a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God's truth in order to confirm the promises given to our forefathers,"
45,15,9,"so that the Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy. As it is written,	“That is why I will praise you among the Gentiles;I will sing praises to your name.”"
45,15,10,"Again he says,	“Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people!”"
45,15,11,"And again,	“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles!Let all the nations praise him.”"
45,15,12,"And again, Isaiah says,	“There will be a Root from Jesse.He will rise up to rule the Gentiles,and the Gentiles will hope in him.”"
45,15,13,"Now may God, the source of hope, fill you with all joy and peace as you believe, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit."
45,15,14,"I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are filled with goodness and full of all the knowledge you need to be able to instruct each other."
45,15,15,"However, on some points I have written to you rather boldly, both as a reminder to you and because of the grace given me by God"
45,15,16,"to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable because it has been sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
45,15,17,"Therefore, in Christ Jesus I have the right to boast about my work for God."
45,15,18,"For I am bold enough to tell you only about what Christ has accomplished through me in the bringing of Gentiles to obedience. By my words and actions,"
45,15,19,"by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of God's Spirit, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ from Jerusalem as far as Illyricum."
45,15,20,"My one ambition is to proclaim the gospel where the name of Christ is not known, lest I build on someone else's foundation."
45,15,21,"Rather, as it is written,	“Those who were never told about him will see,and those who have never heard will understand.”"
45,15,22,"This is why I have so often been hindered in coming to you."
45,15,23,"But now, having no further opportunities in these regions, I have the desire to come to you, as I have had for many years."
45,15,24,"Now that I am on my way to Spain, I hope to see you when I come your way and, after I have enjoyed your company for a while, to be sent on by you."
45,15,25,"Right now, however, I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints."
45,15,26,"For the believers in Macedonia and Achaia have been eager to share their resources with the poor among the saints in Jerusalem."
45,15,27,"Yes, they were eager to do this, and in fact they are obligated to help them, for if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings, they are obligated to be of service to them in material things."
45,15,28,"So when I have completed this task and have put my seal on this contribution of theirs, I will visit you on my way to Spain."
45,15,29,"And I know that when I come to you I will come with the full blessing of Christ."
45,15,30,"Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love that the Spirit produces, to join me in my struggle, earnestly praying to God for me"
45,15,31,"that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea, that my ministry to Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,"
45,15,32,"and that by the will of God I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed."
45,15,33,"Now may the God of peace be with all of you! Amen."
45,16,1,"Now I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant in the church at Cenchreae."
45,16,2,"Welcome her in the Lord as is appropriate for saints, and provide her with anything she may need from you, for she has assisted many people, including me."
45,16,3,"Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,"
45,16,4,"who risked their necks for my life. I am thankful to them, and so are all the churches among the Gentiles."
45,16,5,"Greet also the church in their house. Greet my dear friend Epaenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in Asia."
45,16,6,"Greet Mary, who has worked very hard for you."
45,16,7,"Greet Andronicus and Junias, my fellow Jews who are in prison with me and are prominent among the apostles. They were in Christ before I was."
45,16,8,"Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord."
45,16,9,"Greet Urbanus, our fellow in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys."
45,16,10,"Greet Apelles, who has been approved by Christ. Greet those who belong to the family of Aristobulus."
45,16,11,"Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew. Greet those in the family of Narcissus, who are in the Lord."
45,16,12,"Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who have worked hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, who has worked very hard in the Lord."
45,16,13,"Greet Rufus, the one chosen by the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too."
45,16,14,"Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them."
45,16,15,"Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the saints who are with them."
45,16,16,"Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you."
45,16,17,"Now I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who create divisions and sinful enticements in opposition to the teaching you have learned. Stay away from them!"
45,16,18,"For such people are not serving Christ our Lord but their own desires. By their smooth talk and flattering words they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting."
45,16,19,"For your obedience has become known to everyone, and I am full of joy for you. But I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil."
45,16,20,"The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you!"
45,16,21,"Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my fellow Jews."
45,16,22,"I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord."
45,16,23,"Gaius, who is host to me and the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus greet you."
45,16,25,"Now to the one who is able to strengthen you by my gospel and the message that I preach about Jesus Christ, by revealing the secret that was kept in silence in long ages past"
45,16,26,"but now has been made known through the prophets to all the Gentiles, in keeping with the decree of the eternal God to bring them to the obedience of faith—"
45,16,27,"to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory forever! Amen."
46,1,1,"From Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and from our brother Sosthenes,"
46,1,2,"to the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who continually call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours."
46,1,3,"May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!"
46,1,4,"I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God given you in Christ Jesus."
46,1,5,"For in him you have become rich in every way—in speech and knowledge of every kind."
46,1,6,"In this way, our testimony about Christ has been confirmed among you."
46,1,7,"Therefore, you don't lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed."
46,1,8,"He will keep you strong until the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
46,1,9,"Faithful is the God by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord."
46,1,10,"Brothers, I urge all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to be in agreement and not to have divisions among you, so that you may be perfectly united in your understanding and opinions."
46,1,11,"My brothers, some members of Chloe's family have made it clear to me that there are quarrels among you."
46,1,12,"This is what I mean: Each of you is saying, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,” or “I belong to Cephas,” or “I belong to Christ.”"
46,1,13,"Has Christ been divided? Paul wasn't crucified for you, was he? You weren't baptized in Paul's name, were you?"
46,1,14,"I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Chrispus and Gaius,"
46,1,15,"lest anyone can say that you were baptized in my name."
46,1,16,"(Yes, I also baptized the family of Stephanus. Beyond that, I'm not sure whether I baptized anyone else.)"
46,1,17,"For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, not with eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power."
46,1,18,"For the message about the cross is nonsense to those who are being destroyed, but it is God's power to us who are being saved."
46,1,19,"For it is written,	“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,and the intelligence of the intelligent I will reject.”"
46,1,20,"Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? God has turned the wisdom of the world into nonsense, hasn't he?"
46,1,21,"For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God, God decided through the nonsense of our preaching to save those who believe."
46,1,22,"Jews ask for signs, and Greeks look for wisdom,"
46,1,23,"but we preach Christ crucified. He is a stumbling block to Jews and nonsense to Gentiles,"
46,1,24,"but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is God's power and God's wisdom."
46,1,25,"For God's nonsense is wiser than human wisdom, and God's weakness is stronger than human strength."
46,1,26,"Brothers, think about your own calling. Not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth."
46,1,27,"But God chose what is nonsense in the world to make the wise feel ashamed. God chose what is weak in the world to make the strong feel ashamed."
46,1,28,"And God chose what is insignificant in the world, what is despised, what is nothing, in order to destroy what is something,"
46,1,29,"so that no human being may boast in God's presence."
46,1,30,"It is because of him that you are in union with Christ Jesus, who for us has become wisdom from God, as well as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption."
46,1,31,"Therefore, as it is written, “The person who boasts must boast in the Lord.”"
46,2,1,"When I came to you, brothers, I didn't come and tell you about God's secret with rhetorical language or wisdom."
46,2,2,"For while I was with you I resolved to know nothing except Jesus Christ and him crucified."
46,2,3,"It was in weakness, fear, and great trembling that I came to you."
46,2,4,"My message and my preaching were not accompanied by clever words of wisdom, but by a display of the Spirit's power,"
46,2,5,"so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on God's power."
46,2,6,"However, when we are among mature people, we do speak a message of wisdom, but not the wisdom of this world or of the rulers of this world, who are passing off the scene."
46,2,7,"Instead, we speak about God's secret wisdom that has been hidden, which God destined for our glory before the world began."
46,2,8,"None of the rulers of this world understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory."
46,2,9,"But as it is written,	“No eye has seen, no ear has heard,and no mind has imagined	the things that God has preparedfor those who love him.”"
46,2,10,"But God has revealed those things to us by his Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the deep things of God."
46,2,11,"Is there anyone who can understand his own thoughts except by his own inner spirit? In the same way, no one can know the thoughts of God except God's Spirit."
46,2,12,"Now, we have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we can understand the things that were freely given to us by God."
46,2,13,"We don't speak about these things in words taught us by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, as we explain spiritual things to spiritual people."
46,2,14,"A person who isn't spiritual doesn't accept the things of God's Spirit, for they are nonsense to him. He can't understand them because they are spiritually evaluated."
46,2,15,"The spiritual person evaluates everything but is subject to no one else's evaluation."
46,2,16,"For	“Who has known the mind of the Lordso that he can advise him?”However, we have the mind of Christ."
46,3,1,"Brothers, I couldn't talk to you as spiritual people but as worldly people, as mere infants in Christ."
46,3,2,"I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, because you weren't ready for it. Why, you're still not ready for it!"
46,3,3,"That's because you are still worldly. As long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you, you are worldly and living by human standards, aren't you?"
46,3,4,"For when one says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,” you are merely human, aren't you?"
46,3,5,"What is Apollos anyhow? Or what is Paul? Mere servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord gave to each of us his task."
46,3,6,"I did the planting, Apollos did the watering, but God kept everything growing."
46,3,7,"So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is significant, but God, who keeps everything growing, is the one who matters."
46,3,8,"The one who plants and the one who waters have the same goal, and each will receive a reward for his own work."
46,3,9,"For we are God's co-workers. You are God's farmland and God's building."
46,3,10,"As an expert builder using the grace that God gave me, I laid the foundation, and someone else is building on it. But each person must be careful how he builds on it."
46,3,11,"After all, no one can lay any other foundation than the one that is already laid, and that is Jesus Christ."
46,3,12,"Whether a person builds on this foundation with gold, silver, expensive stones, wood, hay, or straw,"
46,3,13,"the workmanship of each person will become evident, for the day will show what it is, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person's work."
46,3,14,"If what a person has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward."
46,3,15,"If his work is burned up, he will suffer loss. However, he himself will be saved, but it will be like going through fire."
46,3,16,"You know that you are God's sanctuary and that God's Spirit lives in you, don't you?"
46,3,17,"If anyone destroys God's sanctuary, God will destroy him, for God's sanctuary is holy. And you are that sanctuary!"
46,3,18,"Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in the ways of this world, he must become a fool to become really wise."
46,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is nonsense in God's sight. For it is written,	“He catches the wise with their own trickery,”"
46,3,20,"and again,	“The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are worthless.”"
46,3,21,"So let no one boast about men. For everything belongs to you,"
46,3,22,"whether Paul, Apollos, Cephas, the world, life, death, the present, or the future—everything belongs to you,"
46,3,23,"but you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God."
46,4,1,"A person should think of us as servants of Christ and managers entrusted with God's secrets."
46,4,2,"Now it is required of managers that each one should prove to be trustworthy."
46,4,3,"It is a very small thing to me that I should be examined by you or by any human court. In fact, I don't even examine myself."
46,4,4,"For my conscience is clear, but that does not vindicate me. It is the Lord who examines me."
46,4,5,"Therefore, stop judging before the proper time, before the Lord comes, for he will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and reveal the motives of our hearts. Then each person will receive his praise from God."
46,4,6,"Brothers, I have applied all this to Apollos and myself for your benefit, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written. Then you will stop boasting about one person at the expense of another."
46,4,7,"For who makes you superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not receive it?"
46,4,8,"You already have all you want! You have already become rich! You have become kings without us! I wish you really were kings so that we could be kings with you!"
46,4,9,"For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like men condemned to death. We have become a spectacle for the world, for angels, and for people to stare at."
46,4,10,"We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored."
46,4,11,"To this very hour we are hungry, thirsty, dressed in rags, brutally treated, and homeless."
46,4,12,"We wear ourselves out from working with our own hands. When insulted, we bless. When persecuted, we endure."
46,4,13,"When slandered, we answer with kind words. Up to this moment we have become the filth of the world, the scum of the universe!"
46,4,14,"I'm not writing this to make you feel ashamed, but to warn you as my dear children."
46,4,15,"You may have 10,000 guardians in Christ, but not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel."
46,4,16,"So I urge you to become imitators of me."
46,4,17,"That's why I sent Timothy to you. He is my dear and dependable child in the Lord and will help you remember my way of life in Christ Jesus as I teach it everywhere in every church."
46,4,18,"Some of you have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you."
46,4,19,"But I will come to you soon if it's the Lord's will. Then I'll discover not only what these arrogant people are saying but also what power they have,"
46,4,20,"for the kingdom of God isn't just talk but power."
46,4,21,"Which do you prefer? Should I come to you with a stick, or in love and with a gentle spirit?"
46,5,1,"It is actually reported that sexual immorality exists among you, and of a kind that is not found even among the Gentiles. A man is actually living with his father's wife!"
46,5,2,"And you are being arrogant instead of being filled with grief and seeing to it that the man who did this is removed from among you."
46,5,3,"Even though I am away from you physically, I am with you in spirit. I have already passed judgment on the man who did this, as though I were present with you."
46,5,4,"When you are gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus and my spirit and the power of our Lord Jesus are present,"
46,5,5,"hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the Day of the Lord."
46,5,6,"Your boasting is not good. You know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough, don't you?"
46,5,7,"Get rid of the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough, since you are to be free from yeast. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed."
46,5,8,"So let us keep celebrating the festival, not with the old yeast or with the yeast of vice and wickedness, but with the bread of purity and truth that has no yeast."
46,5,9,"I wrote to you in my letter to stop associating with people who are sexually immoral—"
46,5,10,"not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or greedy people, robbers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world."
46,5,11,"But now I am writing to you to stop associating with any so-called brother if he is sexually immoral, greedy, an idolater, a slanderer, a drunk, or a robber. With such a person you must even stop eating."
46,5,12,"After all, is it my business to judge outsiders? You are to judge those who are inside, aren't you?"
46,5,13,"God will judge outsiders. “Put that wicked man away from you.”"
46,6,1,"When one of you has a complaint against another, does he dare to take it before the unrighteous and not before the saints?"
46,6,2,"You know that the saints will rule the world, don't you? And if the world is going to be ruled by you, can't you handle insignificant cases?"
46,6,3,"You know that we will rule angels, not to mention things in this life, don't you?"
46,6,4,"So if you have cases dealing with this life, why do you appoint as judges people who have no standing in the church?"
46,6,5,"I say this to make you feel ashamed. Has it come to this, that there is not one person among you who is wise enough to settle disagreements between brothers?"
46,6,6,"Instead, one brother goes to court against another brother, and before unbelievers at that!"
46,6,7,"The very fact that you have lawsuits among yourselves is already a defeat for you. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?"
46,6,8,"Instead, you yourselves practice doing wrong and cheating others, and brothers at that!"
46,6,9,"You know that wicked people will not inherit the kingdom of God, don't you? Stop deceiving yourselves! Sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals,"
46,6,10,"thieves, greedy people, drunks, slanderers, and robbers will not inherit the kingdom of God."
46,6,11,"That is what some of you were! But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God."
46,6,12,"Everything is permissible for me, but not everything is helpful. Everything is permissible for me, but I will not allow anything to control me."
46,6,13,"Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food, but God will put an end to both of them. The body is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body."
46,6,14,"God raised the Lord, and by his power he will also raise us."
46,6,15,"You know that your bodies are parts of Christ, don't you? Should I take the parts of Christ and make them parts of a prostitute? Certainly not!"
46,6,16,"You know that the person who unites himself with a prostitute becomes one body with her, don't you? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.”"
46,6,17,"But the person who unites himself with the Lord becomes one spirit with him."
46,6,18,"Keep on running away from sexual immorality. Any other sin that a person commits is outside his body, but the person who sins sexually sins against his own body."
46,6,19,"You know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have received from God, don't you? You do not belong to yourselves,"
46,6,20,"because you were bought for a price. Therefore, glorify God with your bodies."
46,7,1,"Now concerning the things you wrote about: It's good for a man not to touch a woman."
46,7,2,"But because sexual immorality is so rampant, every man should have his own wife, and every woman should have her own husband."
46,7,3,"A husband should fulfill his obligation to his wife, and a wife should do the same for her husband."
46,7,4,"A wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does. In the same way, a husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but his wife does."
46,7,5,"Do not withhold yourselves from each other unless you agree to do so for a set time in order to devote yourselves to prayer. Then you should come together again so that Satan does not tempt you through your lack of self-control."
46,7,6,"But I say this as a concession, not as a command."
46,7,7,"I would like everyone to be like me. However, each person has a special gift from God, one this and another that."
46,7,8,"I say to those who are unmarried, especially to widows: It is good for them to remain like me."
46,7,9,"However, if they cannot control themselves, they should get married, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."
46,7,10,"To married people I give this command (not really I, but the Lord): A wife must not leave her husband."
46,7,11,"But if she does leave him, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. Likewise, a husband must not abandon his wife."
46,7,12,"I (not the Lord) say to the rest of you: If a brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she is willing to live with him, he must not abandon her."
46,7,13,"And if a woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he is willing to live with her, she must not abandon him."
46,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified because of her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy."
46,7,15,"But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him go. In such cases the brother or sister is not bound; God has called you to live in peace."
46,7,16,"Wife, how do you know whether you will save your husband? Husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?"
46,7,17,"Nevertheless, everyone should live the life that the Lord gave him and to which God called him. This is my rule in all the churches."
46,7,18,"Was anyone circumcised when he was called? He should not try to change that. Was anyone uncircumcised when he was called? He should not get circumcised."
46,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but obeying God's commandments is everything."
46,7,20,"Everyone should stay in the calling in which he was called."
46,7,21,"Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that bother you. Of course, if you have a chance to become free, take advantage of the opportunity."
46,7,22,"For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord's free person. In the same way, the free person who has been called is Christ's slave."
46,7,23,"You were bought for a price. Stop becoming slaves of people."
46,7,24,"Brothers, everyone should stay in the calling he was in when called by God."
46,7,25,"Now concerning virgins, although I do not have any command from the Lord, I will give you my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy."
46,7,26,"In view of the present crisis, I think it is prudent for a man to stay as he is."
46,7,27,"Have you been bound to a wife? Stop trying to get free. Have you been freed from a wife? Stop looking for a wife."
46,7,28,"But if you do get married, you have not sinned. And if a virgin gets married, she has not sinned. However, these people will experience distress in the flesh, and I want to spare you that."
46,7,29,"This is what I mean, brothers: The time has been shortened. From now on, those who have wives should live as though they had none,"
46,7,30,"and those who mourn as though they did not mourn, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did not own a thing,"
46,7,31,"and those who use the things in the world as though they were not dependent on them. For the world in its present form is passing away."
46,7,32,"I want you to be free from concerns. An unmarried man is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, that is, about how he can please the Lord."
46,7,33,"But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world, that is, about how he can please his wife,"
46,7,34,"and so his attention is divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, so that she may be holy in body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, that is, about how she can please her husband."
46,7,35,"I'm saying this for your benefit, not to put a noose around your necks, but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the Lord."
46,7,36,"If a man thinks he is not behaving properly toward his virgin, and if his passion is too strong and he feels he ought to, let him do what he wants; he isn't sinning. Let them get married."
46,7,37,"However, if a man stands firm in his resolve and feels no necessity but has made up his mind to keep her a virgin, he will be acting appropriately."
46,7,38,"So then the man who marries the virgin acts appropriately, but the man who refrains from marriage does even better."
46,7,39,"A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, only in the Lord."
46,7,40,"However, in my opinion she will be happier if she stays as she is. And I think that I, too, have God's Spirit."
46,8,1,"Now concerning food offered to idols: We know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."
46,8,2,"If anyone thinks he knows something, he has not yet learned it as he ought to know it."
46,8,3,"But if anyone loves God, he is known by him."
46,8,4,"Now concerning eating food offered to idols: We know that no idol is real in the world and that there is only one God."
46,8,5,"For even if there are “gods” in heaven and on earth (as indeed there are many so-called “gods” and “lords”),"
46,8,6,"yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom everything came into being and for whom we live. And there is only one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom everything came into being and through whom we live."
46,8,7,"But not everyone has this knowledge. Some people are so accustomed to idols that they still think they are eating food offered to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it becomes contaminated."
46,8,8,"However, food will not bring us closer to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do."
46,8,9,"But you must see to it that this right of yours does not become a stumbling block to the weak."
46,8,10,"For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol's temple, he will be encouraged to eat what has been offered to idols, won't he?"
46,8,11,"In that case, the weak brother for whom Christ died is destroyed by your knowledge."
46,8,12,"When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak consciences, you are sinning against Christ."
46,8,13,"Therefore, if food causes my brother to fall, I will never eat meat again, in order to keep my brother from falling."
46,9,1,"I am free, am I not? I am an apostle, am I not? I have seen Jesus our Lord, haven't I? You are my work in the Lord, aren't you?"
46,9,2,"If I am not an apostle to other people, surely I am one to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord!"
46,9,3,"This is my defense to those who would examine me:"
46,9,4,"We have the right to eat and drink, don't we?"
46,9,5,"We have the right to take a believing wife with us like the other apostles, the Lord's brothers, and Cephas, don't we?"
46,9,6,"Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?"
46,9,7,"Who would ever go to war at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its grapes? Or who takes care of a flock and does not drink any of its milk?"
46,9,8,"I am not saying this on human authority, am I? The law says the same thing, doesn't it?"
46,9,9,"For in the law of Moses it is written, “You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” God is not only concerned about oxen, is he?"
46,9,10,"Isn't he really speaking on our behalf? Yes, this was written on our behalf, because the one who plows should plow in hope, and the one who threshes should thresh in hope of sharing in the crop."
46,9,11,"If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap material benefits from you?"
46,9,12,"If others enjoy this right over you, don't we have a stronger claim? But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with everything in order not to put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ."
46,9,13,"You know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple and that those who serve at the altar get their share of its offerings, don't you?"
46,9,14,"In the same way, the Lord has ordered that those who proclaim the gospel should make their living from the gospel."
46,9,15,"But I have not used any of these rights, and I'm not writing this so that they may be applied in my case. I would rather die than let anyone deprive me of my reason for boasting."
46,9,16,"For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast about, for this obligation has been laid on me. How terrible it would be for me if I didn't preach the gospel!"
46,9,17,"For if I do this voluntarily, I get a reward, but if I am unwilling to do it, I am still entrusted with an obligation."
46,9,18,"What, then, is my reward? It's to be able to preach the gospel free of charge, and so never resort to using my rights in the gospel."
46,9,19,"Although I am free from all people, I made myself a slave to all of them to win more of them."
46,9,20,"To the Jews I became like a Jew in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became like a man under the law, in order to win those under the law (although I myself am not under the law)."
46,9,21,"To those who do not have the law I became like a man who does not have the law, in order to win those who do not have the law (although I am not free from God's law, but am under the law of Christ)."
46,9,22,"To the weak I became weak in order to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some of them."
46,9,23,"I do all this for the sake of the gospel in order to have a share in its blessings."
46,9,24,"You know that in a race all the runners run but only one wins the prize, don't you? You must run in such a way that you may be victorious."
46,9,25,"Everyone who enters an athletic contest practices self-control in everything. They do it to win a wreath that dies, but we to win one that never dies."
46,9,26,"That is the way I run, with a clear goal in mind. That is the way I box, not like someone punching the air."
46,9,27,"No, I keep on beating my body and making it my slave so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not somehow be disqualified."
46,10,1,"For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of the fact that all of our ancestors were under the cloud, and they all went through the sea,"
46,10,2,"and they all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,"
46,10,3,"and they all ate the same spiritual food,"
46,10,4,"and they all drank the same spiritual drink, for they continually drank from the spiritual Rock that went with them, and that Rock was Christ."
46,10,5,"But God wasn't pleased with most of them, and so they were struck down in the wilderness."
46,10,6,"Now these things became examples for us so that we won't set our hearts on evil as they did."
46,10,7,"Let us stop being idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to play.”"
46,10,8,"Let us stop sinning sexually, as some of them were doing, and on a single day 23,000 fell dead."
46,10,9,"Let us stop putting the Lord to the test, as some of them were doing, and were destroyed by snakes."
46,10,10,"You must stop complaining, as some of them were doing, and were destroyed by the destroying angel."
46,10,11,"These things happened to them to serve as an example, and they were written down as a warning for us in whom the climax of the ages has been realized."
46,10,12,"Therefore, the person who thinks he is standing securely should watch out that he does not fall."
46,10,13,"No temptation has overtaken you that is unusual for human beings. But God is faithful, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength. Instead, along with the temptation he will also provide a way out, so that you may be able to endure it."
46,10,14,"And so, my dear friends, keep on running away from idolatry."
46,10,15,"I am talking to sensible people. Decide for yourselves what I am saying."
46,10,16,"The cup of blessing that we bless is a sign of our sharing in the blood of Christ, isn't it? The bread that we break is a sign of our sharing in the body of Christ, isn't it?"
46,10,17,"Because there is one loaf, we who are many are one body, because all of us partake of the one loaf."
46,10,18,"Look at the Israelites from a human point of view. Those who eat the sacrifices share in what is on the altar, don't they?"
46,10,19,"Am I suggesting that an offering made to idols means anything, or that an idol itself means anything?"
46,10,20,"Hardly! What they offer, they offer to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to become partners with demons."
46,10,21,"You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot eat at the table of the Lord and at the table of demons."
46,10,22,"Are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than he is, are we?"
46,10,23,"Everything is permissible, but not everything is helpful. Everything is permissible, but not everything builds up."
46,10,24,"No one should seek his own welfare, but rather his neighbor's."
46,10,25,"Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without raising any question about it on the ground of conscience,"
46,10,26,"for “the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord.”"
46,10,27,"If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you wish to go, eat whatever is set before you, raising no question on the ground of conscience."
46,10,28,"However, if someone says to you, “This was offered in sacrifice,” don't eat it, both out of consideration for the one who told you and because of conscience."
46,10,29,"I mean, of course, his conscience, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by someone else's conscience?"
46,10,30,"If I eat with thankfulness, why should I be denounced because of what I am thankful for?"
46,10,31,"Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything to the glory of God."
46,10,32,"Stop being stumbling blocks to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God,"
46,10,33,"just as I myself try to please everybody in every way, not looking for my own advantage but for that of many people, so that they might be saved."
46,11,1,"Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ."
46,11,2,"I praise you for remembering me in everything and for carefully following the traditions, just as I passed them on to you."
46,11,3,"Now I want you to realize that Christ is the head of every man, and man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ."
46,11,4,"Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head dishonors his head,"
46,11,5,"and every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, which is the same as having her head shaved."
46,11,6,"So if a woman does not cover her head, she should cut off her hair. If it is a disgrace for a woman to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her own head."
46,11,7,"A man should not cover his own head, because he exists as God's image and glory. But the woman is man's glory."
46,11,8,"For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;"
46,11,9,"and man was not created for woman, but woman for man."
46,11,10,"This is why a woman should have authority over her own head: because of the angels."
46,11,11,"In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man of woman."
46,11,12,"For as woman came from man, so man comes through woman. But everything comes from God."
46,11,13,"Decide for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?"
46,11,14,"Nature itself teaches you neither that it is disgraceful for a man to have long hair"
46,11,15,"nor that hair is a woman's glory, for hair is given as a substitute for coverings."
46,11,16,"But if anyone wants to argue about this, we do not have any custom like this, nor do any of God's churches."
46,11,17,"Now I am not praising you in giving you the following instructions. When you gather, it is not for the better but for the worse."
46,11,18,"For in the first place, I hear that when you gather as a church there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it."
46,11,19,"Of course, there must be factions among you to show which of you are genuine!"
46,11,20,"When you gather in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper."
46,11,21,"For as you eat, each of you rushes to eat his own supper, and one person goes hungry while another gets drunk."
46,11,22,"You have homes in which to eat and drink, don't you? Or do you despise God's church and humiliate those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I will not praise you for this!"
46,11,23,"For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you—how the Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took a loaf of bread,"
46,11,24,"gave thanks for it, and broke it in pieces, saying,"
46,11,25,"He did the same with the cup after the supper, saying,"
46,11,26,"For as often as you eat this bread and drink from this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."
46,11,27,"Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks from the cup in an unworthy manner will be held responsible for the Lord's body and blood."
46,11,28,"A person must examine himself and then eat the bread and drink from the cup."
46,11,29,"For the one who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself."
46,11,30,"That's why so many of you are weak and sick and a considerable number are dying."
46,11,31,"But if we judged ourselves correctly, we would not be judged."
46,11,32,"Now, while we are being judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined lest we be condemned along with the world."
46,11,33,"Therefore, my brothers, when you gather to eat, wait for each other."
46,11,34,"If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you gather it may not bring judgment on you. And when I come I will give instructions concerning the other matters."
46,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I don't want you to be ignorant."
46,12,2,"You know that when you were Gentiles, you were enticed and led away to idols that couldn't even speak."
46,12,3,"Therefore, I want you to know that no one who is speaking by God's Spirit can say, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit."
46,12,4,"Now there are varieties of gifts, but the Spirit is the same;"
46,12,5,"and there are varieties of ministries, but the Lord is the same;"
46,12,6,"and there are varieties of results, but God is the same, and it is he who produces all the results in everyone."
46,12,7,"To each person has been given the ability to display the Spirit for the common good."
46,12,8,"To one has been given a message of wisdom by the Spirit; to another the ability to speak with knowledge according to the same Spirit;"
46,12,9,"to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit;"
46,12,10,"to another miraculous results; to another prophecy; to another the ability to distinguish between spirits; to another various kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues."
46,12,11,"But one and the same Spirit produces all these results and gives what he wants to each person."
46,12,12,"For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though many, form one body, so it is with Christ."
46,12,13,"For by one Spirit all of us—Jews and Greeks, slaves and free—were baptized into one body and were all privileged to drink from one Spirit."
46,12,14,"For the body does not consist of only one part, but of many."
46,12,15,"If the foot says, “Since I'm not a hand, I'm not part of the body,” that does not make it any less a part of the body, does it?"
46,12,16,"And if the ear says, “Since I'm not an eye, I'm not part of the body,” that does not make it any less a part of the body, does it?"
46,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?"
46,12,18,"But at this very time God has arranged the parts, every one of them, in the body just as he wanted to."
46,12,19,"Now if they were all one part, where would the body be?"
46,12,20,"So there are many parts, but one body."
46,12,21,"The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don't need you,” or the head to the feet, “I don't need you.”"
46,12,22,"On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are in fact indispensable,"
46,12,23,"and the parts of the body that we think are less honorable are treated with special honor, and we make our less attractive parts more attractive."
46,12,24,"However, our attractive parts don't need this. But God has put the body together and has given special honor to the parts that lack it,"
46,12,25,"so that there might be no disharmony in the body, but that its parts should have the same concern for each other."
46,12,26,"If one part suffers, every part suffers with it. If one part is praised, every part rejoices with it."
46,12,27,"Now you are Christ's body and individual parts of it."
46,12,28,"God has appointed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then those who perform miracles, those who have gifts of healing, those who help others, administrators, and various kinds of tongues."
46,12,29,"Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform miracles, do they?"
46,12,30,"Not all have the gift of healing, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do they?"
46,12,31,"Keep on desiring the better gifts. And now I will show you the best way of all."
46,13,1,"If I speak in the tongues of humans and angels but have no love, I have become a reverberating gong or a clashing cymbal."
46,13,2,"If I have the gift of prophecy and can understand all secrets and every form of knowledge, and if I have absolute faith so as to move mountains but have no love, I am nothing."
46,13,3,"Even if I give away all that I have and surrender my body so that I may boast but have no love, I get nothing out of it."
46,13,4,"Love is always patient,	Love is always kind,	Love is never envious	Or vaunted up with pride.	Nor is she conceited,"
46,13,5,"And never is she rude,	Never does she think of self	Or ever get annoyed.	She never is resentful,"
46,13,6,"Is never glad with sin,	But always glad to side with truth,	Whene'er the truth should win."
46,13,7,"She bears up under everything,	Believes the best in all,	There is no limit to her hope,	And never will she fall."
46,13,8,"Love never fails. Now if there are prophecies, they will be done away with. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will be done away with."
46,13,9,"For what we know is incomplete and what we prophesy is incomplete."
46,13,10,"But when what is complete comes, then what is incomplete will be done away with."
46,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, and reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up my childish ways."
46,13,12,"Now we see only a blurred reflection in a mirror, but then we will see face to face. Now what I know is incomplete, but then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known."
46,13,13,"Right now three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love."
46,14,1,"Keep on pursuing love, and keep on desiring spiritual gifts, especially the ability to prophesy."
46,14,2,"For the person who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands him, because he is speaking secrets in the Spirit."
46,14,3,"But the person who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding, encouragement, and comfort."
46,14,4,"The person who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but the person who prophesies builds the church up."
46,14,5,"Now I wish that all of you could speak in tongues, but especially that you could prophesy. The person who prophesies is more important than the person who speaks in a tongue, unless he interprets it so that the church may be built up."
46,14,6,"Indeed, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what good will I be to you unless I speak to you in some revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching?"
46,14,7,"In the same way, lifeless instruments like the flute or harp produce sounds. But if there's no difference in the notes, how can a person tell what tune is being played?"
46,14,8,"For example, if a bugle doesn't sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?"
46,14,9,"In the same way, unless you speak an intelligible message with your tongue, how will anyone know what is being said? You'll be talking into the air!"
46,14,10,"There are, I suppose, many different languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning."
46,14,11,"If I don't know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker will be a foreigner to me."
46,14,12,"In the same way, since you're so desirous of spiritual gifts, you must keep on desiring them for the upbuilding of the church."
46,14,13,"Therefore, the person who speaks in a tongue should pray for the ability to interpret it."
46,14,14,"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is not productive."
46,14,15,"What does this mean? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing psalms with my spirit, but I will also sing psalms with my mind."
46,14,16,"Otherwise, if you say a blessing with your spirit, how can an otherwise uneducated person say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you're saying?"
46,14,17,"It's good for you to give thanks, but it does not build up the other person."
46,14,18,"I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you."
46,14,19,"But in church I would rather speak five words with my mind to instruct others than 10,000 words in a tongue."
46,14,20,"Brothers, stop being children in your thinking. In evil be infants, but in thinking be adults."
46,14,21,"In the law it is written,	“Through people of strange tonguesand through the mouths of foreigners	I will speak to this people,but even then they will not listen to me,”declares the Lord."
46,14,22,"Tongues, then, are meant to be a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers, while prophecy is meant, not for unbelievers, but for believers."
46,14,23,"Now if the whole church gathers in the same place and everyone is speaking in tongues, when uneducated people or unbelievers come in, they will say that you are out of your mind, won't they?"
46,14,24,"But if everyone is prophesying, when an unbeliever or an uneducated person comes in he will be convicted by all and examined by all."
46,14,25,"The secrets in his heart will become known, and so he will bow down to the ground and worship God, declaring, “God is truly among you!”"
46,14,26,"What, then, does this mean, brothers? When you gather, everyone has a psalm, teaching, revelation, tongue, or interpretation. Everything must be done for upbuilding."
46,14,27,"If anyone speaks in a tongue, only two or three at the most should do so, one at a time, and somebody must interpret."
46,14,28,"If an interpreter is not present, he should remain silent in the church and speak to himself and God."
46,14,29,"Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said."
46,14,30,"If a revelation is made to another person who is seated, the first person should be silent."
46,14,31,"For everyone can prophesy in turn, so that everyone can be instructed and everyone can be encouraged."
46,14,32,"The spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets,"
46,14,33,"for God is not a God of disorder but of peace.As in all the churches of the saints,"
46,14,34,"the women must keep silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak out, but must place themselves in submission, as the law also says."
46,14,35,"If they want to learn anything, they should ask their own husbands at home, for it is inappropriate for a woman to speak out in church."
46,14,36,"Did God's word originate with you? Are you the only people it has reached?"
46,14,37,"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or a spiritual person, he must acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command."
46,14,38,"But if anyone ignores this, he should be ignored."
46,14,39,"Therefore, my brothers, desire the ability to prophesy, and do not prevent others from speaking in tongues."
46,14,40,"But everything must be done in a proper and orderly way."
46,15,1,"Now I'm making known to you, brothers, the gospel that I proclaimed to you, which you accepted, on which you have taken your stand,"
46,15,2,"and by which you are also being saved if you hold firmly to the message I proclaimed to you—unless, of course, your faith was worthless."
46,15,3,"For I passed on to you the most important points of what I received: Christ died for our sins in keeping with the Scriptures,"
46,15,4,"he was buried, he was raised on the third day in keeping with the Scriptures—and is still alive!—"
46,15,5,"and he was seen by Cephas, and then by the twelve."
46,15,6,"After that, he was seen by more than 500 brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died."
46,15,7,"Next he was seen by James, then by all the apostles,"
46,15,8,"and finally he was seen by me, as though I were born abnormally late."
46,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles and not even fit to be called an apostle because I persecuted God's church."
46,15,10,"But by God's grace I am what I am, and his grace shown to me was not wasted. Instead, I worked harder than all the others—not I, of course, but God's grace that was with me."
46,15,11,"So, whether it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed."
46,15,12,"Now if we preach that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you keep claiming there is no resurrection of the dead?"
46,15,13,"If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised,"
46,15,14,"and if Christ has not been raised, then our message means nothing and your faith means nothing."
46,15,15,"In addition, we are found to be false witnesses about God because we testified on God's behalf that he raised Christ—whom he did not raise if in fact it is true that the dead are not raised."
46,15,16,"For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised,"
46,15,17,"and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless and you are still in your sins."
46,15,18,"Yes, even those who have died in Christ are lost."
46,15,19,"If we have set our hopes on Christ in this life only, we deserve more pity than any other people."
46,15,20,"But at this moment Christ stands risen from the dead, the first one offered in the harvest of those who have died."
46,15,21,"For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also came through a man."
46,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ will all be made alive."
46,15,23,"However, this will happen to each person in the proper order: first Christ, then those who belong to Christ when he comes."
46,15,24,"Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has done away with every ruler and every authority and power."
46,15,25,"For he must rule until God puts all his enemies under his feet."
46,15,26,"The last enemy to be done away with is death,"
46,15,27,"for “God has put everything under his feet.” Now when he says, “Everything has been put under him,” this clearly excludes the one who put everything under him."
46,15,28,"But when everything has been put under him, then the Son himself will also become subject to the one who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all."
46,15,29,"Otherwise, what will those people do who are being baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are they being baptized for them?"
46,15,30,"And why in fact are we being endangered every hour?"
46,15,31,"I face death every day! That is as certain, brothers, as it is that I am proud of you in Christ Jesus our Lord."
46,15,32,"If I have fought with wild animals in Ephesus from merely human motives, what do I get out of it? If the dead are not raised,	“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”"
46,15,33,"Stop being deceived:	“Wicked friends lead to evil ends.”"
46,15,34,"Come back to your senses as you should, and stop sinning! For some of you—I say this to your shame—are without a true knowledge of God."
46,15,35,"But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have when they come back?”"
46,15,36,"You fool! The seed you plant does not come to life unless it dies,"
46,15,37,"and what you plant is not the form that it will be, but a bare kernel, whether it is wheat or something else."
46,15,38,"But God gives the plant the form he wants it to have, and to each kind of seed its own form."
46,15,39,"Not all flesh is the same. Humans have one kind of flesh, animals in general have another, birds have another, and fish have still another."
46,15,40,"There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendor of those in heaven is of one kind, and that of those on earth is of another."
46,15,41,"One kind of splendor belongs to the sun, another to the moon, and still another to the stars. In fact, one star differs from another star in splendor."
46,15,42,"This is how it will be at the resurrection of the dead. What is planted is decaying, what is raised cannot decay."
46,15,43,"The body is planted in dishonor but raised in splendor. It is planted in weakness but raised in power."
46,15,44,"It is planted a physical body but raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body."
46,15,45,"This, indeed, is what is written: “The first man, Adam, became a living being.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit."
46,15,46,"The spiritual does not come first, but the physical and then the spiritual."
46,15,47,"The first man came from the dust of the earth; the second man came from heaven."
46,15,48,"Those who are made of the dust are like the man from the dust, those who are heavenly are like the man who is from heaven."
46,15,49,"Just as we have borne the likeness of the man who was made from dust, we will also bear the likeness of the man from heaven."
46,15,50,"Brothers, this is what I mean: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and what decays cannot inherit what does not decay."
46,15,51,"Let me tell you a secret. Not all of us will die, but all of us will be changed—"
46,15,52,"in a moment, in the blinking of an eye, at the sound of the last trumpet. Indeed, that trumpet will sound, and then the dead will be raised never to decay, and we will be changed."
46,15,53,"For what is decaying must put on what cannot decay, and what is dying must put on what cannot die."
46,15,54,"Now, when what is decaying puts on what cannot decay, and what is dying puts on what cannot die, then the saying that is written will be fulfilled: “Death has been swallowed up in victory!”"
46,15,55,"“Where, O death, is your victory?Where, O death, is your sting?”"
46,15,56,"Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law."
46,15,57,"But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!"
46,15,58,"Therefore, my dear brothers, be steadfast, unmovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, because you know that your work isn't wasted in the Lord."
46,16,1,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, you should follow the directions I gave to the churches in Galatia."
46,16,2,"On the first day of the week, each of you should set aside and save some of your money in proportion to what you have, so that no collections will have to be made when I come."
46,16,3,"When I arrive, I will send with letters the men you approve to take your gift to Jerusalem."
46,16,4,"If it is worthwhile for me to go, too, they can go with me."
46,16,5,"I will visit you when I go through Macedonia—for I intend to go through Macedonia—"
46,16,6,"and will probably stay with you or even spend the winter. Then you can send me on my way, wherever I decide to go."
46,16,7,"I do not want to see you now just in passing, because I hope to spend some time with you if the Lord permits."
46,16,8,"However, I will be staying on in Ephesus until Pentecost,"
46,16,9,"because a door has opened wide for me to do effective work, although many people are opposing me."
46,16,10,"If Timothy comes, see to it that he does not have anything to be afraid of while he is with you, for he is doing the Lord's work as I am."
46,16,11,"Therefore, no one should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me, because I am expecting him along with the brothers."
46,16,12,"Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but he was not inclined to go just now. However, he will come when the time is right."
46,16,13,"Remain alert. Keep standing firm in your faith. Keep on being courageous and strong."
46,16,14,"Everything you do should be done in love."
46,16,15,"Now I urge you, brothers—for you know that the members of the family of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to serving the saints—"
46,16,16,"to submit yourselves to people like these and to anyone else who shares their labor and hard work."
46,16,17,"I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus came here, because they have supplied what was lacking from you."
46,16,18,"They refreshed my spirit—and yours, too. Therefore, appreciate men like that."
46,16,19,"The churches in Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca and the church in their house greet you warmly in the Lord."
46,16,20,"All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.,"
46,16,21,"I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand."
46,16,22,"If anyone doesn't love the Lord, let him be condemned! May our Lord come!"
46,16,23,"May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you!"
46,16,24,"My love is with all of you in Christ Jesus."
47,1,1,"From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth, with all the holy people throughout Achaia."
47,1,2,"May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!"
47,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He is the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort,"
47,1,4,"who comforts us in all our suffering, so that we may be able to comfort others in all their suffering, since we ourselves are being comforted by God."
47,1,5,"For just as Christ's sufferings overflow to us, so our comfort overflows through Christ."
47,1,6,"If we suffer, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we are suffering."
47,1,7,"Our hope for you is unshaken, because we know that as you share our sufferings, you also share our comfort."
47,1,8,"For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about the suffering we experienced in Asia. We were so crushed beyond our ability to endure that we even despaired of living."
47,1,9,"In fact, we felt within ourselves that we had received the sentence of death, so that we would not rely on ourselves but on the God who raises the dead."
47,1,10,"He has rescued us from a terrible death, and he will continue to rescue us. Yes, the one on whom we have set our hope will rescue us again,"
47,1,11,"as you also help us by your prayers on our behalf. Then prayers of thanksgiving will be uttered by many people on our behalf because of the favor shown us through the prayers of many."
47,1,12,"For this is what we boast about: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world with pure motives and godly sincerity, without earthly wisdom but with God's grace—and especially towards you."
47,1,13,"For what we are writing you is nothing more than what you can read and also understand. I hope you will understand completely,"
47,1,14,"just as you have already understood us partially, so that on the day of our Lord Jesus we can be your reason to boast, even as you are ours."
47,1,15,"It was because of this confidence that I planned to come to you first, so that you might receive a double blessing."
47,1,16,"I planned to leave you in order to go to Macedonia, and then come back to you from Macedonia, and let you send me on to Judea."
47,1,17,"When I planned this, I did not do it lightly, did I? Are my plans so fickle that I can say “Yes” and “No” at the same time?"
47,1,18,"As certainly as God is faithful, our word to you is not “Yes” and “No.”"
47,1,19,"For God's Son, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me, Silvanus, and Timothy—was not “Yes” and “No.” But with him it is always “Yes.”"
47,1,20,"For all God's promises are “Yes” in him. And so through him we can say “Amen,” to the glory of God."
47,1,21,"Now the one who makes us—and you as well—secure in union with Christ and has anointed us is God,"
47,1,22,"who has placed his seal on us and has given us the Spirit in our hearts as a down payment."
47,1,23,"I call upon God as a witness on my behalf that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth."
47,1,24,"It is not that we are trying to lord it over your faith. On the contrary, we are workers with you to promote your joy, because you have been standing firm in the faith."
47,2,1,"Now I decided not to pay you another painful visit."
47,2,2,"After all, if I were to grieve you, who should make me happy but the person I am making sad?"
47,2,3,"This is the very reason I wrote you, so that when I did come I might not be made sad by those who should have made me happy. For I had confidence in all of you that my gladness would be for all of you."
47,2,4,"For I wrote to you out of great sorrow and anguish of heart—along with many tears—not to make you sad but to let you know how much love I have for you."
47,2,5,"But if anyone has caused grief, he didn't cause me any grief. To some extent—I don't want to emphasize this too much—it has affected all of you."
47,2,6,"This punishment by the majority is severe enough for such a man."
47,2,7,"So forgive and comfort him, or else he will drown in his excessive grief."
47,2,8,"That's why I'm urging you to assure him of your love."
47,2,9,"I had also written to you to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in every way."
47,2,10,"When you forgive someone, I do, too. Indeed, what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I did in the presence of Christ for your benefit,"
47,2,11,"so that we may not be outsmarted by Satan. After all, we are not unaware of his intentions."
47,2,12,"When I went to Troas on behalf of the gospel of Christ, a door in fact stood wide open for me in the Lord."
47,2,13,"But my spirit could not find any relief, because I couldn't find Titus, my brother. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia."
47,2,14,"But thanks be to God! He always leads us triumphantly in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of knowing him."
47,2,15,"To God we are the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are being lost."
47,2,16,"To some people we are a deadly fragrance, while to others we are a living fragrance. Who is qualified for this?"
47,2,17,"At least we are not commercializing God's word like so many others. Instead, in Christ we speak with sincerity, like people who are sent from God and are accountable to God."
47,3,1,"Are we beginning to recommend ourselves again? Unlike some people, we do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, do we?"
47,3,2,"You are our letter, written in our hearts and known and read by everyone."
47,3,3,"You are demonstrating that you are Christ's letter, produced by our service, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts."
47,3,4,"Such is the confidence that we have in God through Christ."
47,3,5,"By ourselves we are not qualified to claim that anything comes from us. Rather, our credentials come from God,"
47,3,6,"who has also qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant, which is not written but spiritual, because the written text brings death, but the Spirit gives life."
47,3,7,"Now if the ministry of death that was inscribed in letters of stone came with such glory that the people of Israel could not gaze on Moses’ face (because the glory was fading away from it),"
47,3,8,"will not the Spirit's ministry have even more glory?"
47,3,9,"For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, then the ministry of justification has an overwhelming glory."
47,3,10,"In fact, that which once had glory lost its glory, because the other glory surpassed it."
47,3,11,"For if that which fades away came through glory, how much more does that which is permanent have glory?"
47,3,12,"Therefore, since we have such a hope, we speak with great boldness,"
47,3,13,"not like Moses, who kept covering his face with a veil to keep the people of Israel from gazing at the end of what was fading away."
47,3,14,"However, their minds were hardened, for to this day the same veil is still there when they read the old covenant. Only in union with Christ is that veil removed."
47,3,15,"Yet even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts."
47,3,16,"But whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is removed."
47,3,17,"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Lord's Spirit is, there is freedom."
47,3,18,"As all of us reflect the glory of the Lord with unveiled faces, we are being transformed into the same image with ever-increasing glory by the Lord's Spirit."
47,4,1,"Therefore, since we have this ministry through the mercy shown to us, we do not get discouraged."
47,4,2,"Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful ways. We do not use trickery or pervert God's word. By clear statements of the truth we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience before God."
47,4,3,"So if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are dying."
47,4,4,"In their case, the god of this world has blinded the minds of those who do not believe to keep them from seeing the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God."
47,4,5,"For we do not preach ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as merely your servants for Jesus’ sake."
47,4,6,"For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” has shone in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory in the face of Jesus Christ."
47,4,7,"But we have this treasure in clay jars to show that its extraordinary power comes from God and not from us."
47,4,8,"In every way we're troubled but not crushed, frustrated but not in despair,"
47,4,9,"persecuted but not abandoned, struck down but not destroyed."
47,4,10,"We are always carrying around the death of Jesus in our bodies, so that the life of Jesus may be clearly shown in our bodies."
47,4,11,"While we are alive, we are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may be clearly shown in our dying bodies."
47,4,12,"And so death is at work in us, but life is at work in you."
47,4,13,"Now since we have the same spirit of faith in keeping with what is written—“I believed, and so I spoke”—we also believe, and so we speak."
47,4,14,"We know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and present us to God together with you."
47,4,15,"All this is for your sake so that, as his grace spreads, it will increase the thanksgiving of more and more people to the glory of God."
47,4,16,"That's why we are not discouraged. No, even if our outer man is wearing out, our inner man is being renewed day by day."
47,4,17,"This light, temporary nature of our suffering is producing for us an eternal weight of glory, far beyond any comparison,"
47,4,18,"because we do not look for things that can be seen but for things that cannot be seen. For things that can be seen are temporary, but things that cannot be seen are eternal."
47,5,1,"We know that if the earthly tent we live in is torn down, we have a building in heaven that comes from God, an eternal house not built by human hands."
47,5,2,"For in this one we sigh, since we long to put on our heavenly dwelling."
47,5,3,"Of course, if we do put it on, we will not be found without a body."
47,5,4,"So while we are still in this tent, we sigh under our burdens, because we do not want to put it off but to put it on, so that our dying bodies may be swallowed up by life."
47,5,5,"God has prepared us for this and has given us his Spirit as a guarantee."
47,5,6,"Therefore, we are always confident, and we know that as long as we are at home in this body we are away from the Lord."
47,5,7,"For we live by faith, not by sight."
47,5,8,"We are confident, then, and would prefer to be away from this body and to live with the Lord."
47,5,9,"So whether we are at home or away from home, our goal is to be pleasing to him."
47,5,10,"For all of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us may receive what he deserves for what he has done in his body, whether good or worthless."
47,5,11,"Therefore, since we know the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade people. We ourselves are perfectly known to God. I hope we are also really known to your consciences."
47,5,12,"We are not recommending ourselves to you again but are giving you a reason to be proud of us, so that you can answer those who are proud of outward things rather than inward character."
47,5,13,"So if we were crazy, it was for God; if we are sane, it is for you."
47,5,14,"The love of Christ controls us, for we are convinced of this: that one person died for all people; therefore, all people have died."
47,5,15,"He died for all people, so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for the one who died and rose for them."
47,5,16,"So then, from now on we do not think of anyone from a human point of view. Even if we did think of Christ from a human point of view, we don't think of him that way any more."
47,5,17,"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things have disappeared, and—look!—all things have become new!"
47,5,18,"All of this comes from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation."
47,5,19,"For in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself by not counting their sins against them, and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation."
47,5,20,"Therefore, we are Christ's representatives, as though God were pleading through us. We plead on Christ's behalf: “Be reconciled to God!”"
47,5,21,"God made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that we might become God's righteousness in him."
47,6,1,"Since, then, we are working with God, we plead with you not to accept God's grace in vain."
47,6,2,"For he says,	“At the right time I heard you,			and on a day of salvation I helped you.”Listen, now is really the “right time”! Now is the “day of salvation”!"
47,6,3,"We do not put an obstacle in anyone's way. Otherwise, fault may be found with our ministry."
47,6,4,"Instead, in every way we demonstrate that we are God's servants by tremendous endurance in the midst of difficulties, hardships, and calamities;"
47,6,5,"in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights, and hunger;"
47,6,6,"with purity, knowledge, patience, and kindness; with the Holy Spirit, genuine love,"
47,6,7,"truthful speech, and divine power; through the weapons of righteousness in the right and left hands;"
47,6,8,"through honor and dishonor; through ill repute and good repute; perceived as deceivers and yet true,"
47,6,9,"as unknown and yet well-known, as dying and yet—as you see—very much alive, as punished and yet not killed,"
47,6,10,"as sorrowful and yet always rejoicing, as poor and yet enriching many, as having nothing and yet possessing everything."
47,6,11,"We have spoken frankly to you, Corinthians. Our hearts are wide open."
47,6,12,"We have not cut you off, but you have cut off your own feelings toward us."
47,6,13,"Do us a favor—I ask you as my children—and open wide your hearts."
47,6,14,"Stop becoming unevenly yoked with unbelievers. What partnership can righteousness have with lawlessness? What fellowship can light have with darkness?"
47,6,15,"What harmony exists between Christ and Beliar, or what do a believer and an unbeliever have in common?"
47,6,16,"What agreement can a temple of God make with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said:	“I will live and walk among them.I will be their God,and they will be my people.”"
47,6,17,"Therefore,	“Get away from themand separate yourselves from them,”declares the Lord,	“and don't touch anything unclean.Then I will welcome you."
47,6,18,"I will be your Father,and you will be my sons and daughters,”declares the Lord Almighty."
47,7,1,"Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit by perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
47,7,2,"Make room for us in your hearts! We have not treated anyone unjustly, harmed anyone, or cheated anyone."
47,7,3,"I am not saying this to condemn you. I told you before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together."
47,7,4,"I have great confidence in you. I am very proud of you. I am very much encouraged. I am overjoyed in all our troubles."
47,7,5,"For even when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest. We suffered in a number of ways. Outwardly there were conflicts, inwardly there were fears."
47,7,6,"Yet God, who comforts those who feel miserable, comforted us by the arrival of Titus,"
47,7,7,"and not only by his arrival but also by the comfort he had received from you. He told us about your longing for me, your sorrow, and your eagerness to take my side, and this made me even happier."
47,7,8,"If I made you sad with my letter, I do not regret it, although I did regret it then. I see that the letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while."
47,7,9,"Now I am happy, not because you had such sorrow, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you were sorry in a godly way, and so you were not hurt by us in any way."
47,7,10,"For having sorrow in a godly way results in repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regrets. But the sorrow of the world produces death."
47,7,11,"See what great earnestness godly sorrow has produced in you! How ready you are to clear yourselves, how indignant, how alarmed, how full of longing and enthusiasm, how eager to seek justice! In every way you have demonstrated that you are innocent in this matter."
47,7,12,"So, even though I wrote to you, it wasn't because of the man who did the wrong or because of the man who was hurt. Instead, I wrote to you so that your devotion to us might be made perfectly clear to you before God."
47,7,13,"This is what comforted us. In addition to our own comfort, we were even more delighted at the joy of Titus, because his spirit had been set at rest by all of you."
47,7,14,"For if I have been doing some boasting about you to him, I have never been ashamed of it. Moreover, since everything we told you was true, our boasting to Titus has also proved to be true."
47,7,15,"His heart goes out to you even more as he remembers how obedient all of you were and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling."
47,7,16,"I rejoice that I can have complete confidence in you."
47,8,1,"We want you to know, brothers, about God's grace that was given to the churches of Macedonia."
47,8,2,"In spite of a terrible ordeal of suffering, their abundant joy, along with their deep poverty, has resulted in the abundance of their generosity."
47,8,3,"I can testify that by their own free will they have given to the utmost of their ability, yes, even beyond their ability."
47,8,4,"They begged us earnestly for the privilege of participating in this ministry to the saints."
47,8,5,"We did not expect that! They gave themselves to the Lord first and then to us, since this was God's will."
47,8,6,"So we urged Titus to finish this work of kindness among you in the same way that he had started it."
47,8,7,"Indeed, the more your faith, speech, knowledge, enthusiasm, and love for us increase, the more we want you to be rich in this work of kindness."
47,8,8,"I am not commanding you but testing the genuineness of your love by the enthusiasm of others."
47,8,9,"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Although he was rich, for your sakes he became poor, so that you, through his poverty, might become rich."
47,8,10,"I am giving you my opinion on this matter because it will be helpful to you. Last year you were not only willing to do something, but had already started to do it."
47,8,11,"Now finish doing it, so that your eagerness to undertake it may be matched by its completion, in keeping with what you have."
47,8,12,"For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you do not have."
47,8,13,"Not that others should have relief while you have hardship. Rather, it is a question of fairness."
47,8,14,"At the present time, your surplus fills their need, so that their surplus may fill your need. In this way things are fair."
47,8,15,"As it is written,	“The person who had much did not have too much,and the person who had little did not have too little.”"
47,8,16,"But thanks be to God, who placed in the heart of Titus the same dedication to you that I have."
47,8,17,"He welcomed my request and eagerly went to visit you by his own free will."
47,8,18,"With him we have sent the brother who is praised in all the churches for spreading the gospel."
47,8,19,"More than that, he has also been selected by the churches to travel with us while we are administering this work of kindness for the glory of the Lord and as evidence of our eagerness to help."
47,8,20,"We are trying to avoid any criticism of the way we are administering this great undertaking."
47,8,21,"We intend to do what is right, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of people."
47,8,22,"We have also sent with them our brother whom we have often tested in many ways and found to be dedicated. At present he is more dedicated than ever because he has so much confidence in you."
47,8,23,"As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker on your behalf. Our brothers, emissaries from the churches, are the glory of Christ."
47,8,24,"Therefore, give to the churches a demonstration of your love and a reason for why we boast about you."
47,9,1,"I do not need to write to you any further about the ministry to the saints."
47,9,2,"For I know how willing you are, and I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year, and your enthusiasm has stimulated most of them."
47,9,3,"Now I have sent the brothers so that our boasting about you in this matter may not prove to be an idle boast, and so that you may stand ready, just as I said."
47,9,4,"Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find out that you are not ready, we would be humiliated—to say nothing of you—in this undertaking."
47,9,5,"Therefore, I thought it necessary to urge these brothers to visit you ahead of me, to make arrangements in advance for this gift you promised, and to have it ready as something given generously and not forced."
47,9,6,"Remember this: The person who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the person who sows generously will also reap generously."
47,9,7,"Each of you must give what you have decided in your heart, not with regret or under compulsion, since God loves a cheerful giver."
47,9,8,"Besides, God is able to make every blessing of yours overflow for you, so that in every situation you will always have all you need for any good work."
47,9,9,"As it is written,	“He scatters everywhere and gives to the poor;his righteousness lasts forever.”"
47,9,10,"Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread to eat will also supply you with seed and multiply it and enlarge the harvest of your righteousness."
47,9,11,"In every way you will grow richer and become even more generous, and this will produce thanksgiving to God because of us."
47,9,12,"For this ministry you render is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, but it is also overflowing with more and more prayers of thanksgiving to God."
47,9,13,"Because of the proof that this service of yours brings, you will glorify God because of your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ and because of your generosity in sharing with them and everyone else."
47,9,14,"And so in their prayers for you they will long for you because of God's exceptional grace that was shown to you."
47,9,15,"Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!"
47,10,1,"Now I myself, Paul, plead with you with the gentleness and kindness of Christ—I who am humble when I am face to face with you but forceful toward you when I am away!"
47,10,2,"I beg you that when I come I will not need to be courageous by daring to oppose some people who think that we are living according to the flesh."
47,10,3,"Of course, we are living in the flesh, but we do not fight in a fleshly way."
47,10,4,"For the weapons of our warfare are not those of the flesh. Instead, they have the power of God to demolish fortresses. We tear down arguments"
47,10,5,"and every proud obstacle that is raised against the knowledge of God, taking every thought captive in order to obey Christ."
47,10,6,"We are ready to punish every act of disobedience when your obedience is complete."
47,10,7,"Look at the plain facts! If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself of this: Just as he belongs to Christ, so do we."
47,10,8,"So if I boast a little too much about our authority, which the Lord gave us to build you up and not to tear you down, I will not be ashamed of it."
47,10,9,"I do not want you to think that I am trying to frighten you with my letters."
47,10,10,"For someone is saying, “His letters are impressive and forceful, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible.”"
47,10,11,"Someone like this should take note of the following: What we say by letter when we are absent is what we will do when present!"
47,10,12,"We would not dare put ourselves in the same class with or compare ourselves to those who recommend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves to themselves, they show how foolish they are."
47,10,13,"We will not boast about what cannot be evaluated. Instead, we will stay within the field that God assigned us, so as to reach even you."
47,10,14,"For it is not as though we were overstepping our limits when we came to you. We were the first to reach you with the gospel of Christ."
47,10,15,"We are not boasting about the work done by others that cannot be evaluated. On the contrary, we cherish the hope that your faith may continue to grow and enlarge our sphere of action among you until it overflows."
47,10,16,"Then we can preach the gospel in the regions far beyond you without boasting about things already accomplished by someone else."
47,10,17,"“The person who boasts must boast in the Lord.”"
47,10,18,"It is not the person who commends himself who is approved, but the person whom the Lord commends."
47,11,1,"I wish you would put up with a little foolishness of mine. Yes, do put up with me!"
47,11,2,"I am jealous of you with God's own jealousy, because I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ."
47,11,3,"However, I am afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve by its tricks, so your minds may somehow be lured away from sincere and pure devotion to Christ."
47,11,4,"For if someone comes along and preaches another Jesus than the one we preached, or should you receive a different spirit from the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you are all too willing to listen."
47,11,5,"I do not think I'm inferior in any way to those “super-apostles.”"
47,11,6,"Even though I may be untrained as an orator, I am not so in the field of knowledge. We have made this clear to all of you in every possible way."
47,11,7,"Did I commit a sin when I humbled myself by proclaiming to you the gospel of God free of charge, so that you could be exalted?"
47,11,8,"I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you."
47,11,9,"When I was with you and needed something, I did not bother any of you, because our brothers who came from Macedonia supplied everything I needed. I kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and I will continue to do so."
47,11,10,"As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, my boasting will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia."
47,11,11,"Why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do!"
47,11,12,"But I will go on doing what I'm doing in order to deny an opportunity to those people who want an opportunity to be recognized as our equals in the work they are boasting about."
47,11,13,"Such people are false apostles, dishonest workers who are masquerading as apostles of Christ."
47,11,14,"And no wonder, since Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light."
47,11,15,"So it is not surprising if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their doom will match their deeds!"
47,11,16,"I will say it again: No one should think that I am a fool. But if you do, then treat me like a fool so that I can also boast a little."
47,11,17,"When I talk as a confident boaster, I am not talking with the Lord's authority but like a fool."
47,11,18,"Since many people boast in a fleshly way, I will do it, too."
47,11,19,"You are wise, so you will gladly put up with fools."
47,11,20,"You put up with anyone who makes you his slaves, devours what you have, takes what is yours, orders you around, or slaps your face!"
47,11,21,"I am ashamed to admit it, but we have been too weak for that. Whatever anyone else dares to claim—I am talking like a fool—I can claim it, too."
47,11,22,"Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I."
47,11,23,"Are they Christ's servants? I am insane to talk like this, but I am a far better one! I have been involved in far greater efforts, far more imprisonments, countless beatings, and have faced death more than once."
47,11,24,"Five times I received from the Jews forty lashes minus one."
47,11,25,"Three times I was beaten with a stick, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, and I drifted on the sea for a day and a night."
47,11,26,"I have been involved in frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the open country, dangers at sea, dangers from false brothers,"
47,11,27,"in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, through hunger and thirst, through many periods of fasting, through coldness and nakedness."
47,11,28,"Besides everything else, I have a daily burden because of my anxiety about all the churches."
47,11,29,"Who is weak without me being weak, too? Who is caused to stumble without me becoming indignant?"
47,11,30,"If I must boast, I will boast about the things that show how weak I am."
47,11,31,"The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying."
47,11,32,"In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas put guards around the city of Damascus to catch me,"
47,11,33,"but I was let down in a basket through an opening in the wall and escaped from his hands."
47,12,1,"I must boast, although it does not do any good. I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord."
47,12,2,"I know a man in Christ. Fourteen years ago—whether in his body or outside of his body, I do not know, but God knows—that man was snatched away to the third heaven."
47,12,3,"I know that this man—whether in his body or outside of his body, I do not know, but God knows—"
47,12,4,"was snatched away to Paradise and heard things that cannot be expressed in words, things that no human being has a right even to mention."
47,12,5,"I will boast about this man, but as for myself I will boast only about my weaknesses."
47,12,6,"However, if I did want to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be telling the truth. But I am not going to do it in order to keep anyone from thinking more of me than what he sees and hears about me."
47,12,7,"To keep me from becoming conceited because of the exceptional nature of these revelations, a thorn was given to me and placed in my body. It was Satan's messenger to keep on tormenting me so that I would not become conceited."
47,12,8,"I pleaded with the Lord three times to take it away from me,"
47,12,9,"but he has told me,"
47,12,10,"That is why I take such pleasure in weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and difficulties for Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then I am strong."
47,12,11,"I have become a fool. You forced me to be one. Really, I should have been commended by you, for I am not in any way inferior to your “super-apostles,” even if I am nothing."
47,12,12,"The signs of an apostle were performed among you with utmost patience—signs, wonders, and works of power."
47,12,13,"How were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I did not bother you for help? Forgive me for this wrong!"
47,12,14,"Here I am ready to visit you for a third time, and I will not bother you for help. I do not want your things but you. Children should not have to support their parents, but parents their children."
47,12,15,"I will be very glad to spend my money and myself for you. Do you love me less because I love you so much?"
47,12,16,"Granting that I have not been a burden to you, was I a clever schemer who trapped you by some trick?"
47,12,17,"I did not take advantage of you through any of the men I sent you, did I?"
47,12,18,"I encouraged Titus to visit you, and I sent along with him the brother you know so well. Titus didn't take advantage of you, did he? We conducted ourselves with the same spirit, didn't we? We took the very same steps, didn't we?"
47,12,19,"Have you been thinking all along that we are trying to defend ourselves before you? We are speaking before God in Christ, and everything, dear friends, is meant to build you up."
47,12,20,"I am afraid that I may come and somehow find you not as I want to find you, and that you may find me not as you want to find me. Perhaps there will be quarreling, jealousy, angry feelings, selfishness, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly conduct."
47,12,21,"I am afraid that when I come my God may again humble me before you and that I may have to grieve over many who formerly lived in sin and have not repented of their impurity, sexual immorality, and promiscuity that they once practiced."
47,13,1,"This will be the third time I am coming to you. “Every accusation must be verified by two or three witnesses.”"
47,13,2,"I have already warned those who sinned previously and all the rest. Although I am absent now, I am warning them as I did on my second visit: If I come back, I will not spare you,"
47,13,3,"since you want proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you but is making his power felt among you."
47,13,4,"Though he was crucified in weakness, he lives by God's power. We are weak with him, but by God's power we will live for you."
47,13,5,"Keep examining yourselves to see whether you are continuing in the faith. Test yourselves! You know, do not you, that Jesus Christ lives in you? Could it be that you are failing the test?"
47,13,6,"I hope you will realize that we haven't failed our test."
47,13,7,"We pray to God that you will not do anything wrong—not to show that we have not failed the test, but so that you may do what is right, even if we seem to have failed."
47,13,8,"For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth."
47,13,9,"We are glad when we are weak and you are strong. That is what we are praying for—your maturity."
47,13,10,"For this reason I am writing this while I am away from you: When I come I do not want to be severe in using the authority the Lord gave me to build you up and not to tear you down."
47,13,11,"Finally, brothers, goodbye. Keep on growing to maturity. Keep listening to my appeals. Continue agreeing with each other and living in peace. Then the God of love and peace will be with you."
47,13,12,"Greet one another with a holy kiss."
47,13,13,"All the saints greet you."
47,13,14,"May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you!"
48,1,1,"From Paul—an apostle not sent from men or by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead—"
48,1,2,"and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches in Galatia."
48,1,3,"May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!"
48,1,4,"He gave himself for our sins in order to rescue us from this present evil age according to the will of our God and Father."
48,1,5,"To him be the glory forever and ever! Amen."
48,1,6,"I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ to follow a different gospel,"
48,1,7,"which is not really another one. To be sure, there are certain people who are troubling you and want to distort the gospel about Christ."
48,1,8,"But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let that person be condemned!"
48,1,9,"What we have told you in the past I am now telling you again: If anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let that person be condemned!"
48,1,10,"Am I now trying to win the approval of people or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be Christ's servant."
48,1,11,"For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin."
48,1,12,"For I did not receive it from a man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ."
48,1,13,"For you have heard about my earlier life in Judaism—how I kept violently persecuting God's church and was trying to destroy it."
48,1,14,"I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries, because I was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors."
48,1,15,"But when God, who set me apart before I was born and who called me by his grace, was pleased"
48,1,16,"to reveal his Son to me so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with another human being at any time,"
48,1,17,"nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me. Instead, I went away to Arabia and then came back to Damascus."
48,1,18,"Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and I stayed with him for fifteen days."
48,1,19,"But I did not see any other apostle except James, the Lord's brother."
48,1,20,"(I declare before God that what I am writing to you is not a lie.)"
48,1,21,"Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia."
48,1,22,"But I was unknown by sight to the churches of Christ in Judea."
48,1,23,"The only thing they kept hearing was this: “The man who used to persecute us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy!”"
48,1,24,"So they kept glorifying God for what had happened to me."
48,2,1,"Then fourteen years later I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me."
48,2,2,"I went in response to a revelation, and in a private meeting with the reputed leaders I set before them the gospel I proclaim among the Gentiles. I did this because I was afraid that I was running or had run for nothing."
48,2,3,"But not even Titus, who was with me, was forced to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek."
48,2,4,"However, false brothers were secretly brought in. They slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus so that they might enslave us."
48,2,5,"But we did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you."
48,2,6,"Now those who were reputed to be important added nothing to my message. (What sort of people they were makes no difference to me, since God pays no attention to outward appearances.)"
48,2,7,"In fact, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised."
48,2,8,"For the one who worked through Peter by making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me by sending me to the Gentiles."
48,2,9,"So when James, Cephas, and John (who were reputed to be leaders) recognized the grace that had been given me, they gave Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised."
48,2,10,"The only thing they asked us to do was to remember the destitute, the very thing I was eager to do."
48,2,11,"But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly wrong."
48,2,12,"For until some men came from James, he was in the habit of eating with the Gentiles, but after they came he drew back and would not associate himself with them, being afraid of the circumcision party."
48,2,13,"The other Jews also joined him in this hypocrisy, to the extent that even Barnabas was caught up in their hypocrisy."
48,2,14,"But when I saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel, I told Cephas in front of everyone, “Though you are a Jew, you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. So how can you insist that the Gentiles must live like Jews?”"
48,2,15,"We ourselves are Jews by birth, and not Gentile sinners,"
48,2,16,"yet we know that a person is not justified by the works of the law but by the faithfulness of Jesus Christ. We, too, have believed in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law, for no human being will be justified by the works of the law."
48,2,17,"Now if we, while trying to be justified in Christ, have been found to be sinners, does that mean that Christ is a minister of sin? Of course not!"
48,2,18,"For if I rebuild something that I tore down, I demonstrate that I am a wrongdoer."
48,2,19,"For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ."
48,2,20,"I no longer live, but Christ lives in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faithfulness of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
48,2,21,"I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing."
48,3,1,"You foolish Galatians! Who put you under a spell? Was not Jesus Christ clearly portrayed as crucified before your very eyes?"
48,3,2,"I want to learn only one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard?"
48,3,3,"Are you so foolish? Having started out with the Spirit, are you now ending up with the flesh?"
48,3,4,"Did you suffer so much for nothing? (If it really was for nothing!)"
48,3,5,"Does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you because you do the works of the law or because you believe what you heard?"
48,3,6,"In the same way, Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”"
48,3,7,"You see, then, that those who have faith are Abraham's real descendants."
48,3,8,"Because the Scripture saw ahead of time that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, it announced the gospel to Abraham beforehand when it said, “Through you all nations will be blessed.”"
48,3,9,"Therefore, those who believe are blessed together with Abraham, the one who believed."
48,3,10,"Certainly all who depend on the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, “A curse on everyone who does not obey everything that is written in the book of the law!”"
48,3,11,"Now it is obvious that no one is justified in the sight of God by the law, because “The righteous will live by faith.”"
48,3,12,"But the law has nothing to do with faith. Instead, “The person who keeps the commandments will have life in them.”"
48,3,13,"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written, “A curse on everyone who is hung on a tree!”"
48,3,14,"This happened in order that the blessing promised to Abraham would come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith."
48,3,15,"Brothers, let me use an example from everyday life. Once a person's will has been ratified, no one can cancel it or add conditions to it."
48,3,16,"Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. It doesn't say “descendants,” referring to many, but “your descendant,” referring to one person, who is Christ."
48,3,17,"This is what I mean: The law that came 430 years later did not cancel the covenant previously ratified by God so as to nullify the promise."
48,3,18,"For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by the promise. But it was by a promise that God so graciously gave it to Abraham."
48,3,19,"Why, then, was the law given? It was added because of transgressions until the descendant came to whom the promise was given. It was put into effect through angels by means of an intermediary."
48,3,20,"Now an intermediary involves more than one party, but God has acted on his own."
48,3,21,"So is the law in conflict with the promises of God? Of course not! For if a law had been given that could give us life, then certainly righteousness would come through the law."
48,3,22,"But the Scripture has put everything under the power of sin, so that what was promised by the faithfulness of Christ might be given to those who believe."
48,3,23,"Now before this faith came, we were held in custody and carefully guarded under the law in preparation for the faith that was to be revealed."
48,3,24,"And so the law was our guardian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith."
48,3,25,"But now that this faith has come, we are no longer under the control of a guardian."
48,3,26,"For all of you are God's children through faith in Christ Jesus."
48,3,27,"Indeed, all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ."
48,3,28,"A person is no longer a Jew or a Greek, a slave or a free person, a male or a female, because all of you are one in Christ Jesus."
48,3,29,"And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants and heirs according to the promise."
48,4,1,"Now what I am saying is this: As long as an heir is a child, he is no better off than a slave, even though he owns everything."
48,4,2,"Instead, he is placed under the control of guardians and trustees until the time set by the father."
48,4,3,"It was the same way with us. While we were children, we were slaves to the basic principles of the world."
48,4,4,"But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,"
48,4,5,"in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as his children."
48,4,6,"Now because you are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts to cry out, “Abba! Father!”"
48,4,7,"So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if you are a child, then you are also an heir through God."
48,4,8,"However, in the past, when you did not know God, you were slaves to things that are not really gods at all."
48,4,9,"But now that you know God, or rather have been known by God, how can you turn back again to those powerless and bankrupt basic principles? Why do you want to become their slaves all over again?"
48,4,10,"You are observing days, months, seasons, and years."
48,4,11,"I am afraid for you, lest somehow my work for you has been wasted!"
48,4,12,"I beg you, brothers, to become like me, since I became like you. You did not do anything wrong to me."
48,4,13,"You know that it was because I was ill that I brought you the gospel the first time."
48,4,14,"Even though my condition put you to the test, you did not despise or reject me. On the contrary, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as Christ Jesus himself."
48,4,15,"What, then, happened to your positive attitude? For I testify that if it had been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me."
48,4,16,"So have I now become your enemy for telling you the truth?"
48,4,17,"These people are devoted to you, but not in a good way. They want you to avoid me so that you will be devoted to them."
48,4,18,"(Now it is always good to be devoted to a good cause, even when I am not with you.)"
48,4,19,"My children, I am suffering birth pains for you again until Christ is formed in you."
48,4,20,"Indeed, I wish I were with you right now so that I could change the tone of my voice, because I am completely baffled by you!"
48,4,21,"Tell me, those of you who want to live under the law: Are you really listening to what the law says?"
48,4,22,"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman."
48,4,23,"Now the son of the slave woman was conceived according to the flesh, but the son of the free woman was conceived through a promise."
48,4,24,"This is being said as an allegory, for these women represent two covenants. The one woman, Hagar, is from Mount Sinai, and her children are born into slavery."
48,4,25,"Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to present-day Jerusalem, because she is in slavery along with her children."
48,4,26,"But the heavenly Jerusalem is the free woman, and she is our mother."
48,4,27,"For it is written,	“Rejoice, you childless woman,who cannot give birth to any children!	Break into song and shout,you who feel no pains of childbirth!	For the children of the deserted womanare more numerous than the childrenof the woman who has a husband.”"
48,4,28,"So you, brothers, are children of the promise, like Isaac."
48,4,29,"But just as then the son who was conceived according to the flesh persecuted the son who was conceived according to the Spirit, so it is now."
48,4,30,"But what does the Scripture say? “Drive out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman must never share the inheritance with the son of the free woman.”"
48,4,31,"So then, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman."
48,5,1,"Christ has set us free so that we may enjoy the benefits of freedom. So keep on standing firm in it, and stop attaching yourselves to the yoke of slavery again."
48,5,2,"Listen! I, Paul, am telling you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you."
48,5,3,"Again, I insist that everyone who allows himself to be circumcised is obligated to obey the entire law."
48,5,4,"Those of you who are trying to be justified by the law have been cut off from Christ. You have fallen away from grace."
48,5,5,"For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness."
48,5,6,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters. What matters is faith that is active through love."
48,5,7,"You were running beautifully! Who cut in on you and stopped you from obeying the truth?"
48,5,8,"Such influence does not come from the one who calls you."
48,5,9,"A little yeast spreads through the whole batch of dough."
48,5,10,"I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view of the matter. However, the one who is troubling you will suffer God's judgment, whoever he is."
48,5,11,"As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching the necessity of circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed."
48,5,12,"I wish that those who are unsettling you would castrate themselves!"
48,5,13,"For you, brothers, were called to freedom. Only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity to gratify your flesh, but through love make it your habit to serve one another."
48,5,14,"For the whole law is summarized in a single statement: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”"
48,5,15,"But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you are not destroyed by each other."
48,5,16,"So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will never fulfill the desires of the flesh."
48,5,17,"For what the flesh wants is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit wants is opposed to the flesh. They are opposed to each other, and so you do not do what you want to do."
48,5,18,"But if you are being led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."
48,5,19,"Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, promiscuity,"
48,5,20,"idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, rivalry, jealously, outbursts of anger, quarrels, conflicts, factions,"
48,5,21,"envy, murder, drunkenness, wild partying, and things like that. I am telling you now, as I have told you in the past, that people who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."
48,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,"
48,5,23,"gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things."
48,5,24,"Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their flesh with its passions and desires."
48,5,25,"If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit."
48,5,26,"Let us stop being arrogant, provoking one another and envying one another."
48,6,1,"Brothers, if a person is caught doing something wrong, those of you who are spiritual should restore that person in a spirit of gentleness. Watch out for yourself so that you are not tempted as well."
48,6,2,"Practice carrying each other's burdens. In this way you will fulfill the law of Christ."
48,6,3,"For if anyone thinks he is something when he is really nothing, he is only fooling himself."
48,6,4,"Each person must approve his own actions, and then he can boast about his own accomplishments and not those of his neighbor."
48,6,5,"For everyone must carry his own load."
48,6,6,"The person who is taught the word should share all his goods with his teacher."
48,6,7,"Stop being deceived; God is not to be ridiculed. A person harvests whatever he plants."
48,6,8,"For the person who plants in his flesh will harvest decay from the flesh, but the person who plants in the Spirit will harvest eternal life from the Spirit."
48,6,9,"Let us not get tired of doing what is good, for at the right time we will reap a harvest—if we do not give up."
48,6,10,"So then, whenever we have the opportunity, let us practice doing good to everyone, especially to the family of faith."
48,6,11,"Look at how large these letters are because I am writing with my own hand!"
48,6,12,"These people who want to impress others by their flesh are trying to force you to be circumcised, simply to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ."
48,6,13,"Why, not even those who are circumcised obey the law! They simply want you to be circumcised so that they can boast about your flesh."
48,6,14,"But may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world!"
48,6,15,"For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters. Rather, what matters is being a new creation."
48,6,16,"Now may peace be on all those who live by this principle, and may mercy be on the Israel of God."
48,6,17,"From now on let no one make trouble for me, for I carry the scars of Jesus on my own body."
48,6,18,"May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers! Amen."
49,1,1,"From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will, to his holy and faithful people in Ephesus who are in union with Christ Jesus."
49,1,2,"May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!"
49,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realm,"
49,1,4,"just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in his presence. In love"
49,1,5,"he predestined us for adoption to himself through Jesus Christ, according to the pleasure of his will,"
49,1,6,"so that we would praise his glorious grace that he gave us in the Beloved One."
49,1,7,"In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our offenses, according to the riches of God's grace"
49,1,8,"that he lavished on us, along with all wisdom and understanding,"
49,1,9,"when he made known to us the secret of his will. This was according to his plan that he set forth in Christ"
49,1,10,"to usher in the fullness of the times and to gather up all things in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth."
49,1,11,"In Christ we were also chosen when we were predestined according to the purpose of the one who does everything according to the intention of his will,"
49,1,12,"so that we who had already fixed our hope on Christ might live for his praise and glory."
49,1,13,"You, too, have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed in him you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,"
49,1,14,"who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of God's own possession, to his praise and glory."
49,1,15,"Therefore, because I have heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,"
49,1,16,"I never stop giving thanks for you as I mention you in my prayers."
49,1,17,"I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father most glorious, would give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation through knowing Christ fully."
49,1,18,"Then, with the eyes of your hearts enlightened, you will know the hope of his calling, the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints,"
49,1,19,"and the unlimited greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his mighty strength,"
49,1,20,"which he put to work in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realm."
49,1,21,"He is far above every ruler, authority, power, dominion, and every name that can be named, not only in the present age but also in the one to come."
49,1,22,"God has put everything under his feet and has made him the head of everything for the good of the church,"
49,1,23,"which is his body, the fullness of the one who fills everything in every way."
49,2,1,"You used to be dead because of your offenses and sins,"
49,2,2,"in which you once lived according to the ways of this present world and according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now active in those who are disobedient."
49,2,3,"Indeed, all of us once behaved like them in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of our flesh and senses. By nature we deserved wrath, just like everyone else."
49,2,4,"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love for us"
49,2,5,"even when we were dead because of our offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),"
49,2,6,"raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly realm in Christ Jesus,"
49,2,7,"so that in the coming ages he might display the limitless riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus."
49,2,8,"For by such grace you have been saved through faith. This does not come from you; it is the gift of God"
49,2,9,"and not the result of works, lest anyone boast."
49,2,10,"For we are his masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared long ago to be our way of life."
49,2,11,"So then, remember that at one time you were Gentiles by birth and were called “the uncircumcision” by what is called “the circumcision” made in the flesh by hands."
49,2,12,"At that time you were without Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise. You had no hope and were in the world without God."
49,2,13,"But now, in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ."
49,2,14,"For it is he who is our peace. In his flesh he made both groups one by tearing down the wall of hostility that divided them."
49,2,15,"He rendered the law inoperative, along with its commandments and regulations, so that he might create in himself one new humanity from the two, thus making peace,"
49,2,16,"and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, on which he killed the hostility."
49,2,17,"He came and proclaimed peace for you who were far away and for you who were near."
49,2,18,"For through him, both of us have access to the Father in one Spirit."
49,2,19,"That is why you are no longer strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and members of God's household,"
49,2,20,"having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone."
49,2,21,"In him the whole building is joined together and rises into a holy sanctuary in the Lord."
49,2,22,"You, too, are being built in him along with the others into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit."
49,3,1,"For this reason I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles."
49,3,2,"Surely you have heard about the responsibility of administering God's grace that was given to me on your behalf,"
49,3,3,"and how this secret was made known to me through a revelation, just as I wrote about briefly in the past."
49,3,4,"By reading this, you will be able to grasp my understanding of the secret about Christ,"
49,3,5,"which in previous generations was not made known to human beings as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets:"
49,3,6,"The Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow sharers of what was promised in Christ Jesus through the gospel."
49,3,7,"I have become a servant of this gospel according to the gift of God's grace that was given me by the working of his power."
49,3,8,"To me, the very least of all the saints, this grace was given so that I might proclaim to the Gentiles the immeasurable wealth of Christ"
49,3,9,"and help everyone see how this secret, which was hidden for ages in God who created all things, has been at work."
49,3,10,"He did this so that now, through the church, the wisdom of God in all its variety might be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realm"
49,3,11,"in keeping with the eternal purpose that God carried out through Christ Jesus our Lord,"
49,3,12,"in whom we have boldness and confident access through his faithfulness."
49,3,13,"So then, I ask you not to become discouraged because of my troubles on your behalf, which are your glory."
49,3,14,"This is the reason I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
49,3,15,"from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its name."
49,3,16,"I pray that he would give you, according to his glorious riches, strength in your inner being and power through his Spirit,"
49,3,17,"and that Christ would make his home in your hearts through faith. Then, having been rooted and grounded in love,"
49,3,18,"you will be able to understand, along with all the saints, what is wide, long, high, and deep—"
49,3,19,"that is, you will know the love of Christ, which goes far beyond knowledge, and will be filled with all the fullness of God."
49,3,20,"Now to the one who can do infinitely more than all we can ask or imagine according to the power that is working among us—"
49,3,21,"to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever! Amen."
49,4,1,"I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, urge you to live in a way that is worthy of the calling to which you have been called,"
49,4,2,"with all humility and gentleness, along with patience, accepting one another in love."
49,4,3,"Do your best to maintain the unity of the Spirit by means of the bond of peace."
49,4,4,"There is one body and one Spirit. In the same way, you were called to the one hope of your calling."
49,4,5,"There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
49,4,6,"one God and Father of all, who is above all, through all, and in all."
49,4,7,"Now to each one of us grace has been given according to the measure of Christ's gift."
49,4,8,"That is why God says,	“When he went up to the highest placehe led captives into captivityand gave gifts to people.”"
49,4,9,"Now what does this “he went up” mean except that he also had gone down into the lower parts of the earth?"
49,4,10,"The one who went down is the same one who went up above all the heavens so that he might fill everything."
49,4,11,"And it is he who gifted some to be apostles, others to be prophets, others to be evangelists, and still others to be pastors and teachers,"
49,4,12,"to perfect the saints, to do the work of ministry, and to build up the body of Christ"
49,4,13,"until all of us are united in the faith and in the full knowledge of God's Son, and until we attain mature adulthood and the full standard of development in Christ."
49,4,14,"Then we will no longer be little children, tossed like waves and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people's trickery, or by clever strategies that would lead us astray."
49,4,15,"Instead, by speaking the truth in love, we will grow up completely into the one who is the head, that is, into Christ,"
49,4,16,"in whom the whole body is united and held together by every ligament with which it is supplied. As each individual part does its job, the body's growth is promoted so that it builds itself up in love."
49,4,17,"Therefore, I tell you and insist on in the Lord not to live any longer like the Gentiles live, thinking worthless thoughts."
49,4,18,"They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of their ignorance and hardness of heart."
49,4,19,"Since they have lost all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to sensuality and practice every kind of sexual perversion without restraint."
49,4,20,"However, that is not the way you came to know Christ."
49,4,21,"Surely you have listened to him and have been taught by him, since truth is in Jesus."
49,4,22,"Regarding your former way of life, you were taught to strip off your old man, which is being ruined by its deceptive desires,"
49,4,23,"to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,"
49,4,24,"and to clothe yourselves with the new man, which was created according to the likeness of God in righteousness and true holiness."
49,4,25,"Therefore, stripping off falsehood, “let each of us speak the truth to his neighbor,” for we are members of one another."
49,4,26,"“Be angry, yet do not sin.” Do not let the sun go down on your wrath,"
49,4,27,"and do not give the devil an opportunity to work."
49,4,28,"The thief must no longer steal but must work hard and do what is good with his own hands, so that he might have something to give to the needy."
49,4,29,"Let no filthy talk come out of your mouths, but only what is good for building up as the need may be. This way you will give grace to those who hear you."
49,4,30,"Do not grieve the Holy Spirit, by whom you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption."
49,4,31,"Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, quarreling, and slander be put away from you, along with all hatred."
49,4,32,"And be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another just as God has forgiven you in Christ."
49,5,1,"So be imitators of God, as his dear children."
49,5,2,"Live in love as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us as an offering and sacrifice, a fragrant aroma to God."
49,5,3,"Do not let sexual sin, impurity of any kind, or greed even be mentioned among you, as is proper for saints."
49,5,4,"Obscene, flippant, or vulgar talk is totally inappropriate. Instead, let there be thanksgiving."
49,5,5,"For you know very well that no immoral or impure person, or anyone who is greedy (that is, an idolater), has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
49,5,6,"Do not let anyone deceive you with meaningless words, for it is because of these things that God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient."
49,5,7,"So do not be partners with them."
49,5,8,"For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light."
49,5,9,"For the fruit of the light consists of every form of goodness, righteousness, and truth."
49,5,10,"Determine what pleases the Lord,"
49,5,11,"and have nothing to do with the unfruitful works of darkness. Instead, expose them for what they are."
49,5,12,"For it is shameful even to mention what is done by people in secret."
49,5,13,"But everything that is exposed to the light becomes visible,"
49,5,14,"for everything that is visible is light. That is why it says,	“Wake up, O sleeper!Arise from the dead,And Christ will shine on you.’’"
49,5,15,"So, then, be careful how you live. Do not be unwise but wise,"
49,5,16,"making the best use of time because the days are evil."
49,5,17,"Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is."
49,5,18,"Stop getting drunk with wine, which leads to wild living, but keep on being filled with the Spirit."
49,5,19,"Then you will recite to one another psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. You will sing and make music to the Lord with your hearts."
49,5,20,"You will always give thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
49,5,21,"And you will submit yourselves to one another out of reverence for Christ."
49,5,22,"Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as to the Lord."
49,5,23,"For the husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. It is he who is the Savior of the body."
49,5,24,"Indeed, just as the church is submissive to Christ, so wives must be submissive to their husbands in everything."
49,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it,"
49,5,26,"so that he might make it holy by cleansing it, washing it with water and the word,"
49,5,27,"and might present the church to himself in all its glory, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind, but holy and without fault."
49,5,28,"In the same way, husbands must love their wives as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself."
49,5,29,"For no one has ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, as Christ does the church."
49,5,30,"For we are parts of his body—of his flesh and of his bones."
49,5,31,"“That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”"
49,5,32,"This is a great secret, but I am talking about Christ and the church."
49,5,33,"But each individual man among you must love his wife as he loves himself; and may the wife fear her husband."
49,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is the right thing to do."
49,6,2,"“Honor your father and mother.” This is a very important commandment with a promise:"
49,6,3,"“So that it may go well for you, and that you may have a long life on the earth.”"
49,6,4,"Fathers, do not make your children angry, but bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord."
49,6,5,"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear, with trembling, and along with sincerity, as when you obey Christ."
49,6,6,"Do not do this only while being watched in order to please them, but be like slaves of Christ who do God's will from the heart."
49,6,7,"Serve willingly, as if you were serving the Lord and not merely people."
49,6,8,"For you know that everyone will receive a reward from the Lord for whatever good he has done, whether he is a slave or free."
49,6,9,"Masters, treat your slaves the same way. Do not threaten them, for you know that both of you have the same Master in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him."
49,6,10,"Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty strength."
49,6,11,"Put on the whole armor of God so that you may be able to stand firm against the devil's strategies."
49,6,12,"For our struggle is not against a human opponent, but against rulers, against authorities, against cosmic powers in the darkness around us, against evil spiritual forces in the heavenly realm."
49,6,13,"For this reason, take up the whole armor of God so that you may be able to take a stand in that evil day. And when you have done everything you could, you will be able to stand firm."
49,6,14,"Stand firm, therefore, having fastened the belt of truth around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,"
49,6,15,"and having put shoes on your feet so that you are ready to proclaim the gospel of peace."
49,6,16,"In addition to all of these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to put out all the flaming arrows of the evil one,"
49,6,17,"also take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."
49,6,18,"Pray in the Spirit at all times with every kind of prayer and request there is. For the same reason be alert with every kind of effort and request for all the saints."
49,6,19,"Pray also for me, so that, when I open my mouth, the right words will be given to me. Then I will boldly make known the secret of the gospel,"
49,6,20,"for whose sake I am an ambassador in chains, desiring to declare it as boldly as I should."
49,6,21,"So that you may know what has happened to me and how I am doing, Tychicus, our dear brother and a faithful minister in the Lord, will tell you everything."
49,6,22,"I am sending him to you for this very reason, so that you may know how we are doing and that he may encourage your hearts."
49,6,23,"May the brothers have peace and love, with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!"
49,6,24,"May grace be with all who love the Lord Jesus Christ with sincerity!"
50,1,1,"From Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the holy ones in Philippi who are united with Christ Jesus, with their overseers and deacons."
50,1,2,"May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!"
50,1,3,"I thank my God every time I remember you,"
50,1,4,"always praying with joy in every one of my prayers for all of you"
50,1,5,"because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now."
50,1,6,"I am convinced of this, that the one who began a good work among you will bring it to completion by the day of Christ Jesus."
50,1,7,"For it is only right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart. Both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, all of you are partners with me in grace."
50,1,8,"For God is my witness how much I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus."
50,1,9,"And this is my prayer, that your love will keep on growing more and more in full knowledge and perfect insight,"
50,1,10,"so that you may be able to determine what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,"
50,1,11,"having been filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God."
50,1,12,"Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually turned out for the progress of the gospel."
50,1,13,"As a result, it has become clear to the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that I am in prison because of Christ."
50,1,14,"Moreover, because of my imprisonment most of the brothers have been made confident in the Lord to speak God's word more boldly and courageously than ever before."
50,1,15,"Some are preaching Christ because of their envy and rivalry, while others do so because of their good will."
50,1,16,"The latter are motivated by love, because they know that I have been appointed for the defense of the gospel."
50,1,17,"The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition and without sincerity, thinking that they will stir up trouble for me during my imprisonment."
50,1,18,"But what does it matter? Just this, that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and because of this I rejoice. Yes, I will continue to rejoice,"
50,1,19,"because I know that this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the help that comes from the Spirit of Jesus Christ."
50,1,20,"This is according to my eager expectation and hope that I will have nothing to be ashamed of. Instead, because of my boldness Christ will be exalted in my body, now as always, whether I live or die."
50,1,21,"For to me, to go on living is Christ, and to die is gain."
50,1,22,"Now if I go on living in this body, that will produce more results, yet I do not know which I would prefer."
50,1,23,"Indeed, I cannot decide between the two. I have the desire to leave this life and be with Christ, for that is far better."
50,1,24,"But for your sake it is better that I remain in this body."
50,1,25,"Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will continue to live and be with all of you for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith."
50,1,26,"Then your boasting in Christ Jesus will increase along with mine through my coming again to you."
50,1,27,"The only thing that matters is that you continue to live as good citizens in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come to see you or whether I stay away, I may hear all about you—that you are standing firm in one spirit, struggling with one mind for the faith of the gospel,"
50,1,28,"and that you are not intimidated by your opponents in any way. This is evidence that they will be destroyed and that you will be saved—and all because of God."
50,1,29,"For you have been given the privilege for Christ's sake not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him."
50,1,30,"You have the same struggle that you saw in me and now hear that I am still having."
50,2,1,"Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any comfort of love, if there is any fellowship in the Spirit, if there is any compassion and sympathy,"
50,2,2,"then fill me with joy by having the same attitude, sharing the same love, being united in spirit, and keeping one purpose in mind."
50,2,3,"Do not act out of selfish ambition or conceit, but with humility think of others as being better than yourselves."
50,2,4,"Do not be concerned about your own interests, but also be concerned about the interests of others."
50,2,5,"Have the same attitude among yourselves that was also in Christ Jesus:"
50,2,6,"In God's own form existed he,And shared with God equality,Deemed nothing needed grasping."
50,2,7,"Instead, poured out in emptiness,A servant's form did he possess,A mortal man becoming.	In human form he chose to be,"
50,2,8,"And lived in all humility,Death on a cross obeying."
50,2,9,"Now lifted up by God to heaven,A name above all others given,This matchless name possessing."
50,2,10,"And so, when Jesus’ name is called,The knees of everyone should fallWhere'er they are residing."
50,2,11,"Then every tongue in one accord,Will say that Jesus Christ is Lord,While God the Father praising."
50,2,12,"And so, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only when I was with you but even more now that I am absent, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
50,2,13,"For it is God who is producing in you both the desire and the ability to do what pleases him."
50,2,14,"Do everything without complaining or arguing"
50,2,15,"so that you may be blameless and innocent, God's children without any faults among a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine like stars in the world"
50,2,16,"as you hold out the word of life. Then I can boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or work hard in vain."
50,2,17,"Yet even if I am being poured out like an offering as part of the sacrifice and service I offer for your faith, I rejoice, and I share my joy with all of you."
50,2,18,"In the same way, you also should rejoice and share your joy with me."
50,2,19,"Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon so that I can be encouraged when I learn of your condition."
50,2,20,"I do not have anyone else like him who takes a genuine interest in your welfare."
50,2,21,"For all the others look after their own interests, not after those of Jesus Christ."
50,2,22,"But you know his proven worth—how like a son with his father he served with me in the gospel."
50,2,23,"Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things are going to turn out for me."
50,2,24,"Indeed, I am confident in the Lord that I will come to visit you soon."
50,2,25,"Meanwhile, I thought it best to send Epaphroditus—my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need—back to you."
50,2,26,"For he has been longing for all of you and is troubled because you heard that he was sick."
50,2,27,"Indeed, he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have one sorrow on top of another."
50,2,28,"Therefore, I am especially eager to send him so that you may have the joy of seeing him again, and so that I may feel relieved."
50,2,29,"So welcome him in the Lord with all joy, and make sure you honor such people highly."
50,2,30,"For he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me."
50,3,1,"So then, my brothers, keep on rejoicing in the Lord. It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you; indeed, it is for your safety."
50,3,2,"Beware of the dogs! Beware of the evil workers! Beware of the mutilators!"
50,3,3,"For it is we who are the circumcision—we who worship in the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus. We have not placed any confidence in the flesh,"
50,3,4,"although I could have confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he can place confidence in the flesh, I have more reason to think so."
50,3,5,"Having been circumcised on the eighth day, I am of the nation of Israel, from the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews. As far as the law is concerned, I was a Pharisee."
50,3,6,"As far as zeal is concerned, I was a persecutor of the church. As far as the righteousness that is in the law is concerned, I was perfect."
50,3,7,"But whatever things were assets to me, these I now consider a loss for the sake of Christ."
50,3,8,"What is more, I continue to consider all these things as a loss for the sake of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. It is because of him that I have experienced the loss of all those things. Indeed, I consider them rubbish in order to gain Christ"
50,3,9,"and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through the faithfulness of Christ, the righteousness that comes from God and that depends on faith."
50,3,10,"I want to know Christ—what his resurrection power is like and what it means to share in his sufferings by becoming like him in his death,"
50,3,11,"though I hope to experience the resurrection from the dead."
50,3,12,"It's not that I have already reached this goal or have already become perfect. But I keep pursuing it, hoping somehow to embrace it just as I have been embraced by Christ Jesus."
50,3,13,"Brothers, I do not consider myself to have embraced it. But this one thing I do: Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,"
50,3,14,"I keep pursuing the goal to win the prize of God's heavenly call in Christ Jesus."
50,3,15,"Therefore, those of us who are mature should think this way. And if you think differently about anything, God will show you how to think."
50,3,16,"However, we should live up to what we have achieved so far."
50,3,17,"Join together in imitating me, brothers, and pay close attention to those who live by the example we have given you."
50,3,18,"For I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears, that many live as enemies of the cross of Christ."
50,3,19,"Their destiny is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on worldly things."
50,3,20,"Our citizenship, however, is in heaven, and it is from there that we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ."
50,3,21,"He will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorious body through the power that enables him to bring everything under his authority."
50,4,1,"Therefore, my dear brothers whom I long for, my joy and my victor's crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends."
50,4,2,"I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to have the same attitude in the Lord."
50,4,3,"Yes, I also ask you, my true partner, to help these women. They have struggled with me in the gospel along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life."
50,4,4,"Keep on rejoicing in the Lord at all times. I will say it again: Keep on rejoicing!"
50,4,5,"Let your forbearing spirit be known to all people.The Lord is near:"
50,4,6,"Never worry about anything, but in every situation let your petitions be made known to God in prayers and requests, with thanksgiving."
50,4,7,"Then God's peace, which goes far beyond anything we can imagine, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus."
50,4,8,"Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is fair, whatever is pure, whatever is acceptable, whatever is commendable, if there is anything of excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy—keep thinking about these things."
50,4,9,"Likewise, keep practicing these things: what you have learned, received, heard, and seen in me. Then the God of peace will be with you."
50,4,10,"Now I rejoice in the Lord greatly, because once again you have shown your concern for me. Of course, you were concerned for me but you did not have an opportunity to show it."
50,4,11,"I am not saying this because I am in any need, for I have learned to be content in whatever situation I am in."
50,4,12,"I know how to be humble, and I know how to prosper. In each and every situation I have learned the secret of being full and of going hungry, of having too much and of having too little."
50,4,13,"I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
50,4,14,"Nevertheless, it was kind of you to share my troubles."
50,4,15,"You Philippians also know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church participated with me in the matter of giving and receiving except for you."
50,4,16,"Even while I was in Thessalonica, you provided for my needs not once, but twice."
50,4,17,"It is not that I am looking for a gift. No, I am looking for the profit that accumulates to your account."
50,4,18,"I have been paid in full and have more than enough. I am fully supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus what you sent—a fragrant aroma, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God."
50,4,19,"And my God will fully supply your every need according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus."
50,4,20,"Glory belongs to our God and Father forever and ever! Amen."
50,4,21,"Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send their greetings to you."
50,4,22,"All the saints, especially those of the emperor's household, greet you."
50,4,23,"May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit! Amen."
51,1,1,"From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,"
51,1,2,"to the holy and faithful brothers in Colossae who are in union with Christ.May grace and peace from God our Father be yours!"
51,1,3,"We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
51,1,4,"because we have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have for all the saints,"
51,1,5,"based on the hope laid up for you in heaven. Some time ago you heard about this hope in the word of truth, the gospel"
51,1,6,"that has come to you. Just as it is bearing fruit and spreading all over the world, so it has been doing among you from the day you heard it and came to know the grace of God in truth."
51,1,7,"You learned about this gospel from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf."
51,1,8,"He has told us about your love in the Spirit."
51,1,9,"For this reason, since the day we heard about this, we have not stopped praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the full knowledge of God's will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,"
51,1,10,"so that you might live in a manner worthy of the Lord and be fully pleasing to him as you bear fruit in every good work and grow in the full knowledge of God."
51,1,11,"You are being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might, so that you might patiently endure everything with joy"
51,1,12,"and might thank the Father, who has enabled us to share in the saints’ inheritance in the light."
51,1,13,"He has rescued us from the power of darkness and has brought us into the kingdom of the Son whom he loves."
51,1,14,"In him we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."
51,1,15,"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation."
51,1,16,"For by him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether they are kings, lords, rulers, or powers. All things have been created through him and for him."
51,1,17,"He himself existed before all things, and by him all things hold together."
51,1,18,"He is also the head of the body, which is the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he himself might have first place in everything."
51,1,19,"For God was pleased to have all of his fullness live in him."
51,1,20,"Through him he also reconciled all things to himself, whether things on earth or things in heaven, thus making peace through the blood of his cross."
51,1,21,"You who were once alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,"
51,1,22,"he has now reconciled by the death of his physical body so that he might present you holy, blameless, and without fault before him."
51,1,23,"However, you must remain firmly established and steadfast in the faith, without being moved from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven and of which I, Paul, have become a servant."
51,1,24,"Now I am rejoicing in my sufferings for you and completing in my flesh whatever remains of Christ's sufferings on behalf of his body, which is the church."
51,1,25,"I became its servant according to God's commission that was given to me for you, so that I might fulfill the ministry of the word of God."
51,1,26,"This secret was hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints,"
51,1,27,"to whom God wanted to make known the glorious riches of this secret among the Gentiles—which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."
51,1,28,"It is he whom we proclaim as we admonish everyone and teach everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ."
51,1,29,"I work hard and struggle to do this according to his energy that powerfully works in me."
51,2,1,"For I want you to know how much I struggle for you, for those in Laodicea, and for all who have never seen me face to face."
51,2,2,"Because they are united in love, I pray that their hearts may be encouraged by all the riches that come from a complete understanding of the full knowledge of Christ, who is the secret of God."
51,2,3,"In him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
51,2,4,"I say this so that no one will mislead you with nice-sounding rhetoric."
51,2,5,"For although I am absent in body, I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see how stable you are and how firm your faith in Christ is."
51,2,6,"So then, just as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, continue to live in him."
51,2,7,"For you have been rooted in him and are being built up and strengthened in the faith, just as you were taught, while you overflow with thanksgiving."
51,2,8,"See to it that no one enslaves you through philosophy and empty deceit according to human tradition, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ."
51,2,9,"For in him the whole fullness of God lives in bodily form."
51,2,10,"And you have been brought to fullness in him, who is the head of every ruler and authority."
51,2,11,"In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision performed without human hands by stripping off the corrupt nature in the circumcision performed by Christ."
51,2,12,"When you were buried with him in baptism, you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead."
51,2,13,"Even when you were dead because of your offenses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with him when he forgave us all of our offenses,"
51,2,14,"having erased the charges that were brought against us with their decrees that were hostile to us. He took those charges away when he nailed them to the cross."
51,2,15,"And when he had disarmed the rulers and the authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in the cross."
51,2,16,"Therefore, let no one judge you in matters of food and drink or with respect to a festival, a new moon, or a Sabbath day."
51,2,17,"These are a shadow of the things to come, but the reality belongs to Christ."
51,2,18,"Let no one who delights in humility and the worship of angels cheat you out of the prize by boasting about what he has seen. Such a person is puffed up without cause by his carnal mind."
51,2,19,"He does not hold on to the head, from whom the whole body, which is nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that comes from God."
51,2,20,"If you have died with Christ to the basic principles of the world, why are you submitting to its decrees as though you still lived in the world?"
51,2,21,"“Don't handle this! Don't taste or touch that!”"
51,2,22,"All of these things will be destroyed through use because they are based on human commands and teachings."
51,2,23,"These things have the appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion, humility, and harsh treatment of the body, but they have no value against self-indulgence."
51,3,1,"Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep focusing on the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God."
51,3,2,"Keep your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on the earth."
51,3,3,"For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
51,3,4,"When Christ your life is revealed, then you, too, will be revealed with him in glory."
51,3,5,"So put to death your worldly impulses: sexual sin, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry)."
51,3,6,"It is because of these things that the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient."
51,3,7,"You used to behave like them when you were living among them."
51,3,8,"But now you must also get rid of anger, wrath, malice, slander, obscene language from your mouth, and all such sins."
51,3,9,"Do not lie to one another, for you have stripped off the old man with its practices"
51,3,10,"and have clothed yourselves with the new man, which is being renewed into full knowledge according to the image of the one who created it."
51,3,11,"Where this happens, there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free person. Instead, Christ is all and in all."
51,3,12,"Therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience."
51,3,13,"Put up with one another and forgive each other if anyone has a complaint against another. Just as the Lord has forgiven you, you also should forgive."
51,3,14,"Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which ties everything together in unity."
51,3,15,"Let the peace of Christ also rule in your hearts, to which you were called in one body, and be thankful."
51,3,16,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you with all richness and wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and singing to God with thankfulness in your hearts."
51,3,17,"And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him."
51,3,18,"Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."
51,3,19,"Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them."
51,3,20,"Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord."
51,3,21,"Fathers, do not make your children resentful, lest they become discouraged."
51,3,22,"Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only while being watched in order to please them, but with a sincere heart, fearing the Lord."
51,3,23,"Whatever you do, work at it wholeheartedly as though you were doing it for the Lord and not merely for people."
51,3,24,"You know that it is from the Lord that you will receive the inheritance as a reward. It is the Lord Christ whom you are serving!"
51,3,25,"For the person who does what is wrong will be paid back for what he has done, and there is no favoritism."
51,4,1,"Masters, treat your slaves with justice and fairness, for you know that you also have a Master in heaven."
51,4,2,"Devote yourselves to prayer. Be alert when you pray with thanksgiving."
51,4,3,"At the same time also pray for us—that God would open before us a door for the word so that we may tell the secret about Christ, for which I have been imprisoned."
51,4,4,"May I reveal it as clearly as I should!"
51,4,5,"Behave wisely toward outsiders, making the best use of your time."
51,4,6,"Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone."
51,4,7,"Tychicus will tell you everything that has happened to me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Lord."
51,4,8,"I am sending him to you for this very reason, so that you may know how we are doing and that he may encourage your hearts."
51,4,9,"He is coming with Onesimus, that faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here."
51,4,10,"Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. You have received instructions about him. If he comes to you, welcome him."
51,4,11,"Jesus, who is called Justus, also greets you. These are the only ones of the circumcision who are fellow workers for the kingdom of God. They have been an encouragement to me."
51,4,12,"Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings. He is always wrestling in his prayers for you, so that you may stand mature and completely convinced of the entire will of God."
51,4,13,"For I can testify on his behalf that he has a deep concern for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hieropolis."
51,4,14,"Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you."
51,4,15,"Give my greetings to the brothers in Laodicea, especially to Nympha and the church that is in her house."
51,4,16,"When this letter has been read among you, have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans. And be sure to read the one from Laodicea."
51,4,17,"Tell Archippus, “See that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord.”"
51,4,18,"This greeting is by my own hand—“Paul.” Remember my imprisonment. May grace be with you! Amen."
52,1,1,"From Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!"
52,1,2,"We always thank God for all of you when we mention you in our prayers."
52,1,3,"In the presence of our God and Father, we constantly remember how your faith is active, your love is hard at work, and your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ is enduring."
52,1,4,"Brothers whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you,"
52,1,5,"for the gospel we brought did not come to you in words only, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit, and with deep conviction. Indeed, you know what kind of people we proved to be while we were with you, acting on your behalf."
52,1,6,"You became imitators of us and of the Lord. In spite of a great deal of suffering, you welcomed the word with the joy that the Holy Spirit produces."
52,1,7,"As a result, you became a model for all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia."
52,1,8,"From you the word of the Lord has spread out not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place where your faith in God has become known. As a result, we do not need to say anything."
52,1,9,"For people keep telling us what kind of welcome you gave us and how you turned away from idols to serve a living and true God"
52,1,10,"and to wait for his Son whom he raised from the dead to come back from heaven. This Jesus is the one who rescues us from the coming wrath."
52,2,1,"For you yourselves know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a waste of time."
52,2,2,"As you know, we suffered persecution and were mistreated in Philippi. Yet we were encouraged by our God to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition."
52,2,3,"For our appeal does not spring from deceit, impure motives, or trickery."
52,2,4,"Rather, because we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, we speak as we do, not trying to please people but God, who tests our motives."
52,2,5,"As you know, we did not come with words of flattery or with a scheme to make money. God is our witness!"
52,2,6,"We did not seek praise from people—from you or from anyone else—"
52,2,7,"even though as apostles of Christ we might have made such demands. Instead, we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother tenderly caring for her own children."
52,2,8,"We cared so deeply for you that we were determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but our very lives. That is how dear you were to us."
52,2,9,"You remember, brothers, our labor and toil. We worked night and day so that we would not become a burden to any of you while we proclaimed the gospel of God to you."
52,2,10,"You and God are witnesses of how pure, honest, and blameless our conduct was among you who believe."
52,2,11,"You know very well that we treated each of you the way a father treats his children."
52,2,12,"We comforted and encouraged you, urging you to live in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into his kingdom and glory."
52,2,13,"Here is another reason why we constantly give thanks to God: When you received God's word, which you heard from us, you did not accept it as the word of humans but for what it really is—the word of God, which is at work in you who believe."
52,2,14,"For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Judea that are in union with Christ Jesus. You suffered the same persecutions from the people of your own country as they did from those Jews"
52,2,15,"who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and have persecuted us. They are displeasing to God and are the enemies of all people,"
52,2,16,"because they try to keep us from telling the Gentiles how they can be saved. The result is that they are always adding to the measure of their sins. However, wrath has come on them at last!"
52,2,17,"Brothers, although we have been separated from you for a little while—in person but not in heart—we desire with great eagerness to see you again face to face."
52,2,18,"That is why we wanted to come to you. Certainly I, Paul, time and again wanted to come, but Satan blocked our way."
52,2,19,"After all, who is our hope, joy, or reason for boasting in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming? It is you, isn't it?"
52,2,20,"Yes, you are our glory and joy!"
52,3,1,"Therefore, when we could stand it no longer, we decided to remain alone in Athens"
52,3,2,"and send Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,"
52,3,3,"so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions. Indeed, you yourselves know that we were destined for this."
52,3,4,"In fact, when we were with you, we told you ahead of time that we were going to suffer persecution. And as you know, that is what happened."
52,3,5,"But when I could stand it no longer, I sent Timothy to find out about your faith. I was afraid that the tempter had tempted you in some way, and that our work had been a waste of time."
52,3,6,"But Timothy has just now come back to us from you and has told us the good news about your faith and love. He also told us that you always have fond memories of us and want to see us, just as we want to see you."
52,3,7,"That's why, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we have been encouraged about you by your faith."
52,3,8,"For now we can go on living, as long as you continue to stand firm in the Lord."
52,3,9,"How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy that we have in God's presence because of you?"
52,3,10,"We pray very hard night and day that we may see you again face to face, so that we may supply whatever is lacking in your faith."
52,3,11,"Now may our God and Father and our Lord Jesus guide us to you."
52,3,12,"May the Lord greatly increase your love for each other and for all people, just as we love you."
52,3,13,"Then your hearts will be strong in holiness and blameless in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his saints."
52,4,1,"Now then, brothers, you learned from us how you ought to live and to please God, as in fact you are doing. We ask and encourage you in the Lord to do so even more."
52,4,2,"You know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus."
52,4,3,"For it is God's will that you be sanctified: You must abstain from sexual immorality;"
52,4,4,"each of you must know how to control his own body in holiness and honor,"
52,4,5,"not with passion and lust like the Gentiles who do not know God;"
52,4,6,"and you must never take advantage of or exploit a brother in this regard. For the Lord is an avenger in all these things, just as we already told you and warned you."
52,4,7,"For God did not call us to impurity but to holiness."
52,4,8,"Therefore, whoever rejects this instruction is not rejecting human authority but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit."
52,4,9,"Now you do not need anyone to write to you about brotherly love, since you have been taught by God to love each other."
52,4,10,"In fact, you are showing love to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to do this even more."
52,4,11,"Also, make it your goal to live quietly, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we instructed you,"
52,4,12,"so that you may win the respect of outsiders, and have need of nothing."
52,4,13,"But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve like other people who have no hope."
52,4,14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so it is through Jesus that God will bring back with him those who have died."
52,4,15,"For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who have died."
52,4,16,"With a shout of command, with the archangel's call, and with the sound of God's trumpet, the Lord himself will come down from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first."
52,4,17,"Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever."
52,4,18,"So then, encourage one another with these words."
52,5,1,"Now you do not need to have anything written to you about times and dates, brothers,"
52,5,2,"for you yourselves know very well that the Day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night."
52,5,3,"When people say, “There is peace and security,” destruction will strike them as suddenly as labor pains come to a pregnant woman, and they will not be able to escape."
52,5,4,"However, brothers, you are not in the darkness, in order that the day might surprise you like a thief."
52,5,5,"For all of you are children of light and children of day. We do not belong to the night or to darkness."
52,5,6,"Therefore, let us not fall asleep like others do, but let us stay awake and be sober."
52,5,7,"For people who go to sleep, go to sleep at night; and people who get drunk, get drunk at night."
52,5,8,"But since we belong to the day, let us be sober. We must put on the breastplate of faith and love, and the hope of salvation as a helmet."
52,5,9,"For God has not destined us for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,"
52,5,10,"who died for us in order that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him."
52,5,11,"So then, encourage one another and build each other up, as you are doing."
52,5,12,"Brothers, we ask you to show your appreciation for those who work among you, set an example for you in the Lord, and instruct you."
52,5,13,"Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other."
52,5,14,"We urge you, brothers, to instruct those who are idle, cheer up those who are discouraged, and help those who are weak. Be patient with everyone."
52,5,15,"Make sure that no one pays back evil for evil. Instead, always pursue what is good for each other and for everyone else."
52,5,16,"Always be joyful."
52,5,17,"Continually be prayerful."
52,5,18,"In everything be thankful, because this is God's will in Christ Jesus for you."
52,5,19,"Do not put out the Spirit's fire."
52,5,20,"Do not despise prophecies."
52,5,21,"Instead, test everything. Hold on to what is good,"
52,5,22,"but keep away from every kind of evil."
52,5,23,"May the God of peace himself make you holy in every way. And may your whole being—spirit, soul, and body—be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
52,5,24,"The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do this."
52,5,25,"Brothers, pray for us."
52,5,26,"Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss."
52,5,27,"I order you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers."
52,5,28,"May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you! Amen."
53,1,1,"From Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in union with God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,1,2,"May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!"
53,1,3,"At all times we are obligated to thank God for you, brothers. It is right to do this because your faith is growing all the time and the love of every one of you for each other is increasing."
53,1,4,"As a result, we boast about you among God's churches—about your endurance and faith through all the persecutions and afflictions you are experiencing."
53,1,5,"This is evidence of God's righteous judgment and is intended to make you worthy of God's kingdom, for which you are suffering."
53,1,6,"Certainly it is right for God to pay back those who afflict you with affliction"
53,1,7,"and to give us who are afflicted relief when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels"
53,1,8,"in blazing fire. He will take revenge on those who do not know God and on those who refuse to obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus."
53,1,9,"Such people will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction by being separated from the Lord's presence and from his glorious power"
53,1,10,"when he comes to be glorified by his saints and to be regarded with wonder on that day by all who have believed—including you, because you believed our testimony."
53,1,11,"With this in mind, we always pray for you, asking that our God might make you worthy of his calling and that through his power he might help you accomplish every good desire and faithful work."
53,1,12,"That way the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified by you, and you by him, according to the grace of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ."
53,2,1,"Now we ask you, brothers, regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him,"
53,2,2,"not to be so quickly upset or alarmed when someone claims that we said either by some spirit, conversation, or letter that the Day of the Lord has already come."
53,2,3,"Do not let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day cannot come unless the rebellion takes place first and the man of sin, who is destined for destruction, is revealed."
53,2,4,"He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god and object of worship. As a result, he seats himself in the sanctuary of God and declares himself to be God."
53,2,5,"Don't you remember that I repeatedly told you about these things when I was still with you?"
53,2,6,"You know what it is that is now holding him back, so that he will be revealed when his time comes."
53,2,7,"For the secret of this lawlessness is already at work, but only until the person now holding it back gets out of the way."
53,2,8,"Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy with the breath of his mouth, rendering him powerless by the manifestation of his coming."
53,2,9,"The coming of the lawless one will be accompanied by the power of Satan. He will use every kind of power, including miraculous signs, lying wonders,"
53,2,10,"and every type of evil to deceive those who are dying, those who refused to love the truth that would save them."
53,2,11,"For this reason, God will send them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie."
53,2,12,"Then all who have not believed the truth but have taken pleasure in unrighteousness will be condemned."
53,2,13,"At all times we are obligated to thank God for you, brothers who are loved by the Lord, because God chose you to be the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through faith in the truth."
53,2,14,"With this purpose in mind, he called you through our proclamation of the gospel so that you would obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,15,"So then, brothers, stand firm, and cling to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by our letter."
53,2,16,"May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope,"
53,2,17,"encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good work and word."
53,3,1,"Finally, brothers, pray for us—that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly, and that it may be honored the way it is among you."
53,3,2,"Also pray that we may be rescued from worthless and evil people, since not everyone holds to the faith."
53,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful and will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one."
53,3,4,"We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do what we command."
53,3,5,"May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the endurance of Christ."
53,3,6,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we command you, brothers, to keep away from every brother who is living in idleness and not living according to the tradition that they received from us."
53,3,7,"For you yourselves know what you must do to imitate us. We did not live in idleness among you."
53,3,8,"We did not eat anyone's food without paying for it. Instead, with toil and labor we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you."
53,3,9,"It is not as though we did not have that right, but, we wanted to give you an example to follow."
53,3,10,"While we were with you, we gave this order: “If anyone doesn't want to work, he shouldn't eat.”"
53,3,11,"We hear that some of you are living in idleness. You are not busy working—you are busy interfering in other people's lives!"
53,3,12,"We order and encourage such people by the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living."
53,3,13,"Brothers, do not get tired of doing what is right."
53,3,14,"If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of him. Have nothing to do with him so that he will feel ashamed."
53,3,15,"Yet, don't treat him like an enemy, but warn him like a brother."
53,3,16,"Now may the Lord of peace give you his peace at all times and in every way. May the Lord be with all of you."
53,3,17,"I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand. This is the mark in every letter of mine. It is the way I write."
53,3,18,"May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen."
54,1,1,"From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope,"
54,1,2,"to Timothy, my genuine child in the faith. May grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord be yours!"
54,1,3,"When I was on my way to Macedonia, I urged you to stay in Ephesus so that you could instruct certain people to stop teaching false doctrine"
54,1,4,"and occupying themselves with myths and endless genealogies. These things promote controversies rather than God's ongoing purpose, which involves faith."
54,1,5,"The goal of this instruction is love that flows from a pure heart, from a clear conscience, and from a sincere faith."
54,1,6,"Some people have left these qualities behind and have turned to fruitless discussion."
54,1,7,"They want to be teachers of the law, yet they do not understand either what they are talking about or the things about which they speak so confidently."
54,1,8,"Of course, we know that the law is good if a person uses it legitimately,"
54,1,9,"that is, if he understands that the law is not intended for righteous people but for lawbreakers and rebels, for ungodly people and sinners, for those who are unholy and irreverent, for those who kill their fathers, their mothers, or other people,"
54,1,10,"for those involved in sexual immorality, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for false witnesses, and for whatever else goes against the healthy teaching"
54,1,11,"that agrees with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me."
54,1,12,"I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who gives me strength, that he has considered me faithful and has appointed me to his service."
54,1,13,"In the past I was a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man. But I received mercy because I acted ignorantly in my unbelief,"
54,1,14,"and the grace of our Lord overflowed toward me, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus."
54,1,15,"This saying is trustworthy and deserves complete acceptance:	To this world Christ Jesus came,Sinful people to reclaim.I am the worst of them."
54,1,16,"But for that very reason I received mercy, so that in me, as the worst sinner, Christ Jesus might demonstrate all of his patience as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life."
54,1,17,"Now to the King Eternal—the immortal, invisible, and only God—be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen."
54,1,18,"Timothy, my child, I am giving you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies made earlier about you, so that by following them you may continue to fight the good fight"
54,1,19,"with faith and a good conscience. By ignoring their consciences, some people have destroyed their faith like a wrecked ship."
54,1,20,"These include Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme."
54,2,1,"First of all, then, I urge you to offer petitions, prayers, intercessions, and expressions of thanks for all people,"
54,2,2,"for kings, and for everyone who has authority, so that we might lead a quiet and peaceful life with all godliness and dignity."
54,2,3,"This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,"
54,2,4,"who wants all people to be saved and to come to a full knowledge of the truth."
54,2,5,"There is one God. There is also one mediator between God and human beings—a human, Christ Jesus."
54,2,6,"He gave himself as a ransom for all, a fact that was acknowledged at the right time."
54,2,7,"For this reason I was appointed to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. (I am telling you the truth. I am not lying.)"
54,2,8,"Therefore, I want the men to offer prayers in every place, lifting up holy hands without being angry or argumentative."
54,2,9,"Women, for their part, should display their beauty by dressing modestly and decently in appropriate clothes, not by braiding their hair or by wearing gold, pearls, or expensive clothes,"
54,2,10,"but through good works. This is proper for women who claim to have reverence for God."
54,2,11,"A woman must learn quietly with full submission."
54,2,12,"Moreover, I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man. Instead, she is to be quiet."
54,2,13,"For Adam was formed first, then Eve."
54,2,14,"And it was not Adam who was deceived. It was the woman who was deceived and became a lawbreaker."
54,2,15,"However, women will be saved by having children, if they continue to have faith, love, and holiness, along with good judgment."
54,3,1,"This saying is trustworthy:	The one who would an elder be,		A noble task desires he."
54,3,2,"Therefore, an elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, stable, sensible, respectable, a lover of strangers, and teachable."
54,3,3,"He must not drink excessively or be a violent person, but instead be gentle. He must not be argumentative or a lover of money."
54,3,4,"He must manage his own family well and have children who are submissive and respectful in every way."
54,3,5,"For if a man does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?"
54,3,6,"He must not be a recent convert, or he might become arrogant and fall into the condemnation of the devil."
54,3,7,"He must be well thought of by outsiders, lest he fall into disgrace and the trap set for him by the devil."
54,3,8,"Deacons, too, must be serious. They must not be two-faced, addicted to wine, or greedy for money."
54,3,9,"They must hold firmly to the secret of the faith with clear consciences."
54,3,10,"But they must first be tested. Then, if they prove to be blameless, they may become deacons."
54,3,11,"Their wives must also be serious. They must not be gossips, but instead be stable and trustworthy in everything."
54,3,12,"Deacons must be husbands of one wife and must manage their children and their families well."
54,3,13,"Those deacons who serve well gain an excellent reputation for themselves and will have great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus."
54,3,14,"I hope to come to you soon. However, I'm writing this to you"
54,3,15,"in case I am delayed so that you may know how one is to behave in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth."
54,3,16,"By common confession, the secret of our godly worship is great:	In flesh was he revealed to sight,Kept righteous by the Spirit's might,Adored by angels singing.	To nations was he manifest,Believing souls found peace and rest,Our Lord in heaven reigning!"
54,4,1,"Now the Spirit says clearly that in the last times some people will abandon the faith by following deceitful spirits, the teachings of demons,"
54,4,2,"and the hypocrisy of liars, whose consciences have been burned by a hot iron."
54,4,3,"They will try to stop people from marrying and from eating certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth."
54,4,4,"For everything God created is good, and nothing should be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,"
54,4,5,"because it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer."
54,4,6,"If you continue to point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of the faith and the healthy teaching that you have followed closely."
54,4,7,"Do not have anything to do with godless myths and fables of old women, but train yourself in godliness."
54,4,8,"Physical exercise is of limited value, but	Godliness is very dear,A pledge of life, both there and here."
54,4,9,"This saying is trustworthy and deserves complete acceptance."
54,4,10,"To this end we work hard and struggle, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, that is, of those who believe."
54,4,11,"These are the things you must insist on and teach."
54,4,12,"Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but be an example for other believers in your speech, behavior, love, faithfulness, and purity."
54,4,13,"Until I arrive, concentrate on the public reading of Scripture, on exhorting, and on teaching."
54,4,14,"Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy, accompanied by the laying on of the elders’ hands."
54,4,15,"Think on these things. Devote your life to them so that everyone can see your progress."
54,4,16,"Pay close attention to your life and your teaching. Persevere in these things, for if you do this, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you."
54,5,1,"Never speak harshly to an older man, but appeal to him as if he were your father. Treat younger men like brothers,"
54,5,2,"older women like mothers, and younger women like sisters, with absolutely purity."
54,5,3,"Honor widows who are really widows."
54,5,4,"But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to respect their own family by repaying their parents, for this is pleasing in God's sight."
54,5,5,"A woman who is really a widow and is left all alone has placed her hope in God and devotes herself to petitions and prayers night and day."
54,5,6,"But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead while she lives."
54,5,7,"Continue to give these instructions so that they may be blameless."
54,5,8,"If anyone does not take care of his own relatives, especially his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
54,5,9,"A widow may be put on the widows' list if she is at least sixty years old and has been the wife of one husband."
54,5,10,"She must be well known for her good works as a woman who has raised children, welcomed strangers, washed the saints’ feet, helped the suffering, and devoted herself to doing good in every way."
54,5,11,"But do not include younger widows on your list. For whenever their natural desires cause them to lose their devotion to Christ, they want to remarry."
54,5,12,"They receive condemnation because they have set aside their previous pledge."
54,5,13,"At the same time, they also learn how to be lazy while going from house to house. Not only this, but they even become gossips and keep busy by interfering in other people's lives, saying things they should not say."
54,5,14,"Therefore, I want younger widows to remarry, have children, manage their homes, and not give the enemy any chance to ridicule them."
54,5,15,"For some widows have already turned away to follow Satan."
54,5,16,"If any woman is a believer and has relatives who are widows, she should help them. The church should not be burdened so that it can help those who really are widows."
54,5,17,"Elders who handle their duties well should be considered worthy of double compensation, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching."
54,5,18,"For the Scripture says, “You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading out grain,” and"
54,5,19,"Do not accept an accusation against an elder unless it is supported by two or three witnesses."
54,5,20,"As for those who keep on sinning, rebuke them in front of everyone so that the others will also be afraid."
54,5,21,"In the sight of God, Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, I solemnly call on you to carry out these instructions without prejudice, doing nothing on the basis of partiality."
54,5,22,"Do not ordain anyone hastily. Do not participate in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure."
54,5,23,"Stop drinking only water, but use a little wine for your stomach because of your frequent illnesses."
54,5,24,"The sins of some people are obvious, going ahead of them to judgment. The sins of others follow them there."
54,5,25,"In the same way, good works are obvious, and those that are not cannot remain hidden."
54,6,1,"All who are under the yoke of slavery should regard their own masters as deserving of the highest respect, so that the name of God and our teaching may not be discredited."
54,6,2,"Moreover, those who have believing masters should not be disrespectful to them because they are fellow believers. Instead, they must serve them even better, because those who benefit from their service are believers and dear to them. These are the things you must teach and exhort."
54,6,3,"If anyone teaches false doctrine and refuses to agree with the healthy words of our Lord Jesus Christ and godly teaching,"
54,6,4,"he is a conceited person and does not understand anything. He has an unhealthy craving for arguments and debates. This produces jealousy, rivalry, slander, evil suspicions,"
54,6,5,"and incessant conflict between people who are depraved in mind and deprived of truth. They think that godliness is a way to make a profit."
54,6,6,"Of course, godliness with contentment does bring a great profit."
54,6,7,"For we did not bring anything into the world, and surely we cannot take anything out of it."
54,6,8,"So as long as we have food and clothes, we will be satisfied with these."
54,6,9,"But people who want to get rich keep toppling into temptation and are trapped by many stupid and harmful desires that plunge them into destruction and ruin."
54,6,10,"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, in their eagerness to get rich, have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with much pain."
54,6,11,"But you, man of God, must flee from all these things. Instead, you must pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, endurance, and gentleness."
54,6,12,"Fight the good fight for the faith. Keep your hold on eternal life, to which you were called and about which you gave a good testimony in front of many witnesses."
54,6,13,"In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and in the sight of Christ Jesus, who gave a good testimony before Pontius Pilate, I solemnly charge you"
54,6,14,"to keep this command stainless and blameless until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ."
54,6,15,"At the right time God will make him known. He is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords."
54,6,16,"He alone has endless life and lives in inaccessible light. No one has ever seen him, nor can anyone see him. Honor and eternal power belong to him! Amen."
54,6,17,"Tell those who are rich in the present world not to be arrogant and not to place their confidence in anything as uncertain as riches. Instead, let them place their confidence in God, who lavishly provides us with everything for our enjoyment."
54,6,18,"They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, and to share."
54,6,19,"By doing this they store up a treasure for themselves that is a good foundation for the future, so that they can take hold of the life that is real."
54,6,20,"Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the pointless discussions and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge."
54,6,21,"Although some claim to have it, they have abandoned the faith. May grace be with all of you!"
55,1,1,"From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,"
55,1,2,"to Timothy, my dear child. May grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord be yours!"
55,1,3,"I constantly thank my God—whom I serve with a clear conscience, as my ancestors did—when I remember you in my prayers night and day,"
55,1,4,"recalling your tears and longing to see you so that I can be filled with joy."
55,1,5,"I am reminded of your sincere faith, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced that this faith also lives in you."
55,1,6,"For this reason, I am reminding you to fan into flames the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands."
55,1,7,"For God did not give us a spirit of timidity but one of power, love, and self-discipline."
55,1,8,"Therefore, never be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me, his prisoner. Instead, by God's power, join me in suffering for the sake of the gospel."
55,1,9,"He saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our own works but according to his own purpose and the grace that was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began."
55,1,10,"Now, however, it has been revealed through the coming of our Savior Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and through the gospel has brought life and release from death into full view."
55,1,11,"For the sake of this gospel I was appointed to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."
55,1,12,"That is why I suffer as I do. However, I am not ashamed, for I know the one in whom I have put my trust, and I'm convinced that he is able to protect what he has entrusted to me until that day."
55,1,13,"Hold on to the pattern of healthy teachings that you have heard from me, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus."
55,1,14,"With the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us, protect the good treasure that has been entrusted to you."
55,1,15,"You know that everyone in Asia has abandoned me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes."
55,1,16,"May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, for he often took care of me and was not ashamed that I was a prisoner."
55,1,17,"Instead, when he arrived in Rome he searched diligently for me and found me."
55,1,18,"May the Lord grant that he finds mercy from the Lord on that day. You know very well how much he assisted me in Ephesus."
55,2,1,"As for you, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
55,2,2,"What you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be able to teach others as well."
55,2,3,"Join me in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus."
55,2,4,"No one serving in the military gets mixed up in civilian matters, for his aim is to please his commanding officer."
55,2,5,"Moreover, no one who is an athlete wins a prize unless he competes according to the rules."
55,2,6,"Furthermore, it is the hard working farmer who should have the first share of the crops."
55,2,7,"Think about what I am saying. The Lord will help you to understand all these things."
55,2,8,"Meditate on Jesus Christ, who was raised from the dead and is a descendant of David. This is the gospel I tell others."
55,2,9,"Because of it I am experiencing trouble, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. However, God's word is not chained."
55,2,10,"For that reason, I endure everything for the sake of those who have been chosen so that they, too, may receive the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, along with eternal glory."
55,2,11,"This saying is trustworthy:	In dying with Christ,true life we gain."
55,2,12,"Enduring, we with him shall reign.Who him denies,he will disclaim."
55,2,13,"Our faith may fail,his never wanes—	For thus he is,he cannot change!"
55,2,14,"Remind others about these things, and warn them in the sight of God not to argue over words. Arguing does not do any good but only destroys those who are listening."
55,2,15,"Do your best to present yourself to God as an approved worker who has nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of truth with precision."
55,2,16,"However, avoid pointless discussions. For people will become more and more ungodly,"
55,2,17,"and what they say will spread everywhere like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are like that."
55,2,18,"They have abandoned the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place, and so they destroy the faith of others."
55,2,19,"However, God's solid foundation still stands. It has this inscription on it: “The Lord knows those who belong to him,” and “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from evil.”"
55,2,20,"In a large house there are not only utensils made of gold and silver, but also those made of wood and clay. Some are for special use, while others are for ordinary use."
55,2,21,"Therefore, if anyone stops associating with these people, he will become a special utensil, set apart for the owner's use, prepared for every good work."
55,2,22,"Flee from youthful passions. Instead, pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace together with those who call on the Lord with a pure heart."
55,2,23,"Do not have anything to do with foolish and stupid discussions, because you know they breed arguments."
55,2,24,"A servant of the Lord must not argue. Instead, he must be kind to everyone, teachable, willing to suffer wrong,"
55,2,25,"and gentle in refuting his opponents. After all, maybe God will allow them to repent and to come to a full knowledge of the truth,"
55,2,26,"so that they might escape from the devil's snare, even though they've been held captive by him to do his will."
55,3,1,"You must realize, however, that in the last days difficult times will come."
55,3,2,"People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,"
55,3,3,"unfeeling, uncooperative, slanderous, degenerate, brutal, hateful of what is good,"
55,3,4,"traitors, reckless, conceited, and lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God."
55,3,5,"They will hold to an outward form of godliness but deny its power. Stay away from such people."
55,3,6,"For some of these men go into homes and deceive foolish women who are burdened with sins and swayed by all kinds of desires."
55,3,7,"These women are always studying but are never able to arrive at a full knowledge of the truth."
55,3,8,"Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men oppose the truth. They are depraved in mind and their faith is a counterfeit."
55,3,9,"But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those two men, their stupidity will be plain to everyone."
55,3,10,"But you have observed my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance,"
55,3,11,"and my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them."
55,3,12,"Indeed, all who want to live a godly life in union with Christ Jesus will be persecuted."
55,3,13,"But evil people and impostors will go from bad to worse as they deceive others and are themselves deceived."
55,3,14,"But as for you, continue in what you have learned and found to be true, because you know from whom you learned it."
55,3,15,"From infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures that are able to give you the wisdom you need for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus."
55,3,16,"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,"
55,3,17,"so that the man of God may be complete and thoroughly equipped for every good work."
55,4,1,"In the presence of God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge those who are living and those who are dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I solemnly appeal to you"
55,4,2,"to proclaim the message. Be ready to do this whether or not the time is convenient. Refute, warn, and encourage with the utmost patience when you teach."
55,4,3,"For the time will come when people will not put up with healthy doctrine but with itching ears will surround themselves with teachers who cater to their own needs."
55,4,4,"They will refuse to listen to the truth and will turn to myths."
55,4,5,"But you must be clear-headed about everything. Endure suffering. Do the work of an evangelist. Devote yourself completely to your ministry."
55,4,6,"For I am already being poured out as an offering, and the time for my departure has come."
55,4,7,"I have fought the good fight. I have completed the race. I have kept the faith."
55,4,8,"The victor's crown of righteousness is now waiting for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who eagerly wait for his appearing."
55,4,9,"Do your best to come to me soon."
55,4,10,"For Demas, having fallen in love with this present world, has abandoned me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia."
55,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful in my ministry."
55,4,12,"I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus."
55,4,13,"When you come, bring the coat I left with Carpus in Troas, as well as the scrolls and especially the parchments."
55,4,14,"Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will pay him back for what he did."
55,4,15,"You, too, must watch out for him, for he violently opposed our message."
55,4,16,"At my first trial no one came to my defense. Everyone abandoned me. May it not be held against them!"
55,4,17,"However, the Lord stood by me and gave me strength so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles could hear it. I was rescued out of a lion's mouth."
55,4,18,"The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will take me safely to his heavenly kingdom. Glory belongs to him forever and ever! Amen."
55,4,19,"Greet Prisca and Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus."
55,4,20,"Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus in Miletus because he was sick."
55,4,21,"Do your best to come to me before winter. Eubulus sends you greetings, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers."
55,4,22,"May the Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with all of you! Amen."
56,1,1,"From Paul, a servant of God, and yet an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's elect and the full knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,"
56,1,2,"which is based on the hope of eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began."
56,1,3,"At the right time he revealed his message through the proclamation that was entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior."
56,1,4,"To Titus, a genuine child in the faith we share. May grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior be yours!"
56,1,5,"The reason I left you in Crete was to complete what still needed to be done and to appoint elders in every city, as I myself commanded you."
56,1,6,"An elder must be blameless. He must be the husband of one wife and have children who are believers and who are not accused of having wild lifestyles or of being rebellious."
56,1,7,"Because an overseer is God's administrator, he must be blameless. He must not be arrogant or irritable. He must not drink too much, be a violent person, or use shameful ways to make money."
56,1,8,"Instead, he must be a lover of strangers, a lover of goodness, sensible, honest, moral, and self-controlled."
56,1,9,"He must be devoted to the trustworthy message that is in agreement with our teaching, so that he may be able to encourage others with healthy doctrine and refute those who oppose it."
56,1,10,"For there are many people who are rebellious, especially those who are converts from Judaism. They speak utter nonsense and deceive people."
56,1,11,"They must be silenced, because they are the kind of people who ruin whole families by teaching what they should not teach in order to make money in a shameful way."
56,1,12,"One of their very own prophets said,	“Liars ever, men of Crete,Savage brutes that live to eat.”"
56,1,13,"That testimony is true. For this reason, refute them sharply so that they may become healthy in the faith"
56,1,14,"and not pay attention to Jewish myths or commands given by people who reject the truth."
56,1,15,"Everything is clean to those who are clean, but nothing is clean to those who are corrupt and unbelieving. Indeed, their very way of thinking and their consciences have been corrupted."
56,1,16,"They claim to know God, but they deny him by their actions. They are detestable, disobedient, and disqualified to do anything good."
56,2,1,"But as for you, teach what is consistent with healthy doctrine."
56,2,2,"Older men are to be sober, serious, sensible, and sound in faithfulness, love, and endurance."
56,2,3,"Likewise, older women are to show their reverence for God by their behavior. They are not to be gossips or addicted to alcohol, but to be examples of goodness."
56,2,4,"They should encourage the younger women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children,"
56,2,5,"sensible, pure, managers of their households, and kind, and to submit themselves to their husbands, lest the word of God be discredited."
56,2,6,"Likewise, encourage the younger men to be sensible."
56,2,7,"Always set an example of good works. When you teach, show integrity and dignity."
56,2,8,"Use wholesome speech that cannot be condemned. Then any opponent will be ashamed because he cannot say anything bad about us."
56,2,9,"Slaves are to submit themselves to their masters in everything, aiming to please them and not argue with them"
56,2,10,"or steal from them. Instead, they are to show complete and perfect loyalty, so that in every way they may make the teaching about God our Savior more attractive."
56,2,11,"For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people."
56,2,12,"It trains us to renounce ungodly living and worldly passions so that we might live sensible, honest, and godly lives in the present world"
56,2,13,"as we wait for the blessed hope and the glorious appearance of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ."
56,2,14,"He gave himself for us to set us free from every wrong and to cleanse us so that we could be his special people who are enthusiastic about good works."
56,2,15,"These are the things you should say. Encourage and refute with full authority. Do not let anyone look down on you."
56,3,1,"Remind believers to submit themselves to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, and to be ready to do any honorable kind of work."
56,3,2,"They are not to insult anyone or be argumentative. Instead, they are to be gentle and show perfect courtesy to everyone."
56,3,3,"After all, we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, and misled. We were slaves to many kinds of lusts and pleasures, spending our days in malice and jealousy. We were despised, and we hated one another."
56,3,4,"However,	In grace our Savior God appeared,His love for mankind to make clear."
56,3,5,"‘Twas not for deeds that we had done, But by his steadfast love alone,	He saved us through a second birth,Renewed us by the Spirit's work,"
56,3,6,"And poured him out upon us, too,Through Jesus Christ our Savior true."
56,3,7,"And so, made right by his own grace,Eternal life we now embrace."
56,3,8,"This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have put their faith in God may devote themselves to good works. These things are good and helpful to other people."
56,3,9,"But avoid foolish controversies, arguments about genealogies, quarrels, and fights about the law. These things are useless and worthless."
56,3,10,"Have nothing to do with a person who causes divisions after you have warned him once or twice."
56,3,11,"For you know that a person like this is corrupt and keeps on sinning, being self-condemned."
56,3,12,"As soon as I send Artemas to you, or perhaps Tychicus, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there."
56,3,13,"Do all you can to send Zenas the expert in the law and Apollos on their way, and see that they have everything they need."
56,3,14,"Our own people should also learn to devote themselves to good works when urgent needs arise, lest they be unproductive."
56,3,15,"All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. May grace be with all of you! Amen."
57,1,1,"From Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,"
57,1,2,"to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house."
57,1,3,"May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!"
57,1,4,"I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,"
57,1,5,"because I keep hearing about your love and the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints."
57,1,6,"I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective as you fully acknowledge every blessing that is ours in Christ."
57,1,7,"For I have received considerable joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed, brother, through you."
57,1,8,"For this reason, although in Christ I have complete freedom to order you to do what is proper,"
57,1,9,"I prefer to make my appeal on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus,"
57,1,10,"appeal to you on behalf of my child Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment."
57,1,11,"Once he was useless to you, but now he is very useful both to you and to me."
57,1,12,"I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you."
57,1,13,"I wanted to keep him with me so that he could serve me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel."
57,1,14,"Yet I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed might not be something forced, but voluntary."
57,1,15,"Perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a while, so that you could have him back forever,"
57,1,16,"no longer as a slave but better than a slave—as a dear brother, especially to me, but even more so to you, both as a person and as a believer."
57,1,17,"So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me."
57,1,18,"If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to my account."
57,1,19,"I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand: I will repay it. (I will not mention to you that you owe me your very life.)"
57,1,20,"Yes, brother, I desire this favor from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ!"
57,1,21,"Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you because I know that you will do even more than I ask."
57,1,22,"Meanwhile, prepare a guest room for me, too, for I am hoping through your prayers to be returned to you."
57,1,23,"Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings,"
57,1,24,"as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers."
57,1,25,"May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit! Amen."
58,1,1,"God, having spoken in former times in fragmentary and varied fashion to our forefathers by the prophets,"
58,1,2,"has in these last days spoken to us by a Son whom he appointed to be the heir of everything and through whom he also made the universe."
58,1,3,"He is the reflection of God's glory and the exact likeness of his being, and he holds everything together by his powerful word. After he had provided a cleansing from sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Highest Majesty"
58,1,4,"and became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is better than theirs."
58,1,5,"For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father”? Or again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son”?"
58,1,6,"And again, when he brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all God's angels worship him.”"
58,1,7,"Now about the angels he says, 	“He makes his angels winds,and his servants flames of fire.”"
58,1,8,"But about the Son he says,	“Your throne, O God,is forever and ever,	and the scepter of your kingdomis a righteous scepter."
58,1,9,"You have loved righteousnessand hated wickedness.	That is why God, your God,anointed you rather than your companionswith the oil of gladness.”"
58,1,10,"And,	“In the beginning, Lord,you laid the foundation of the earth,and the heavens are the work of your hands."
58,1,11,"They will come to an end,but you will remain forever.They will all wear out like clothes."
58,1,12,"You will roll them up like a robe,and they will be changed like clothes.	But you remain the same,and your years will never end.”"
58,1,13,"But to which of the angels did he ever say,	“Sit at my right handuntil I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”?"
58,1,14,"All of them are spirits on a divine mission, sent to serve those who are about to inherit salvation, aren't they?"
58,2,1,"For this reason we must pay closer attention to the things we have heard, or we may drift away."
58,2,2,"For if the message spoken by angels was reliable, and every violation and act of disobedience received its just punishment,"
58,2,3,"how will we escape if we neglect a salvation as great as this? It was first proclaimed by the Lord himself, and then it was confirmed to us by those who heard him,"
58,2,4,"while God added his testimony through signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will."
58,2,5,"For he did not put the coming world we are talking about under the control of angels."
58,2,6,"Instead, someone has declared somewhere,	“What is man that you should remember him,or the son of man that you should care for him?"
58,2,7,"You made him a little lower than the angels,yet you crowned him with glory and honor"
58,2,8,"and put everything under his feet.”Now when God put everything under him, he left nothing outside his control. However, at the present time we do not yet see everything put under him."
58,2,9,"But we do see someone who was made a little lower than the angels. He is Jesus, who is crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might experience death for everyone."
58,2,10,"In bringing many children to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering."
58,2,11,"For both the one who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified all have the same Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers"
58,2,12,"when he says, “I will announce your name to my brothers. I will praise you within the congregation.”"
58,2,13,"And again, “I will trust him.” And again, “I am here with the children God has given me.”"
58,2,14,"Therefore, since the children have flesh and blood, he himself also shared the same things, so that by his death he might destroy the one who has the power of death (that is, the devil)"
58,2,15,"and might free those who were slaves all their lives because they were terrified by death."
58,2,16,"For it is clear that he did not come to help angels. No, he came to help Abraham's descendants."
58,2,17,"Thus he had to become like his brothers in every way, so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God and could atone for the people's sins."
58,2,18,"Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted."
58,3,1,"Therefore, holy brothers, partners in a heavenly calling, keep your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession."
58,3,2,"He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was in all God's household."
58,3,3,"For he is worthy of greater glory than Moses in the same way that the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself."
58,3,4,"After all, every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything."
58,3,5,"Moses was faithful in all God's household as a servant who was to testify to what would be said later,"
58,3,6,"but Christ was faithful as the Son in charge of God's household, and we are his household if we hold on to our courage and the hope that we boast about."
58,3,7,"Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,	“Today, if you hear his voice,"
58,3,8,"do not harden your heartsas they did when they provoked meduring the time of testing in the wilderness."
58,3,9,"There your ancestors tested me,even though they had seen my works"
58,3,10,"for forty years.	That is why I was indignant with that generation and said,‘They are always going astray in their hearts,and they have not known my ways.’"
58,3,11,"So in my anger I swore a solemn oaththat they would never enter my rest.”"
58,3,12,"See to it, my brothers, that no evil, unbelieving heart is found in any of you, as shown by your turning away from the living God."
58,3,13,"Instead, continue to encourage one another every day, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
58,3,14,"For we are Christ's partners only if we hold on to our original confidence to the end."
58,3,15,"As it is said,	“Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts as they didwhen they provoked me.”"
58,3,16,"Now who heard him and provoked him? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?"
58,3,17,"And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned and whose bodies fell in the wilderness?"
58,3,18,"And to whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest, if not to those who disobeyed him?"
58,3,19,"So we see that they were unable to enter because of their unbelief."
58,4,1,"Therefore, as long as the promise of entering his rest remains valid, let us be afraid lest someone among you fails to reach it."
58,4,2,"For we have had the good news told to us as well as to them, but the message they heard did not help them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened to it."
58,4,3,"For we who have believed are entering that rest, just as he has said,	“So in my anger I swore a solemn oaththat they would never enter my rest,”even though his works had been finished since the foundation of the world."
58,4,4,"For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day as follows: “On the seventh day God rested from all his works,”"
58,4,5,"and again in this place, “They will never enter my rest.”"
58,4,6,"Therefore, since it is still true that some will enter it, and since those who once heard the good news failed to enter it because of their disobedience,"
58,4,7,"he again fixes a definite day—“Today”—saying long afterward through David, as already quoted,	“Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts.”"
58,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken later about another day."
58,4,9,"There remains, therefore, a Sabbath rest for the people of God."
58,4,10,"For the one who enters God's rest has himself rested from his own works, just as God did from his."
58,4,11,"Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fail by following their example of disobedience."
58,4,12,"For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul and spirit, joints and marrow, as it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart."
58,4,13,"No creature can hide from him, but all are naked and helpless before the eyes of the one to whom we must give a word of explanation."
58,4,14,"Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us continue to hold on to our confession."
58,4,15,"For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin."
58,4,16,"So let us keep on coming with boldness to the throne of grace, so that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need."
58,5,1,"For every high priest selected from among men is appointed to officiate on their behalf in matters relating to God, that is, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins."
58,5,2,"He can deal gently with people who are ignorant and easily deceived, since he himself is subject to weakness."
58,5,3,"For that reason he is obligated to offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as for those of the people."
58,5,4,"No one takes this honor upon himself but he is called to it by God, just as Aaron was."
58,5,5,"In the same way, Christ did not take upon himself the glory of being a high priest. No, it was God who said to him,	“You are my Son.Today I have become your Father.”"
58,5,6,"As he also says in another place,	“You are a priest foreveraccording to the order of Melchizedek.”"
58,5,7,"In the days of his flesh, he offered up prayers and appeals with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his devotion to God."
58,5,8,"Son though he was, he learned obedience through his sufferings"
58,5,9,"and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,"
58,5,10,"having been designated by God to be a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek."
58,5,11,"We have much to say about this, but it is difficult to explain because you have become too lazy to understand."
58,5,12,"In fact, though by now you should be teachers, you still need someone to teach you the basic truths of God's word. You have become people who need milk instead of solid food."
58,5,13,"For everyone who lives on milk is still a baby and is inexperienced in the message of righteousness."
58,5,14,"But solid food is for mature people, whose minds are trained by practice to distinguish good from evil."
58,6,1,"Therefore, leaving behind the elementary teachings about Christ, let us continue to be carried along to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, faith toward God,"
58,6,2,"instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment."
58,6,3,"And this we will do, if God permits."
58,6,4,"For it is impossible to keep on restoring to repentance time and again people who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have become sharers of the Holy Spirit,"
58,6,5,"who have tasted the goodness of God's word and the powers of the coming age,"
58,6,6,"and who have fallen away, as long as they continue to crucify to themselves the Son of God and to expose him to public ridicule."
58,6,7,"For when the ground soaks up rain that often falls on it and continues producing vegetation useful to those for whom it is cultivated, it receives a blessing from God."
58,6,8,"However, if it continues to produce thorns and thistles, it is worthless and in danger of being cursed, and in the end will be burned."
58,6,9,"Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case, things that point to salvation."
58,6,10,"For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have ministered to the saints and continue to minister to them."
58,6,11,"But we want each of you to continue to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to give full assurance to your hope."
58,6,12,"Then, instead of being lazy, you will become imitators of those who are inheriting the promises through faith and patience."
58,6,13,"For when God made his promise to Abraham, he swore an oath by himself, since he had no one greater to swear by."
58,6,14,"He said, “I will certainly bless you and give you many descendants.”"
58,6,15,"And so he obtained the promise, because he patiently waited for it."
58,6,16,"For people swear by someone greater than themselves, and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all argument."
58,6,17,"In the same way, when God wanted to make the unchangeable character of his purpose perfectly clear to the heirs of his promise, he guaranteed it with an oath,"
58,6,18,"so that by these two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to prove false, we who have taken refuge in him might have a strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us."
58,6,19,"We have this hope as an anchor for our souls, firm and secure, which reaches behind the curtain,"
58,6,20,"where Jesus, our forerunner, has gone on our behalf, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
58,7,1,"Now this man Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, met Abraham and blessed him when he was returning from slaughtering the kings."
58,7,2,"To him Abraham gave a tenth of everything. In the first place, his name means “king of righteousness,” and then he is also king of Salem, that is, “king of peace.”"
58,7,3,"He has no father, mother, or genealogy, and has neither beginning of days nor end of life. Like the Son of God, he continues to be a priest forever."
58,7,4,"Just look at how great this man was! Even Abraham—the patriarch himself—gave him a tenth of what he had captured!"
58,7,5,"The descendants of Levi who accept the priesthood have a commandment in the law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their own brothers, even though they are also descendants of Abraham."
58,7,6,"But this man, whose descent is not traced from them, collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the man who had received the promises."
58,7,7,"It is beyond dispute that the less important person is blessed by the more important person."
58,7,8,"The men who collect the tenth die, but we are told that he keeps on living."
58,7,9,"One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,"
58,7,10,"for he was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him."
58,7,11,"Now if perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—for on this basis the people received the law—what further need would there be to speak of appointing another kind of priest according to the order of Melchizedek, not one according to the order of Aaron?"
58,7,12,"For when a change in the priesthood takes place, there must also be a change in the law."
58,7,13,"For the person we are talking about belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar."
58,7,14,"For it is obvious that our Lord was a descendant of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests coming from that tribe."
58,7,15,"This point is even more obvious in that another priest who is like Melchizedek has appeared"
58,7,16,"who was appointed to be a priest, not on the basis of a regulation concerning his ancestry, but rather on the basis of the power of an indestructible life."
58,7,17,"For it is declared about him,	“You are a priest foreveraccording to the order of Melchizedek.”"
58,7,18,"Indeed, the cancellation of the former regulation has occurred because it was weak and ineffective"
58,7,19,"(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we approach God."
58,7,20,"Now none of this happened without an oath. Others became priests without any oath,"
58,7,21,"but Jesus became a priest with an oath when God said to him,	“The Lord has taken an oathand will not change his mind.	You are a priest forever.”"
58,7,22,"In this way, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant."
58,7,23,"There have been many priests, since they have been prevented by death from continuing in office."
58,7,24,"But because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood."
58,7,25,"Therefore, because he always lives to intercede for them, he is able to save completely those who come to God through him."
58,7,26,"We need such a high priest—one who is holy, innocent, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens."
58,7,27,"He has no need to offer sacrifices every day like those high priests, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he sacrificed himself."
58,7,28,"For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever."
58,8,1,"Now the main point in what we are saying is this: we do have this kind of high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven"
58,8,2,"and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord and not by any human."
58,8,3,"For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore, this high priest had to offer something too."
58,8,4,"Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because other men offer the gifts prescribed by the law."
58,8,5,"They serve in a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly one. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.”"
58,8,6,"However, Jesus has now obtained a ministry that is as superior to theirs as the covenant he mediates is founded on better promises."
58,8,7,"For if the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one."
58,8,8,"But God found something wrong with his people when he said,	“Look! The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will establish a new covenantwith the house of Israeland with the house of Judah."
58,8,9,"It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors at the timewhen I took them by the handand brought them out of the land of Egypt. 	Because they did not remain loyal to my covenant,I ignored them, declares the Lord."
58,8,10,"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israelafter those days, declares the Lord:	I will put my laws in their mindsand write them on their hearts.	I will be their God,and they will be my people."
58,8,11,"Never again will everyone teach his neighbor or his brother by saying, ‘Know the Lord,’	because all of them will know me,from the least important to the most important."
58,8,12,"For I will be merciful regarding their wrong deeds,and I will never again remember their sins.”"
58,8,13,"In speaking of a “new” covenant, he has made the first one obsolete, and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear."
58,9,1,"Now even first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary."
58,9,2,"For a tabernacle was set up, and in the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the Presence. This was called the Holy Place."
58,9,3,"Behind the second curtain was the part of the tabernacle called the Holy of Holies,"
58,9,4,"which had the gold altar for incense and the ark of the covenant completely covered with gold. In it were the gold jar holding the manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the tablets of the covenant."
58,9,5,"Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of atonement. (We cannot discuss these things in detail now.)"
58,9,6,"When everything had been arranged like this, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle to perform their duties."
58,9,7,"But only the high priest went into the second part, and then only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins committed by the people in ignorance."
58,9,8,"The Holy Spirit was indicating by this that the way into the Holy of Holies had not yet been disclosed as long as the first part of the tabernacle was still standing."
58,9,9,"This is an illustration of the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered could not make the conscience of the worshiper perfect,"
58,9,10,"since they deal only with food, drink, and various washings, which are required for the body until the time when things would be set right."
58,9,11,"But when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that was not made by human hands and that is not a part of this creation."
58,9,12,"Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood he went into the Holy of Holies once for all and secured our eternal redemption."
58,9,13,"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are unclean purifies them with physical cleansing,"
58,9,14,"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works so that we may serve the living God!"
58,9,15,"This is why he is the mediator of a new covenant; so that those who are called may receive the eternal inheritance promised them, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the offenses committed under the first covenant."
58,9,16,"For where there is a will, the death of the one who made it must be established."
58,9,17,"For a will is in force only when somebody has died, since it never takes effect as long as the one who made it is alive."
58,9,18,"This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood."
58,9,19,"For after every commandment in the law had been spoken to all the people by Moses, he took the blood of calves and goats, together with some water, scarlet wool, and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people,"
58,9,20,"saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God ordained for you.”"
58,9,21,"In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in worship."
58,9,22,"In fact, under the law almost everything is cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of the blood there is no forgiveness."
58,9,23,"Thus it was necessary for the copies of the things in heaven to be cleansed by these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
58,9,24,"For Christ did not go into a sanctuary made by human hands and just a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in God's presence on our behalf."
58,9,25,"Nor did he go into heaven to sacrifice himself again and again, the way the high priest goes into the Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own."
58,9,26,"Then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now, at the end of the ages, he has appeared once for all to remove sin by his sacrifice."
58,9,27,"Indeed, just as people are appointed to die once and after that to be judged,"
58,9,28,"so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people. And he will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly wait for him."
58,10,1,"For the law, being only a reflection of the blessings to come and not their substance, can never, by the same sacrifices repeatedly offered year after year, make those who come near perfect."
58,10,2,"Otherwise, would they not have stopped offering them, because the worshipers, cleansed once for all, would no longer be aware of any sins?"
58,10,3,"Instead, through those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year,"
58,10,4,"for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins."
58,10,5,"For this reason, when Christ came into the world, he said,	“You did not want sacrifices and offerings,but you prepared a body for me."
58,10,6,"In burnt offerings and sin offeringsyou never took delight."
58,10,7,"Then I said, ‘See, I have come to do your will, O God’(in the scroll of the Book this is written about me).”"
58,10,8,"In this passage he says, “You never wanted or took delight in sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sin offerings,” which are offered according to the law."
58,10,9,"Then he says, “See, I have come to do your will.” He takes away the first in order to establish the second."
58,10,10,"By his will we have been sanctified once for all through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ."
58,10,11,"Day after day every priest stands and repeatedly offers the same sacrifices that can never take away sins."
58,10,12,"But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, “he sat down at the right hand of God.”"
58,10,13,"Since that time, he has been waiting for his enemies to be made a footstool for his feet."
58,10,14,"For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified."
58,10,15,"The Holy Spirit also assures us of this. For he said,"
58,10,16,"“This is the covenant that I will make with themafter those days, declares the Lord:	I will put my laws in their heartsand will write them on their minds,”"
58,10,17,"and,	“I will never again remember their sinsand their lawless deeds.”"
58,10,18,"Now where there is forgiveness of these sins, there is no longer any offering for sin."
58,10,19,"Therefore, my brothers, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,"
58,10,20,"the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh),"
58,10,21,"and since we have a great high priest over the household of God,"
58,10,22,"let us continue to come near with sincere hearts in full assurance of faith, because our hearts have been sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies have been washed with pure water."
58,10,23,"Let us continue to hold firmly to the hope that we confess without wavering, for the one who made the promise is faithful."
58,10,24,"And let us continue to consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,"
58,10,25,"not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another even more as you see the day coming nearer."
58,10,26,"For if we choose to go on sinning after we have received the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,"
58,10,27,"but only a terrifying prospect of judgment and a raging fire that will consume the enemies of God"
58,10,28,"Anyone who violates the law of Moses dies without mercy “on the testimony of two or three witnesses.”"
58,10,29,"How much more severe a punishment do you think that person deserves who tramples on God's Son, treats as common the blood of the covenant by which it was sanctified, and insults the Spirit of grace?"
58,10,30,"For we know the one who said, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will pay them back,” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”"
58,10,31,"It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!"
58,10,32,"But you must continue to remember those earlier days, how after you were enlightened you endured a hard and painful struggle."
58,10,33,"At times you were made a public spectacle through insults and persecutions, while at other times you associated with people who were treated this way."
58,10,34,"For you sympathized with the prisoners and cheerfully submitted to the violent seizure of your property, because you know that you have a better and more permanent possession."
58,10,35,"So do not throw away your confidence, since it holds a great reward for you."
58,10,36,"For you need endurance, so that after you have done God's will you can receive what he has promised."
58,10,37,"For	“in a very little whilethe one who is coming will returnand will not delay;"
58,10,38,"but my righteous one will live by faith,and if he turns back,my soul will take no pleasure in him.”"
58,10,39,"Now, we do not belong to those who turn back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved."
58,11,1,"Now faith is the assurance of things we hope for, the certainty of things we cannot see."
58,11,2,"For by it our ancestors won approval."
58,11,3,"By faith we understand that the universe was prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are invisible."
58,11,4,"By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain did, and by it he was declared to be righteous, since God himself accepted his offerings. And by faith he continues to speak, even though he is dead."
58,11,5,"By faith Enoch was taken away without experiencing death. He could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he won approval as one who pleased God."
58,11,6,"Now without faith it is impossible to please God, for the one who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who diligently search for him."
58,11,7,"By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, reverently prepared an ark to save his family, and by it he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith."
58,11,8,"By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going."
58,11,9,"By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise."
58,11,10,"For he was waiting for the city with permanent foundations, whose architect and builder is God."
58,11,11,"By faith Sarah, even though she was old and barren, received the strength to conceive, because she was convinced that the one who had made the promise was faithful."
58,11,12,"Abraham was as good as dead, yet from this one man came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore."
58,11,13,"All these people died having faith. They did not receive the things that were promised, yet they saw them in the distant future and welcomed them, acknowledging that they were strangers and foreigners on earth."
58,11,14,"For people who say such things make it clear that they are looking for a country of their own."
58,11,15,"If they had been thinking about what they had left behind, they would have had an opportunity to go back."
58,11,16,"Instead, they were longing for a better country, that is, a heavenly one. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, because he has prepared a city for them."
58,11,17,"By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac. The man who had received the promises was about to offer his unique son,"
58,11,18,"about whom it had been said, “It is through Isaac that descendants will be named for you.”"
58,11,19,"He was certain that God could raise people from the dead, and figuratively speaking he did get him back in this way."
58,11,20,"By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future."
58,11,21,"By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons “and worshiped while leaning on the top of his staff.”"
58,11,22,"By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites and gave them instructions about burying his bones."
58,11,23,"By faith Moses was hidden by his parents for three months after he was born, because they saw that he was a beautiful child and were not afraid of the king's order."
58,11,24,"By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter,"
58,11,25,"because he preferred being mistreated with God's people to enjoying the pleasures of sin for a short time."
58,11,26,"He thought that being insulted for the sake of Christ was of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward."
58,11,27,"By faith he left Egypt, without being afraid of the king's anger, and he persevered because he saw the one who is invisible."
58,11,28,"By faith he established the Passover and the sprinkling of blood to keep the destroyer of the firstborn from touching the people."
58,11,29,"By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it were dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do this, they were drowned."
58,11,30,"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days."
58,11,31,"By faith Rahab the prostitute did not die with those who were disobedient, because she had welcomed the spies with a greeting of peace."
58,11,32,"And what more should I say? For time would fail me to tell you about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets."
58,11,33,"Through faith they conquered kingdoms, administered justice, received promises, shut the mouths of lions,"
58,11,34,"put out raging fires, escaped death by the sword, found strength in weakness, became powerful in battle, and routed foreign armies."
58,11,35,"Women received back their dead through a resurrection. Others were brutally tortured but refused to accept release, so that they might gain a better resurrection."
58,11,36,"Still others endured taunts and floggings, and even chains and imprisonment."
58,11,37,"They were stoned to death, sawed in half, and killed with swords. They went around in sheepskins and goatskins. They were needy, oppressed, and mistreated."
58,11,38,"The world wasn’t worthy of them. They wandered in deserts, mountains, caves, and holes in the ground."
58,11,39,"All these people won approval for their faith but did not receive what was promised,"
58,11,40,"since God had planned something better for us so that they would not become perfect without us."
58,12,1,"Therefore, having so vast a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, and throwing off everything that hinders us and especially the sin that so easily entangles us, let us keep running with endurance the race set before us,"
58,12,2,"looking off to Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of the faith, who, in view of the joy set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
58,12,3,"Think about the one who endured such hostility from sinners, so that you may not become tired and give up."
58,12,4,"In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood."
58,12,5,"You have forgotten the encouragement that is addressed to you as sons:	“My son, do not think lightly of the Lord's disciplineor give up when you are corrected by him."
58,12,6,"For the Lord disciplines the one he loves,and he punishes every son he accepts.”"
58,12,7,"What you endure is for the sake of discipline. God is treating you as sons. Is there a son whom his father does not discipline?"
58,12,8,"Now if you are without any discipline, in which all sons share, then you are illegitimate and not his sons."
58,12,9,"Furthermore, we had earthly fathers who used to discipline us, and we respected them for it. We should even more submit to the Father of our spirits and live, shouldn't we?"
58,12,10,"For a short time they disciplined us as they thought best, but he does it for our good, so that we may share in his holiness."
58,12,11,"No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, for those who have been trained by it, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace."
58,12,12,"Therefore, strengthen your tired arms and your weak knees,"
58,12,13,"and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not become worse but rather be healed."
58,12,14,"Pursue peace with everyone, as well as holiness, without which no one will see the Lord."
58,12,15,"See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up and causes you trouble, or many of you will become defiled."
58,12,16,"No one should be immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal."
58,12,17,"For you know that afterwards, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected because he could not find any opportunity to repent, even though he begged for it with tears."
58,12,18,"For you have not come to something that can be touched, to a blazing fire, to darkness, to gloom,"
58,12,19,"to a trumpet's blast, or to a voice that made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them."
58,12,20,"For they could not endure the command that was given: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death.”"
58,12,21,"Indeed, the sight was so terrifying that Moses said, “I am trembling with fear.”"
58,12,22,"Instead, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, to tens of thousands of angels joyfully gathered together,"
58,12,23,"to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to a judge who is the God of all, to the spirits of righteous people who have been made perfect,"
58,12,24,"to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better message than Abel's."
58,12,25,"See to it that you do not ignore the one who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they ignored the one who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we turn away from the one who is from heaven!"
58,12,26,"At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven.”"
58,12,27,"The expression “once more” signifies the removal of what can be shaken, that is, what he has made, so that what cannot be shaken may remain."
58,12,28,"Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful and worship God in reverence and fear in a way that pleases him."
58,12,29,"For our God is an all-consuming fire."
58,13,1,"Let brotherly love continue."
58,13,2,"Stop neglecting to show hospitality to strangers, for by showing hospitality some have had angels as their guests without being aware of it."
58,13,3,"Continue to remember those in prison as if you were in prison with them, as well as those who are mistreated, since they also are only mortal."
58,13,4,"Let marriage be kept honorable in every way, and the marriage bed undefiled. For God will judge those who commit sexual sins, especially those who commit adultery."
58,13,5,"Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be content with what you have, for God has said, “I will never leave you or abandon you.”"
58,13,6,"Hence we can confidently say, “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me?”"
58,13,7,"Remember your leaders, those who have spoken God's word to you. Think about the impact of their lives, and imitate their faith."
58,13,8,"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today—and forever!"
58,13,9,"Stop being carried away by all kinds of unusual teachings, for it is good that the heart be strengthened by grace, not by food laws that have never helped those who follow them."
58,13,10,"We have an altar, and those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat at it."
58,13,11,"For the bodies of animals, whose blood is taken into the sanctuary by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp."
58,13,12,"That is why Jesus, in order to sanctify the people by his own blood, also suffered outside the city gate."
58,13,13,"Therefore go to him outside the camp and endure the insults he endured."
58,13,14,"For here we have no permanent city but are looking for the one that is coming."
58,13,15,"Therefore, through him let us always bring God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name."
58,13,16,"Do not neglect to do good and to be generous, for God is pleased with such sacrifices."
58,13,17,"Continue to obey your leaders and to be submissive to them, for they watch over your souls as men who will have to give a word of explanation. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for that would be harmful to you."
58,13,18,"Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way."
58,13,19,"I especially ask you to do this so that I may be brought back to you sooner."
58,13,20,"Now may the God of peace, who by the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, the Great Shepherd of the sheep,"
58,13,21,"equip you with everything good to do his will, accomplishing in us what pleases him through Jesus Christ. To him be glory forever and ever! Amen."
58,13,22,"I urge you, brothers, to listen patiently to my encouraging message, for I have written you a short letter."
58,13,23,"You should know that our brother Timothy has been set free. If he comes soon, he will be with me when I see you."
58,13,24,"Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who are from Italy greet you."
58,13,25,"May grace be with all of you!"
59,1,1,"From James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion. Greetings."
59,1,2,"Consider it pure joy, my brothers, when you are involved in various trials,"
59,1,3,"because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance."
59,1,4,"But you must let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing."
59,1,5,"Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to everyone generously without a rebuke, and it will be given to him."
59,1,6,"But he must ask in faith, without any doubts, for the one who has doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind."
59,1,7,"Such a person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord."
59,1,8,"He is a double-minded man, unstable in all he undertakes."
59,1,9,"A brother of low status should boast in his exalted status,"
59,1,10,"and a rich person in his lowliness, because he will fade away like a flower in the grass."
59,1,11,"For the sun comes up with its scorching heat and dries up the grass. The flower in it drops off, and its beauty is gone. That is how the rich person will fade away in his pursuits."
59,1,12,"How blessed is the man who endures temptation! When he has passed the test, he will receive the victor's crown of life that God has promised to those who keep on loving him."
59,1,13,"When someone is tempted, he should not say, “I am being tempted by God,” because God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone."
59,1,14,"Instead, each person is tempted by his own desire, being lured and trapped by it."
59,1,15,"When that desire becomes pregnant, it gives birth to sin; when that sin grows up, it gives birth to death."
59,1,16,"Do not be deceived, my dear brothers."
59,1,17,"Every generous act of giving and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father who made the heavenly lights, in whom there is no inconsistency or shifting shadow."
59,1,18,"In accordance with his will he made us his children by the word of truth, so that we might become the most important of his creatures."
59,1,19,"You must understand this, my dear brothers. Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry."
59,1,20,"For human anger does not produce God's righteousness."
59,1,21,"Therefore, rid yourselves of everything impure and every expression of wickedness, and with a gentle spirit welcome the word planted in you that can save your souls."
59,1,22,"Keep on being doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves."
59,1,23,"For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at himself in a mirror."
59,1,24,"For he studies himself carefully and then goes off and immediately forgets what he looks like."
59,1,25,"But the one who looks at the perfect law of freedom and remains committed to it—thus proving that he is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of what it requires—will be blessed in what he does."
59,1,26,"If anyone thinks that he is religious and does not bridle his tongue, but instead deceives his own heart, his religion is worthless."
59,1,27,"A religion that is pure and stainless in the sight of God the Father is this: to take care of orphans and widows in their suffering, and to keep oneself unstained by the world."
59,2,1,"My brothers, do not practice your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ by showing partiality."
59,2,2,"Suppose a man wearing gold rings and fine clothes comes into your assembly, and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in."
59,2,3,"If you give special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Please take this seat,” but you say to the poor man, “Stand over there” or “Sit on the floor at my feet,”"
59,2,4,"you have made false distinctions among yourselves and have become judges with evil motives, haven't you?"
59,2,5,"Listen, my dear brothers! God has chosen the poor in the world to become rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him, has he not?"
59,2,6,"But you have humiliated the man who is poor. Are not rich people the ones who oppress you and drag you into court?"
59,2,7,"Are not they the ones who blaspheme the excellent name by which you have been called?"
59,2,8,"Nevertheless, you are doing the right thing if you obey the royal law in keeping with the Scripture, “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”"
59,2,9,"But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and will be convicted by the law as violators."
59,2,10,"For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point is guilty of breaking all of it."
59,2,11,"For the one who said, “Never commit adultery,” also said, “Never murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but you murder, you become a violator of the law."
59,2,12,"You must make it your habit to speak and act like people who are going to be judged by the law of liberty."
59,2,13,"For merciless judgment will come to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment."
59,2,14,"What good does it do, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith but does not have any works? This kind of faith cannot save him, can it?"
59,2,15,"Suppose a brother or sister does not have any clothes or daily food"
59,2,16,"and one of you tells them, “Go in peace! Stay warm and eat heartily.” If you do not provide for their bodily needs, what good does it do?"
59,2,17,"In the same way, faith by itself, if it does not have any works, is dead."
59,2,18,"But someone may say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without any works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
59,2,19,"You believe that there is one God. That's fine! Even the demons believe that and tremble with fear."
59,2,20,"Do you want proof, you foolish person, that faith without works is worthless?"
59,2,21,"Our ancestor Abraham was justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar, wasn't he?"
59,2,22,"You see that his faith was active with his works, and by his works faith was made complete."
59,2,23,"And so the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” And so he was called God's friend."
59,2,24,"You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone."
59,2,25,"Likewise, Rahab the prostitute was justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them away on a different road, wasn't she?"
59,2,26,"For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead."
59,3,1,"Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more severely."
59,3,2,"For all of us make many mistakes. If someone does not make any mistakes when he speaks, he is perfect and able to control his whole body."
59,3,3,"Now if we put bits into horses’ mouths to make them obey us, we can guide their whole bodies as well."
59,3,4,"And look at ships! They are so big that it takes strong winds to drive them, yet they are steered wherever the pilot pleases by a tiny rudder."
59,3,5,"In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it can boast of great achievements. A huge forest can be set on fire by a little flame."
59,3,6,"The tongue is a fire, a world of evil. Placed among the parts of our bodies, the tongue contaminates the whole body and sets on fire the course of life, and is itself set on fire by hell."
59,3,7,"For all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures can be or have been tamed by the human species,"
59,3,8,"but no one can tame the tongue. It is an uncontrollable evil filled with deadly poison."
59,3,9,"With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in God's likeness."
59,3,10,"From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. It should not be like this, my brothers!"
59,3,11,"A spring cannot pour both fresh and brackish water from the same opening, can it?"
59,3,12,"My brothers, a fig tree cannot produce olives, nor a grapevine figs, can it? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water."
59,3,13,"Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good life that his works are done in humility born of wisdom."
59,3,14,"But if you have bitter jealousy and rivalry in your hearts, stop boasting and lying against the truth."
59,3,15,"That kind of wisdom does not come from above. No, it is worldly, self-centered, and demonic."
59,3,16,"For wherever jealousy and rivalry exist, there is disorder and every kind of evil."
59,3,17,"However, the wisdom that comes from above is first of all pure, then peace-loving, gentle, willing to yield, full of compassion and good fruits, and without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy."
59,3,18,"And a harvest of righteousness is grown from the seed of peace planted by peacemakers."
59,4,1,"Where do those fights and quarrels among you come from? They come from your selfish desires that are at war in your bodies, don't they?"
59,4,2,"You want something but do not get it, so you commit murder. You covet something but cannot obtain it, so you quarrel and fight. You do not get things because you do not ask for them!"
59,4,3,"You ask for something but do not get it because you ask for it for the wrong reason—for your own pleasure."
59,4,4,"You adulterers! Don't you know that friendship with the world means hostility with God? So whoever wants to be a friend of this world is an enemy of God."
59,4,5,"Or do you think the Scripture means nothing when it says that the Spirit that God caused to live in us jealously yearns for us?"
59,4,6,"But he gives all the more grace. And so he says,	“God opposes the arrogantbut gives grace to the humble.”"
59,4,7,"Therefore, submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you."
59,4,8,"Come close to God, and he will come close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded."
59,4,9,"Be miserable, mourn, and cry. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into gloom."
59,4,10,"Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you."
59,4,11,"Do not criticize each other, brothers. Whoever makes it his habit to criticize his brother or to judge his brother is judging the law and condemning the law. But if you condemn the law, you are not a doer of the law but its judge."
59,4,12,"There is only one Lawgiver and Judge—the one who can save and destroy. So who are you to judge your neighbor?"
59,4,13,"Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town, stay there a year, conduct business, and make money.”"
59,4,14,"You do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes."
59,4,15,"Instead you should say, “If the Lord wants us to, we will live—and do this or that.”"
59,4,16,"But you boast about your proud intentions. All such boasting is evil."
59,4,17,"Therefore, anyone who knows what is right but fails to do it is guilty of sin."
59,5,1,"Now listen, you rich people! Cry and moan over the miseries that are overtaking you."
59,5,2,"Your riches are rotten, your clothes have been eaten by moths,"
59,5,3,"your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be used as evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up treasures in these last days."
59,5,4,"Look! The wages that you kept back from the workers who harvested your fields are shouting out against you, and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies."
59,5,5,"You have lived in luxury and pleasure on earth. You have fattened your hearts for the day of slaughter."
59,5,6,"You have condemned and murdered the one who is righteous, even though he did not resist you."
59,5,7,"So be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious crop from his land, being patient with it until it receives the fall and the spring rains."
59,5,8,"You, too, must be patient. Strengthen your hearts, because the coming of the Lord is near."
59,5,9,"Do not complain about each other, brothers, or you will be condemned. Look! The Judge is standing at the door!"
59,5,10,"As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord."
59,5,11,"We consider those who endured to be blessed. You have heard about Job's endurance and have seen the purpose of the Lord—that the Lord is compassionate and merciful."
59,5,12,"Above all, brothers, do not swear oaths by heaven, by earth, or by any other object. Instead, let your “Yes” mean yes and your “No” mean no, lest you fall under condemnation."
59,5,13,"Is anyone of you suffering? He should keep on praying. Is anyone cheerful? He should keep on singing psalms."
59,5,14,"Is anyone of you sick? He should call for the elders of the church, and they should pray for him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord."
59,5,15,"And the prayer offered in faith will save the person who is sick. The Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed any sins, he will be forgiven."
59,5,16,"Therefore, make it your habit to confess your sins to one another and to pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective."
59,5,17,"Elijah was a man just like us, and he prayed earnestly for it not to rain, and it did not rain on the ground for three years and six months."
59,5,18,"Then he prayed again, and heaven sent rain, and the ground produced its crops."
59,5,19,"My brothers, if one of you wanders away from the truth and somebody brings him back,"
59,5,20,"you may be sure that whoever brings a sinner back from his wrong path will save his soul from death and cover a multitude of sins."
60,1,1,"From Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
60,1,2,"the people chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through the sanctifying work of the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ and to be sprinkled with his blood. May grace and peace be yours in abundance!"
60,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! Because of his great mercy he has given us a new birth to an ever-living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead"
60,1,4,"and to an inheritance kept in heaven for you that can't be destroyed, corrupted, or changed."
60,1,5,"Through faith you are being protected by God's power for a salvation that is ready to be revealed at the end of time."
60,1,6,"In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you have to suffer various kinds of trials,"
60,1,7,"so that the genuineness of your faith, which is more valuable than gold that perishes when it is tested by fire, may result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed."
60,1,8,"Though you have not seen him, you love him. And even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy,"
60,1,9,"because you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls."
60,1,10,"Even the prophets, who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours, carefully researched and investigated this salvation."
60,1,11,"They tried to find out what era or specific time the Spirit of Christ in them kept referring to when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow."
60,1,12,"It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you in regard to the things that have now been announced to you by those who brought you the good news through the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. These are things that even the angels desire to look into."
60,1,13,"Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep a clear head, and set your hope completely on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed."
60,1,14,"As obedient children, do not be shaped by the desires that you once had in your ignorance."
60,1,15,"Instead, just as the one who called you is holy, be holy in every aspect of your life."
60,1,16,"For it is written, “You must be holy, because I am holy.”"
60,1,17,"If you call “Father” the one who judges everyone impartially according to what he has done, you must live in the fear of the Lord as long as you are strangers here."
60,1,18,"For you know that it was not with perishable things like silver or gold that you have been ransomed from the worthless way of life handed down to you by your ancestors,"
60,1,19,"but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or defect."
60,1,20,"On the one hand, he was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but on the other hand, he was revealed at the end of time for your sake."
60,1,21,"Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God."
60,1,22,"Now that you have obeyed the truth and have purified your souls to love your brothers sincerely, you must love one another intensely and with a pure heart."
60,1,23,"For you have been born again, not by a seed that perishes but by one that cannot perish—by the living and everlasting word of God."
60,1,24,"For	“All human life is like grass,and all its glory is like a flower in the grass.	The grass dries up and the flower drops off,"
60,1,25,"but the word of the Lord lasts forever.”Now this word is the good news that was announced to you."
60,2,1,"Therefore, rid yourselves of every kind of evil and deception, hypocrisy, jealousy, and every kind of slander."
60,2,2,"Like newborn babies, thirst for the pure milk of the word so that by it you may grow in your salvation."
60,2,3,"Surely you have tasted that the Lord is good!"
60,2,4,"As you come to him, the living stone who was rejected by people but was chosen and precious in God's sight,"
60,2,5,"you, too, as living stones, are building yourselves up into a spiritual house and a holy priesthood, so that you may offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
60,2,6,"This is why it says in Scripture:	“Look! I am laying a chosenand precious cornerstone in Zion.			The one who believes in him will never be ashamed.”"
60,2,7,"Therefore he is precious to you who believe, but to those who do not believe,	“The stone that the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone,"
60,2,8,"a stone they stumble over and a rock they trip on.”They keep on stumbling because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do."
60,2,9,"But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people to be his very own and to proclaim the wonderful deeds of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light."
60,2,10,"Once you were not a people,but now you are the people of God.	Once you had not received mercy,but now you have received mercy."
60,2,11,"Dear friends, I urge you as aliens and exiles to keep on abstaining from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul."
60,2,12,"Continue to live such upright lives among the Gentiles that, when they slander you as evildoers, they may see your good works and glorify God when he visits them in judgment."
60,2,13,"For the Lord's sake submit yourselves to every human authority: whether to the king as supreme,"
60,2,14,"or to governors who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right."
60,2,15,"For it is God's will that by doing right you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people."
60,2,16,"Live like free people, and do not use your freedom as an excuse for doing evil. Instead, be God's servants."
60,2,17,"Show honor to everyone. Keep on loving the brothers, fearing God, and honoring the king."
60,2,18,"You household servants must submit yourselves to your masters with all fear, not only to those who are kind and fair, but also to those who are unjust."
60,2,19,"For it is a fine thing if, when moved by your conscience to please God, you suffer patiently when wronged."
60,2,20,"What credit is it if you sin and patiently receive a beating for it? But if you suffer for doing good and take it patiently, you have God's approval."
60,2,21,"This is, in fact, what you were called to do, because Christ also suffered for you and left an example for you to follow in his steps."
60,2,22,"“He never committed a sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.”"
60,2,23,"When he was insulted, he did not retaliate. When he suffered, he did not threaten but made it his habit to commit the matter to the one who judges fairly."
60,2,24,"He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to those sins and live for righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed."
60,2,25,"For you were like sheep that kept going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls."
60,3,1,"In a similar way, you wives must submit yourselves to your husbands so that, even if some of them refuse to obey the word, they may be won over without a word through your conduct as wives"
60,3,2,"when they see your pure and reverent lives."
60,3,3,"Your beauty should not be an external one, consisting of braided hair or the wearing of gold ornaments and dresses."
60,3,4,"Instead, it should be the inner disposition of the heart, consisting in the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great value in the sight of God."
60,3,5,"After all, this is how holy women who set their hope on God used to make themselves beautiful in the past. They submitted themselves to their husbands,"
60,3,6,"just as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. You have become her daughters by doing good and by not letting anything terrify you."
60,3,7,"In a similar way, you husbands must live with your wives in an understanding manner, as with a most delicate vessel. Honor them as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing may interfere with your prayers."
60,3,8,"Finally, all of you must live in harmony, be sympathetic, love as brothers, and be compassionate and humble."
60,3,9,"Do not pay others back evil for evil or insult for insult. Instead, bless them, because you were called to inherit a blessing."
60,3,10,"For	“the person who wants to love lifeand see good days	must keep his tongue from eviland his lips from speaking deceit."
60,3,11,"He must turn away from evil and do good.He must seek peace and pursue it."
60,3,12,"For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,and his ears are attentive to their prayer.	But the face of the Lord is against those who do wrong.”"
60,3,13,"Who will harm you if you are devoted to doing what is good?"
60,3,14,"But even if you should suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. Never be afraid of their threats, and never get upset."
60,3,15,"Instead, exalt Christ as Lord in your hearts. Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you to explain the hope you have."
60,3,16,"But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak evil of your good conduct in Christ will be ashamed of slandering you."
60,3,17,"After all, if it is the will of God, it is better to suffer for doing right than for doing wrong."
60,3,18,"For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, an innocent person for the guilty, so that he could bring you to God. He was put to death in the sphere of the flesh but was made alive in the sphere of the spirit,"
60,3,19,"in which he went and made a proclamation to those imprisoned spirits"
60,3,20,"who disobeyed long ago in the days of Noah, when God waited patiently while the ark was being built. In it a few, that is, eight persons, were saved by water."
60,3,21,"Baptism, which is symbolized by that water, now saves you also, not by removing dirt from the body, but by asking God for a clear conscience based on the resurrection of Jesus Christ,"
60,3,22,"who has gone to heaven and is at the right hand of God, where angels, authorities, and powers have been made subject to him."
60,4,1,"Therefore, since Christ suffered in the sphere of the flesh, you, too, must arm yourselves with the same determination. For the person who has suffered in the sphere of the flesh has stopped sinning,"
60,4,2,"so that he can live the rest of his time in the flesh guided, not by human desires, but by the will of God."
60,4,3,"For you spent enough time in the past doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in sensuality, sinful desires, drunkenness, wild celebrations, drinking parties, and detestable idolatry."
60,4,4,"They insult you now because they are surprised that you are no longer joining them in the same excesses of wild living."
60,4,5,"They will give an account to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead."
60,4,6,"Indeed, this is why the gospel was proclaimed even to those who have died, so that they could be judged in the realm of the flesh like all humans and live in the realm of the spirit like God."
60,4,7,"The end of everything is near; so be sensible and clear-headed for the sake of your prayers."
60,4,8,"Above all, continue to love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins."
60,4,9,"Show hospitality to one another without complaining."
60,4,10,"As good managers of God's grace in its various forms, serve one another with the gift each of you has received."
60,4,11,"Whoever speaks must speak God's words. Whoever serves must serve with the strength that God supplies, so that in every way God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. Glory and power belong to him forever and ever! Amen."
60,4,12,"Dear friends, do not be surprised by the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you."
60,4,13,"Instead, because you are participating in the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that you may be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed."
60,4,14,"If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the glorious Spirit of God is resting on you."
60,4,15,"Of course, none of you should suffer for being a murderer, thief, criminal, or troublemaker."
60,4,16,"But if you suffer for being a Christian, do not feel ashamed, but glorify God with that name."
60,4,17,"For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God. And if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who refuse to obey the gospel of God?"
60,4,18,"“If it is hard for the righteous person to be saved,what will happen to the ungodly and sinful person?”"
60,4,19,"So then, those who suffer according to God's will should entrust their souls to a faithful Creator and continue to do what is good."
60,5,1,"Therefore, as a fellow elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings, and one who shares in the glory to be revealed, I appeal to the elders among you:"
60,5,2,"Be shepherds of God's flock that is among you, watching over it, not because you must but because you want to, and not greedily but eagerly, as God desires."
60,5,3,"Do not lord it over the people entrusted to you, but be examples to the flock."
60,5,4,"Then, when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the victor's crown of glory that will never fade away."
60,5,5,"In a similar way, you young people must be submissive to the elders. All of you must put on the apron of humility before one another, because	“God opposes the arrogant,but gives grace to the humble.”"
60,5,6,"Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time he may exalt you."
60,5,7,"Throw all your worry on him, because he cares for you."
60,5,8,"Be clear-minded and alert. Your opponent the devil is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour."
60,5,9,"Resist him and be firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering."
60,5,10,"After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you in Christ Jesus to his eternal glory, will restore you, establish you, strengthen you, and support you."
60,5,11,"Power belongs to him forever and ever! Amen."
60,5,12,"Through Silvanus, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written this short letter to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!"
60,5,13,"Your sister church in Babylon, chosen along with you, sends you greetings, as does my son Mark."
60,5,14,"Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to all of you who are in Christ!"
61,1,1,"From Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a faith that is as valuable as ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ."
61,1,2,"May grace and peace be yours in abundance through the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord!"
61,1,3,"His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through the full knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence."
61,1,4,"Through these he has given us his precious and wonderful promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, seeing that you have escaped the corruption that is in the world caused by evil desires."
61,1,5,"For this very reason, you must make every effort to supplement your faith with moral character, your moral character with knowledge,"
61,1,6,"your knowledge with self-control, your self-control with endurance, your endurance with godliness,"
61,1,7,"your godliness with brotherly kindness, and your brotherly kindness with love."
61,1,8,"For if you possess these qualities, and if they continue to increase among you, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in attaining a full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
61,1,9,"For the person who lacks these qualities is blind and shortsighted, and has forgotten the cleansing that he has received from his past sins."
61,1,10,"So then, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election certain, for if you keep on doing this you will never fail."
61,1,11,"For in this way you will be generously granted entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
61,1,12,"Therefore, I intend to keep on reminding you about these things, even though you already know them and are firmly established in the truth that you now have."
61,1,13,"Yet I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I am living in this bodily tent,"
61,1,14,"because I know that the removal of my bodily tent will come soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me."
61,1,15,"And I will make every effort to see that you will always remember these things after I am gone."
61,1,16,"When we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, we did not follow any clever myths. Rather, we were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
61,1,17,"For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice of the Majestic Glory was conveyed to him as follows: “This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him.”"
61,1,18,"We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain."
61,1,19,"Thus we regard the message of the prophets as confirmed beyond doubt, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp that is shining in a gloomy place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts."
61,1,20,"First of all, you must understand this: No prophecy in Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,"
61,1,21,"because no prophecy ever originated through a human decision. Instead, men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."
61,2,1,"Now there were false prophets among the people, just as there also will be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies and even deny the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction on themselves."
61,2,2,"Many people will follow their immoral ways, and because of them the way of truth will be maligned."
61,2,3,"In their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. The ancient verdict against them is still in force, and their destruction is not asleep."
61,2,4,"For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but threw them into hell and committed them to chains of deepest darkness to be kept for judgment;"
61,2,5,"and if he did not spare the ancient world but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others when he brought the flood on the world of ungodly people;"
61,2,6,"and if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and destroyed them by burning them to ashes, making them an example to ungodly people of what is going to happen to them;"
61,2,7,"and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man who was greatly distressed by the immoral conduct of lawless people—"
61,2,8,"for as long as that righteous man lived among them, day after day he was being tortured in his righteous soul by what he saw and heard in their lawless actions—"
61,2,9,"then the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials and to hold unrighteous people for punishment on the day of judgment,"
61,2,10,"especially those who satisfy their flesh by indulging in its passions and who despise authority.Being bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to slander glorious beings."
61,2,11,"Yet even angels, although they are greater in strength and power, do not bring a slanderous accusation against them from the Lord."
61,2,12,"These people, like irrational animals, are mere creatures of instinct that are born to be caught and killed. They insult what they don't understand, and like animals they, too, will be destroyed,"
61,2,13,"suffering wrong as punishment for their wrongdoing. They take pleasure in wild parties in broad daylight. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceitful pleasures while they eat with you."
61,2,14,"With eyes full of adultery, they cannot get enough of sin. They seduce unsteady souls and have had their hearts expertly trained in greed. They are doomed to a curse."
61,2,15,"They have left the straight path and wandered off to follow the path of Balaam, the son of Bosor, who loved the reward he got for doing wrong."
61,2,16,"But he was rebuked for his offense. A donkey that normally cannot talk spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet's insanity."
61,2,17,"These men are dried-up springs, mere clouds driven by a storm. Gloomy darkness is reserved for them."
61,2,18,"By talking high-sounding nonsense and using sinful cravings of the flesh, they entice people who have just escaped from those who live in error."
61,2,19,"Promising them freedom, they themselves are slaves to depravity, for a person is a slave to whatever conquers him."
61,2,20,"For if, after escaping the world's corruptions through a full knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled and conquered by them, then their last condition is worse than their former one."
61,2,21,"It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to know it and turn their backs on the holy commandment that was committed to them."
61,2,22,"The proverb is true that describes what has happened to them: “A dog returns to its vomit,” and “A pig that is washed goes back to wallow in the mud.”"
61,3,1,"Dear friends, this is now the second letter I am writing to you. In them I have been trying to stimulate your pure minds by reminding you"
61,3,2,"to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the commandment of our Lord and Savior spoken through your apostles."
61,3,3,"First of all you must understand this: In the last days mockers will come and, following their own desires, will ridicule us"
61,3,4,"by saying, “What happened to his promise to return? Ever since our ancestors died, everything continues as it did from the beginning of creation.”"
61,3,5,"But they deliberately ignore the fact that long ago the heavens existed and the earth was formed by God's word out of water and with water,"
61,3,6,"by which the world at that time was deluged with water and destroyed."
61,3,7,"Now by the same word the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire and are being kept for the day when ungodly people will be judged and destroyed."
61,3,8,"Don't forget this fact, dear friends: With the Lord a single day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a single day."
61,3,9,"The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some people understand slowness, but is being patient with you. He does not want anyone to perish, but wants everyone to come to repentance."
61,3,10,"But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief. On that day the heavens will disappear with a roaring sound, the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done on it will be exposed."
61,3,11,"Since everything will be destroyed in this way, think of the kind of holy and godly people you ought to be"
61,3,12,"as you look forward to and hasten the coming of the day of God, by which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire."
61,3,13,"But in keeping with his promise, we are looking forward to new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness is at home."
61,3,14,"So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to have him find you without spot or fault and at peace."
61,3,15,"Think of our Lord's patience as salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him."
61,3,16,"He speaks about this subject in all his letters. Some things in them are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort to their own destruction, as they do the rest of the Scriptures."
61,3,17,"And so, dear friends, since you already know these things, continually be on your guard not to be carried away by the deception of lawless people, lest you fall from your secure position."
61,3,18,"Instead, continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Glory belongs to him both now and on that eternal day! Amen."
62,1,1,"What existed from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we observed and touched with our own hands—this is the Word of life!"
62,1,2,"This life was revealed to us, and we have seen it and testify about it. We declare to you this eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us."
62,1,3,"What we have seen and heard we declare to you so that you, too, can have fellowship with us. Now this fellowship of ours is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ."
62,1,4,"We are writing these things so that our joy may be full."
62,1,5,"This is the message that we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness—none at all!"
62,1,6,"If we claim that we have fellowship with him but keep living in the darkness, we are lying and the truth is not in us."
62,1,7,"But if we keep living in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin."
62,1,8,"If we say that we do not have any sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us."
62,1,9,"If we make it our habit to confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us those sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
62,1,10,"If we say that we have never sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us."
62,2,1,"My little children, I'm writing these things to you so that you might not sin. Yet if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, one who is righteous."
62,2,2,"It is he who is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world's."
62,2,3,"This is how we can be sure that we have come to know him: if we continually keep his commandments."
62,2,4,"The person who says, “I have come to know him,” but does not continually keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in that person."
62,2,5,"But whoever continually keeps his word is the kind of person in whom God's love has truly been perfected. This is how we can be sure that we are in union with him:"
62,2,6,"The one who says that he abides in him must live the same way he himself lived."
62,2,7,"Dear friends, I am not writing to you a new commandment, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word you have heard."
62,2,8,"On the other hand, I am writing to you a new commandment that is true in him and in you. For the darkness is fading away, and the true light is already shining."
62,2,9,"The person who says that he is in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness."
62,2,10,"The person who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no reason for him to stumble."
62,2,11,"But the person who hates his brother is in the darkness and lives in the darkness. He does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."
62,2,12,"I am writing to you, little children,because your sins have been forgivenon account of his name."
62,2,13,"I am writing to you, fathers,because you have known the one whohas existed from the beginning.	I am writing to you, young people,because you have overcome the evil one."
62,2,14,"I have written to you, little children,because you have known the Father.	I have written to you, fathers,because you have known the one whohas existed from the beginning.	I have written to you, young people,because you are strongand because God's word remains in youand you have overcome the evil one."
62,2,15,"Stop loving the world and the things that are in the world. If anyone persists in loving the world, the Father's love is not in him."
62,2,16,"For everything that is in the world—the desire for fleshly gratification, the desire for possessions, and worldly arrogance—is not from the Father but is from the world."
62,2,17,"And the world and its desires are fading away, but the person who does God's will remains forever."
62,2,18,"Little children, it is the last hour. Just as you heard that an antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have appeared. This is how we know it is the last hour."
62,2,19,"They left us, but they were not part of us, for if they had been part of us, they would have stayed with us. They simply made it clear that none of them was really part of us."
62,2,20,"You have an anointing from the Holy One and know all things."
62,2,21,"I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth."
62,2,22,"Who is a liar but the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ? The person who denies the Father and the Son is the antichrist."
62,2,23,"No one who denies the Son has the Father. The person who acknowledges the Son also has the Father."
62,2,24,"What you have heard from the beginning must abide in you. If what you have heard from the beginning abides in you, you will also abide in the Son and in the Father."
62,2,25,"The message that he himself declared to us is eternal life."
62,2,26,"I have written to you about those who are trying to deceive you."
62,2,27,"The anointing you received from him abides in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. Instead, because his anointing teaches you about everything and is true and not a lie, abide in him, as he taught you to do."
62,2,28,"Even now, little children, abide in him. Then, when he appears, we will have confidence and will not turn away from him in shame at his coming."
62,2,29,"If you know that he is righteous, you also know that everyone who practices righteousness has been born from God."
62,3,1,"See what kind of love the Father has given us in letting us be called God's children! Yet that is what we are. For this reason the world does not recognize us, because it did not recognize him either."
62,3,2,"Dear friends, we are now God's children, but what we will be like has not been revealed yet. We know that when Christ is revealed we will be like him, because we will see him as he is."
62,3,3,"And everyone who has this hope based on him keeps himself pure, just as he is pure."
62,3,4,"Everyone who keeps living in sin also practices disobedience. In fact, sin is disobedience."
62,3,5,"You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and there is not any sin in him."
62,3,6,"No one who remains in him goes on sinning. The one who goes on sinning hasn't seen him or known him."
62,3,7,"Little children, don't let anyone deceive you. The person who practices righteousness is righteous, just as he is righteous."
62,3,8,"The person who practices sin belongs to the evil one, because the devil has been sinning since the beginning. The reason that the Son of God was revealed was to destroy the works of the devil."
62,3,9,"No one who has been born from God practices sin, because God's seed abides in him. Indeed, he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born from God."
62,3,10,"This is how God's children and the devil's children are distinguished. No person who fails to practice righteousness and to love his brother is from God."
62,3,11,"This is the message that you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another."
62,3,12,"Do not be like Cain, who was from the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's were righteous."
62,3,13,"So do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you."
62,3,14,"We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love one another. The person who does not love remains in death."
62,3,15,"Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him."
62,3,16,"This is how we have come to know love: Christ gave his life for us. We, too, ought to give our lives for our brothers."
62,3,17,"Whoever has earthly possessions and notices a brother in need and yet withholds his compassion from him, how can the love of God remain in him?"
62,3,18,"Little children, we must stop loving in word and in tongue, but instead love in action and in truth."
62,3,19,"And this is how we will know that we belong to the truth and how we will be able to establish our hearts in his presence."
62,3,20,"If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts and knows everything."
62,3,21,"Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence in the presence of God."
62,3,22,"Whatever we request we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him."
62,3,23,"And this is his commandment: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us."
62,3,24,"The person who keeps his commandments abides in God, and God abides in him. This is how we can be sure that he remains in us: he has given us his Spirit."
62,4,1,"Dear friends, stop believing every spirit. Instead, test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
62,4,2,"This is how you can recognize God's Spirit: Every spirit who acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God."
62,4,3,"But every spirit who does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist. You have heard that he is coming, and now he is already in the world."
62,4,4,"Little children, you belong to God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world."
62,4,5,"These people belong to the world. That is why they speak from the world's perspective, and the world listens to them."
62,4,6,"We belong to God. The person who knows God listens to us. Whoever does not belong to God does not listen to us. This is how we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit."
62,4,7,"Dear friends, let us continually love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born from God and knows God."
62,4,8,"The person who does not love does not know God, because God is love."
62,4,9,"This is how God's love was revealed among us: God sent his unique Son into the world so that we might live through him."
62,4,10,"This is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins."
62,4,11,"Dear friends, if this is the way God loved us, we must also love one another."
62,4,12,"No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us."
62,4,13,"This is how we know that we abide in him and he in us: he has given us his Spirit."
62,4,14,"We have seen for ourselves and can testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world."
62,4,15,"God abides in the one who acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, and he abides in God."
62,4,16,"We have come to know and believe in the love that God has for us. God is love, and the person who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him."
62,4,17,"This is how love has been perfected among us: we will have confidence on the day of judgment because, while we are in this world, we are just like him."
62,4,18,"There is no fear where love exists. Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love."
62,4,19,"We love because he first loved us."
62,4,20,"Whoever says, “I love God,” but hates his brother is a liar. The one who does not love the brother whom he has seen cannot love a God whom he has not seen."
62,4,21,"And this is the commandment that we have from him: the person who loves God must also love his brother."
62,5,1,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born from God, and everyone who loves the parent also loves the child."
62,5,2,"This is how we know that we love God's children: we love God and keep his commandments."
62,5,3,"For this is the love of God: that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not difficult,"
62,5,4,"because everyone who is born from God has overcome the world. Our faith is the victory that overcomes the world."
62,5,5,"Who overcomes the world? Is it not the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"
62,5,6,"This man, Jesus Christ, is the one who came by water and blood—not with water only, but with water and with blood. The Spirit is the one who verifies this, because the Spirit is the truth."
62,5,7,"For there are three witnesses—"
62,5,8,"the Spirit, the water, and the blood—and these three are one."
62,5,9,"If we accept human testimony, God's testimony is greater, because it is the testimony of God and because he has testified about his Son."
62,5,10,"The person who believes in the Son of God has this testimony in himself. The person who does not believe God has made him a liar by not believing the testimony that God has given about his Son."
62,5,11,"This is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is found in his Son."
62,5,12,"The person who has the Son has this life. The person who does not have the Son of God does not have this life."
62,5,13,"I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life."
62,5,14,"And this is the confidence that we have in him: if we ask for anything according to his will, he listens to us."
62,5,15,"And if we know that he listens to our requests, we can be sure that we have what we ask him for."
62,5,16,"If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray that God would give him life. This applies to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not telling you to pray about that."
62,5,17,"Every kind of wrongdoing is sin, yet there are sins that do not lead to death."
62,5,18,"We know that the person who has been born from God does not go on sinning. Rather, the Son of God protects them, and the evil one cannot harm them."
62,5,19,"We know that we are from God and that the whole world lies under the control of the evil one."
62,5,20,"We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know the true God. We are in union with the one who is true, his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life."
62,5,21,"Little children, guard yourselves from idols."
63,1,1,"From the elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not only I but also all who know the truth,"
63,1,2,"because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever."
63,1,3,"Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, in truth and love."
63,1,4,"I was overjoyed to find some of your children living in the truth, just as the Father has commanded us."
63,1,5,"I am now requesting you, dear lady, that we continue to love each other. It is not as though I am writing to give you a new commandment, but one that we have had from the beginning."
63,1,6,"And this is love: that we live according to his commandments. This is his commandment, just as you have heard it from the beginning. You must live by it."
63,1,7,"For many deceivers have gone out into the world. They refuse to acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. Any such person is a deceiver and an antichrist."
63,1,8,"See to it that you don't destroy what we have worked for, but that you receive your full reward."
63,1,9,"Everyone who does not abide in the teaching of Christ but goes beyond it does not have God. The person who abides in the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son."
63,1,10,"If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your home or even greet him,"
63,1,11,"for the one who greets him shares in his evil deeds."
63,1,12,"Although I have a great deal to write to you, I would prefer not to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come to you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete."
63,1,13,"The children of your chosen sister greet you."
64,1,1,"From the elder to my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in truth."
64,1,2,"Dear friend, I pray that you are doing well in every way and that you are healthy, just as your soul is healthy."
64,1,3,"For I was overjoyed when some brothers arrived and testified about your truthfulness and how you live according to the truth."
64,1,4,"I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are living according to the truth."
64,1,5,"Dear friend, you are faithful in whatever you do for the brothers, especially when they are strangers."
64,1,6,"They have testified before the church about your love. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God."
64,1,7,"After all, they went on their trip for the sake of Christ's name, accepting no support from the Gentiles."
64,1,8,"Therefore, we ought to support such people so that we can become their helpers in spreading the truth."
64,1,9,"I wrote a letter to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be in charge, will not accept us."
64,1,10,"For this reason, when I come I will call attention to what he is doing in spreading false charges against us. And not content with that, he refuses to accept the brothers. He even tries to stop those who want to accept them and throws them out of the church."
64,1,11,"Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The person who does what is good is from God. The person who does what is evil has never seen God."
64,1,12,"Demetrius has received a good report from everyone, including the truth itself. We, too, can testify to this, and you know that our testimony is true."
64,1,13,"Although I have a great deal to write to you, I would rather not write with pen and ink."
64,1,14,"Instead, I hope to see you soon and talk face to face.May peace be with you! Your friends greet you. Greet each of our friends by name."
65,1,1,"From Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and yet a brother of James, to those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father and kept safe by Jesus Christ."
65,1,2,"May mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance!"
65,1,3,"Dear friends, although I was eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I found it necessary to write to you and urge you to continue your vigorous defense of the faith that was passed down to the saints once and for all."
65,1,4,"For some people have slipped in among you unnoticed. They were written about long ago as being deserving of this condemnation because they are ungodly. They turn the grace of our God into uncontrollable lust and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ."
65,1,5,"Now I want to remind you, even though you are fully aware of these things, that the Lord who once saved his people from the land of Egypt later destroyed those who did not believe."
65,1,6,"He has also held in eternal chains those angels who did not keep their own position but abandoned their assigned place. They are held in deepest darkness for judgment on the great day."
65,1,7,"Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities near them, which like them committed sexual sins and engaged in homosexual activities, serve as an example of the punishment of eternal fire."
65,1,8,"In a similar way, these dreamers also defile their flesh, reject the Lord's authority, and slander his glorious beings."
65,1,9,"Even the archangel Michael, when he argued with the devil and fought over the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him but said, “May the Lord rebuke you!”"
65,1,10,"Whatever these people do not understand, they slander. Like irrational animals, they are destroyed by the very things they know by instinct."
65,1,11,"How terrible it will be for them! For they followed the path of Cain, rushed headlong into Balaam's error to make a profit, and destroyed themselves in Korah's rebellion."
65,1,12,"These people are stains on your love feasts. They feast with you without any sense of awe. They are shepherds who care only for themselves. They are waterless clouds blown about by the winds. They are autumn trees that are fruitless, twice dead, and uprooted."
65,1,13,"They are wild waves of the sea, churning up the foam of their own shame. They are wandering stars for whom the deepest darkness has been reserved forever."
65,1,14,"Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied about these people when he said,“Look! The Lord has come with countless thousands of his holy ones."
65,1,15,"He will execute judgment on all people and convict everyone of all the ungodly things that they have done in such an ungodly way, including all the harsh things that these ungodly sinners have said about him.”"
65,1,16,"These people are complainers and faultfinders, following their own desires. Their mouths speak arrogant things, and they flatter people in order to take advantage of them."
65,1,17,"But you, dear friends, must remember the statements and predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ."
65,1,18,"They kept telling you, “In the last times mockers will appear, following their own ungodly desires.”"
65,1,19,"These are the people who cause divisions. They are worldly, devoid of the Spirit."
65,1,20,"But you, dear friends, must continue to build yourselves up on your most holy faith. Pray in the Holy Spirit,"
65,1,21,"and remain in God's love as you look for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that brings eternal life."
65,1,22,"Show mercy to those who have doubts."
65,1,23,"Save others by snatching them from the fire. To others, show mercy, but with fear, hating even the clothes stained by their sinful lives."
65,1,24,"Now to the one who is able to keep you from falling and to make you stand faultless in his glorious presence with rejoicing,"
65,1,25,"to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, power, and authority before all time and for all eternity! Amen."
66,1,1,"This is the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants the things that must happen soon. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,"
66,1,2,"who testified to what he saw: the word of God and the testimony about Jesus Christ."
66,1,3,"How blessed is the one who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep what is written in it, for the time is near!"
66,1,4,"From John to the seven churches in Asia. May grace and peace be yours from the one who is, who was, and who is coming, from the seven spirits who are in front of his throne,"
66,1,5,"and from Jesus Christ, the witness, the faithful one, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood"
66,1,6,"and has made us a kingdom, priests for his God and Father, be glory and power forever and ever! Amen."
66,1,7,"Look! He is coming in the clouds.Every eye will see him, even those who pierced him,and all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of him.So be it! Amen."
66,1,8,""
66,1,9,"I am John, your brother and partner in suffering, ruling, and enduring because of Jesus. I was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus."
66,1,10,"I came to be in the Spirit on the Day of the Lord, when I heard a loud voice behind me like a trumpet,"
66,1,11,"saying,"
66,1,12,"Then I turned to see the voice that was talking to me, and when I turned I saw seven gold lampstands."
66,1,13,"Among the lampstands there was someone like the Son of Man. He was wearing a long robe with a gold belt around his waist."
66,1,14,"His head and his hair were white like wool, in fact, as white as snow. His eyes were like flames of fire,"
66,1,15,"his feet were like glowing bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of raging waters."
66,1,16,"In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword. His face was like the sun when it shines with full force."
66,1,17,"When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. But he placed his right hand on me and said,"

66,4,1,"After these things I saw a door standing open in heaven. The first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said,"
66,4,2,"Instantly I was in the Spirit, and I saw a throne in heaven with a person seated on the throne."
66,4,3,"The person sitting there looked like jasper and carnelian, and there was a rainbow around the throne that looked like an emerald."
66,4,4,"Around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these thrones sat twenty-four elders wearing white robes and gold victor's crowns on their heads."
66,4,5,"Flashes of lightning, noises, and peals of thunder came from the throne. Burning in front of the throne were seven flaming torches, which are the seven spirits of God."
66,4,6,"In front of the throne was something like a sea of glass as clear as crystal. In the center of the throne and on each side of the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back."
66,4,7,"The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like an ox, the third living creature had a face like a human, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle."
66,4,8,"Each of the four living creatures had six wings and were full of eyes inside and out. Without stopping day or night they were singing,	“Holy, holy, holyis the Lord God Almighty,who was, who is, and who is coming.”"
66,4,9,"Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,"
66,4,10,"the twenty-four elders bow down in front of the one who sits on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever. They throw their victor's crowns in front of the throne and say,"
66,4,11,"“You are worthy, our Lord and God,to receive glory, honor, and power,because you created all things,				and they came into existence				and were created because of your will.”"
66,5,1,"Then I saw in the right hand of the one who sits on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the outside, sealed with seven seals."
66,5,2,"I also saw a powerful angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”"
66,5,3,"No one in heaven, on earth, or under the earth could open the scroll or look inside it."
66,5,4,"I began to cry bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it."
66,5,5,"Then one of the elders said to me, “Stop crying. Look! The Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered. He can open the scroll and its seven seals.”"
66,5,6,"Then I saw a lamb standing in the middle of the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders. He looked like he had been slaughtered. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent into all the earth."
66,5,7,"He went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who sits on the throne."
66,5,8,"When the lamb had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders bowed down in front of him. Each held a harp and a gold bowl full of incense, the prayers of the saints."
66,5,9,"They sang a new song:	“You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals,because you were slaughtered.	With your blood you purchased people for Godfrom every tribe, language, people, and nation."
66,5,10,"You made them a kingdom and priests for our God,and they will reign on the earth.”"
66,5,11,"Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels, the living creatures, and the elders surrounding the throne. They numbered ten thousands times ten thousand and thousands times thousands."
66,5,12,"They sang with a loud voice,	“Worthy is the lamb who was slaughteredto receive power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise!”"
66,5,13,"I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and on the sea, and everything that is in them, saying,	“To the one who sits on the throne and to the lambbe praise, honor, glory, and powerforever and ever!”"
66,5,14,"Then the four living creatures said, “Amen!”, and the elders bowed down and worshiped."
66,6,1,"Then I saw the lamb open the first of the seven seals. I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Go!”"
66,6,2,"Then I looked, and there was a white horse! Its rider had a bow, and a victor's crown had been given to him. He went out as a conqueror to conquer."
66,6,3,"When the lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Go!”"
66,6,4,"A second horse went out. It was fiery red, and its rider was given permission to take peace away from the earth and to make people slaughter one another. So he was given a large sword."
66,6,5,"When the lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Go!” I looked, and there was a black horse! Its rider held a scale in his hand."
66,6,6,"I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living creatures, saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, or three quarts of barley for a denarius. But don't damage the olive oil or the wine!”"
66,6,7,"When the lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Go!”"
66,6,8,"I looked, and there was a pale horse! Its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him. They were given authority over one-fourth of the earth to kill people using wars, famines, plagues, and the wild animals of the earth."
66,6,9,"When the lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God and the testimony they had given."
66,6,10,"They cried out in a loud voice, “Holy and true Sovereign, how long will it be before you judge and take revenge on those living on the earth who shed our blood?”"
66,6,11,"Each of them was given a white robe. They were told to rest a little longer until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers was completed, who would be killed as they had been killed."
66,6,12,"Then I saw the lamb open the sixth seal. There was a powerful earthquake. The sun turned as black as sackcloth made of hair, and the full moon turned as red as blood."
66,6,13,"The stars in the sky fell to the earth like a fig tree drops its fruit when it is shaken by a strong wind."
66,6,14,"The sky vanished like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place."
66,6,15,"Then the kings of the earth, the important people, the generals, the rich, the powerful, and all the slaves and free people hid themselves in caves and among the rocks in the mountains."
66,6,16,"They said to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb."
66,6,17,"For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to endure it?”"
66,7,1,"After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth. They were holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on the land, on the sea, or on any tree."
66,7,2,"I saw another angel coming from the east having the seal of the living God. He cried out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been permitted to harm the land and sea,"
66,7,3,"“Don't harm the land, the sea, or the trees until we have marked the servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads.”"
66,7,4,"I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000. Those who were sealed were from every tribe of Israel:"
66,7,5,"12,000 from the tribe of Judah were sealed, 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben, 12,000 from the tribe of Gad,"
66,7,6,"12,000 from the tribe of Asher, 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,"
66,7,7,"12,000 from the tribe of Simeon, 12,000 from the tribe of Levi, 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,"
66,7,8,"12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph, and 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed."
66,7,9,"After these things I looked, and there was a large crowd that no one was able to count! They were from every nation, tribe, people, and language. They were standing in front of the throne and the lamb and were wearing white robes, with palm branches in their hands."
66,7,10,"They cried out in a loud voice,	“Salvation belongs to our God,who sits on the throne,and to the lamb!”"
66,7,11,"All the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God,"
66,7,12,"saying,	“Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strengthbe to our God forever and ever! Amen!”"
66,7,13,"Then one of the elders said to me, “Who are these people wearing white robes, and where did they come from?”"
66,7,14,"I said to him, “Sir, you know.”Then he told me, “These are the people who are coming out of the terrible suffering. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb."
66,7,15,"That is why:	“They are in front of the throne of Godand worship him night and day in his temple.	The one who sits on the throne will shelter them."
66,7,16,"They will never be hungry or thirsty again.Neither the sun nor any burning heat will ever strike them,"
66,7,17,"for the lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd.	He will lead them to springs filled with the water of life,and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.”"
66,8,1,"When the lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."
66,8,2,"Then I saw the seven angels who stand in God's presence, and seven trumpets were given to them."
66,8,3,"Another angel came with a gold censer and stood at the altar. He was given a large quantity of incense to offer on the gold altar before the throne, along with the prayers of all the saints."
66,8,4,"The smoke from the incense and the prayers of the saints went up from the angel's hand to God."
66,8,5,"The angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it on the earth. Then there were peals of thunder, noises, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake."
66,8,6,"The seven angels who had the seven trumpets got ready to blow them."
66,8,7,"When the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire were mixed with blood and thrown on the earth. One-third of the earth was burned up, one-third of the trees was burned up, and all the green grass was burned up."
66,8,8,"When the second angel blew his trumpet, something like a huge mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. One-third of the sea turned into blood,"
66,8,9,"one-third of the creatures that were living in the sea died, and one-third of the ships was destroyed."
66,8,10,"When the third angel blew his trumpet, a huge star blazing like a torch fell from heaven. It fell on one-third of the rivers and on the springs of water."
66,8,11,"The name of the star is Wormwood. One-third of the water turned into wormwood, and many people died from the water because it had turned bitter."
66,8,12,"When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, one-third of the sun, one-third of the moon, and one-third of the stars were struck so that one-third of them turned dark. One-third of the day was kept from shining, and also the night."
66,8,13,"Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying overhead say in a loud voice, “How terrible, how terrible, how terrible for those living on the earth, because of the blasts of the remaining trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”"
66,9,1,"When the fifth angel blew his trumpet, I saw a star that had fallen to earth from the sky. The star was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit."
66,9,2,"It opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and smoke came out of the shaft like the smoke from a large furnace. The sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft."
66,9,3,"Locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth, and they were given power like the power of earthly scorpions."
66,9,4,"They were told not to harm the grass on the earth, any green plant, or any tree. They could harm only the people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads."
66,9,5,"They were not allowed to kill them, but were only allowed to torture them for five months. Their torture was like the pain of a scorpion when it stings someone."
66,9,6,"In those days people will look for death and never find it. They will long to die, but death will escape them."
66,9,7,"The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were victor's crowns that looked like gold, and their faces were like human faces."
66,9,8,"They had hair like women's hair and teeth like lions’ teeth."
66,9,9,"They had breastplates like iron, and the noise of their wings was like the roar of chariots with many horses rushing into battle."
66,9,10,"They had tails and stingers like scorpions, and they had the power to hurt people with their tails for five months."
66,9,11,"They had the angel of the bottomless pit ruling over them as king. In Hebrew he is called Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon."
66,9,12,"The first catastrophe is over. After these things there are still two more catastrophes to come."
66,9,13,"When the sixth angel blew his trumpet, I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar in front of God."
66,9,14,"It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are held at the great Euphrates River.”"
66,9,15,"So the four angels who were ready for that hour, day, month, and year were released to kill one-third of humanity."
66,9,16,"The number of cavalry troops was 200,000,000. I heard how many there were."
66,9,17,"This was how I saw the horses in my vision: The riders wore breastplates that had the color of fire, sapphire, and sulfur. The heads of the horses were like lions’ heads, and fire, smoke, and sulfur came out of their mouths."
66,9,18,"By these three plagues—the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came out of their mouths—one-third of humanity was killed."
66,9,19,"For the power of these horses is in their mouths and their tails. Their tails have heads like snakes, which they use to inflict pain."
66,9,20,"The rest of the people who survived these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands or stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see, hear, or walk."
66,9,21,"They did not repent of their murders, their deeds of witchcraft, their acts of sexual immorality, or their thefts."
66,10,1,"Then I saw another powerful angel come down from heaven. He was dressed in a cloud, and there was a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun, and his legs were like columns of fire."
66,10,2,"He held a small, opened scroll in his hand. Setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,"
66,10,3,"he shouted in a loud voice as a lion roars. When he shouted, the seven thunders spoke with voices of their own."
66,10,4,"When the seven thunders spoke, I was going to write, but I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and don't write it down.”"
66,10,5,"Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven."
66,10,6,"He swore an oath by the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and everything in it, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it: “There will be no more delay."
66,10,7,"In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet, the secret of God will be fulfilled, as he had announced to his servants, the prophets.”"
66,10,8,"Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go and take the opened scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”"
66,10,9,"So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the small scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will be bitter in your stomach, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.”"
66,10,10,"So I took the small scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was bitter."
66,10,11,"Then the seven thunders told me, “Again you must prophesy about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”"
66,11,1,"Then I was given a stick like a measuring rod. I was told, “Stand up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count those who worship there."
66,11,2,"But don't measure the courtyard outside the temple. Leave that out, because it is given to the nations, and they will trample the Holy City for forty-two months."
66,11,3,"I will give my two witnesses who wear sackcloth the authority to prophesy for 1,260 days.”"
66,11,4,"These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing in the presence of the Lord of the earth."
66,11,5,"And if anyone should want to hurt them, fire comes out of their mouths and burns up their enemies. If anyone wants to hurt them, he must be killed in the same way."
66,11,6,"These witnesses have authority to shut the sky in order to keep rain from falling during the days of their prophesying. They also have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with any plague as often as they desire."
66,11,7,"When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will wage war against them, conquer them, and kill them."
66,11,8,"Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified."
66,11,9,"For three and a half days some members of the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will look at their dead bodies and will not allow them to be placed in a tomb."
66,11,10,"Those living on earth will gloat over them, celebrate, and send gifts to each other, because these two prophets had tormented those living on earth."
66,11,11,"But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet. Those who watched them were terrified."
66,11,12,"Then the witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven calling to them, “Come up here!” So they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them."
66,11,13,"At that moment a powerful earthquake struck. One-tenth of the city collapsed, 7,000 people were killed by the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven."
66,11,14,"The second catastrophe is over. The third catastrophe is coming very soon."
66,11,15,"When the seventh angel blew his trumpet, there were loud voices in heaven, saying,	“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ,and he will rule forever and ever.”"
66,11,16,"Then the twenty-four elders who were sitting on their thrones in God's presence fell on their faces and worshiped God."
66,11,17,"They said,	“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,who is and who was,because you have taken your great powerand have begun to rule."
66,11,18,"The nations were angry,but your wrath has come.	It is time for the dead to be judged—to reward your servants, the prophets, the saints, and all who fear your name,both unimportant and important,and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”"
66,11,19,"Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen inside his temple. There were flashes of lightning, noises, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail."
66,12,1,"A spectacular sign appeared in the sky: a woman dressed with the sun, who had the moon under her feet and a victor's crown of twelve stars on her head."
66,12,2,"She was pregnant and was crying out from labor pains and the agony of giving birth."
66,12,3,"Then another sign appeared in the sky: a huge red dragon with seven heads, ten horns, and seven royal crowns on its heads."
66,12,4,"Its tail swept away one-third of the stars in the sky and threw them down to the earth. Then the dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that it could devour her child when it was born."
66,12,5,"She gave birth to a son, a boy, who is to rule all the nations with an iron scepter. But her child was snatched away and taken to God and to his throne."
66,12,6,"Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where a place had been prepared for her by God so that she might be taken care of for 1,260 days."
66,12,7,"Then a war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels fought back."
66,12,8,"But it was not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven."
66,12,9,"The huge dragon was thrown down. That ancient serpent, called devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world, was thrown down to the earth, and its angels were thrown down with it."
66,12,10,"Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say,	“Now the salvation, the power,the kingdom of our God,and the authority of his Christ have come.	For the one accusing our brothers,the one who accuses them day and nightin the presence of our God, has been thrown out."
66,12,11,"They conquered him by the blood of the lamband by the word of their testimony,for they did not love their life even in the face of death."
66,12,12,"So be glad, heavens, and those who live in them!	How terrible it is for the earth and the sea,because the devil has come down to you with great wrath,knowing that his time is short!”"
66,12,13,"When the dragon saw that it had been thrown down to the earth, it persecuted the woman who had given birth to the boy."
66,12,14,"However, the woman was given the two wings of a large eagle so that she could fly away from the serpent to her place in the wilderness, where she could be taken care of for a time, times, and half a time."
66,12,15,"From its mouth the serpent poured water like a river behind the woman in order to sweep her away with the flood."
66,12,16,"But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had poured from its mouth."
66,12,17,"Then the dragon became angry with the woman and went away to do battle against the rest of her children, the ones who keep God's commandments and hold on to the testimony about Jesus."
66,13,1,"Then the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore.I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns, seven heads, and ten royal crowns on its horns. On its heads were blasphemous names."
66,13,2,"The beast that I saw was like a leopard. Its feet were like bear's feet, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. The dragon gave it his power, his throne, and complete authority."
66,13,3,"One of the beast's heads looked like it had a fatal wound, but its fatal wound was healed. And in amazement the whole world followed the beast."
66,13,4,"They worshiped the dragon because it had given authority to the beast. They also worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can fight a war with it?”"
66,13,5,"The beast was allowed to speak arrogant and blasphemous things, and it was given authority for forty-two months."
66,13,6,"It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God and to blaspheme his name and his residence, that is, those who are living in heaven."
66,13,7,"It was allowed to wage war against the saints and to conquer them. It was also given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation."
66,13,8,"All those living on earth will worship it, everyone whose name is not written in the Book of Life belonging to the lamb that was slaughtered from the foundation of the world."
66,13,9,"Let anyone who has an ear listen:"
66,13,10,"If anyone is to be taken captive,he must go into captivity.	If anyone is to be killed with a sword,he must be killed with a sword.This is what the endurance and faith of the saints means."
66,13,11,"Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it talked like a dragon."
66,13,12,"It uses all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and it makes the earth and those living on it worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed."
66,13,13,"It performs spectacular signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people."
66,13,14,"It deceives those living on earth with the signs that it is allowed to do on behalf of the first beast, telling them to make an image for the beast who was wounded by a sword and yet lived."
66,13,15,"The second beast was allowed to give breath to the image of the first beast so that the image of the beast could talk and put to death those who would not worship the image of the beast."
66,13,16,"The second beast forces all people—important and unimportant, rich and poor, free and slaves—to be marked on their right hands or on their foreheads,"
66,13,17,"so that no one may buy or sell unless he has the mark, which is the beast's name or the number of its name."
66,13,18,"This calls for wisdom: Let the person who has understanding figure out the number of the beast, because it is the number of a person. Its number is 666."
66,14,1,"Then I looked, and there was the lamb standing on Mount Zion! With him were 144,000 people who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads."
66,14,2,"Then I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps."
66,14,3,"They were singing a new song in front of the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth."
66,14,4,"They have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins, and they follow the lamb wherever he goes. They have been redeemed from among humanity as the first fruits for God and the lamb."
66,14,5,"In their mouth no lie was found. They are blameless."
66,14,6,"Then I saw another angel flying overhead with the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people."
66,14,7,"He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship the one who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.”"
66,14,8,"Then another angel, a second one, followed him, saying, “Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen! She has made all the nations drink the wine of the wrath of her sexual sins.”"
66,14,9,"Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying in a loud voice, “Whoever worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or his hand"
66,14,10,"will drink the wine of God's wrath, which has been poured unmixed into the cup of his anger. He will be tortured with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the lamb."
66,14,11,"The smoke from their torture goes up forever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”"
66,14,12,"Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and hold on to the faithfulness of Jesus."
66,14,13,"I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: How blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!”“Yes,” says the Spirit. “Let them rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.”"
66,14,14,"Then I looked, and there was a white cloud! On the cloud sat someone who was like the Son of Man, with a gold victor's crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand."
66,14,15,"Another angel came out of the temple, crying out in a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud, “Swing your sickle, and gather the harvest, for the hour has come to gather it, because the harvest on the earth is fully ripe.”"
66,14,16,"The one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested."
66,14,17,"Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven. He, too, had a sharp sickle."
66,14,18,"From the altar came another angel who had authority over fire. He called out in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp sickle, “Swing your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches of grapes from the vine of the earth, because those grapes are ripe.”"
66,14,19,"So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the grapes from the earth and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath."
66,14,20,"The wine press was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed out of the wine press as high as a horse's bridle for 200 miles."
66,15,1,"I saw another sign in heaven. It was spectacular and amazing. There were seven angels with the seven last plagues. With them God's wrath has come to its completion."
66,15,2,"Then I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. Those who had conquered the beast, its image, and the number of its name were standing on the sea of glass holding God's harps in their hands."
66,15,3,"They sang the song of God's servant Moses and the song of the lamb:	“Your deeds are spectacular and amazing, Lord God Almighty.	Your ways are just and true, King of the nations."
66,15,4,"Lord, who won't fear and praise your name?For you alone are holy,and all the nations will come and worship you because your judgments have been revealed.”"
66,15,5,"After these things I looked, and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was open!"
66,15,6,"The seven angels with the seven plagues came out of the temple wearing clean, shining linen with gold belts around their waists."
66,15,7,"One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven gold bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever."
66,15,8,"The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels came to an end."
66,16,1,"Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour the seven bowls of God's wrath on the earth.”"
66,16,2,"So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth. A horrible, painful sore appeared on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped the image."
66,16,3,"The second angel poured his bowl into the sea. It became like the blood of a dead body, and every living thing in the sea died."
66,16,4,"The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they turned into blood."
66,16,5,"Then I heard the angel of the water say,	“You are just. You are the one who isand who was, the Holy One,because you have judged these things."
66,16,6,"You have given them blood to drinkbecause they have poured out the blood of saints and prophets.This is what they deserve.”"
66,16,7,"Then I heard the altar reply,	“Yes, Lord God Almighty,your judgments are true and just.”"
66,16,8,"The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun. It was allowed to burn people with fire,"
66,16,9,"and they were burned by the fierce heat. They cursed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory."
66,16,10,"The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast. Its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed on their tongues in anguish"
66,16,11,"and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores. But they did not repent of their deeds."
66,16,12,"The sixth angel poured his bowl on the great Euphrates River. Its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east."
66,16,13,"Then I saw three disgusting spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet."
66,16,14,"They are demonic spirits that perform signs. They go to the kings of the whole earth and gather them for the war of the great day of God Almighty."
66,16,15,""
66,16,16,"The spirits gathered the kings at the place that is called Armageddon in Hebrew."
66,16,17,"The seventh angel poured his bowl into the air. A loud voice came from the throne in the temple and said, “It has happened!”"
66,16,18,"There were flashes of lightning, noises, peals of thunder, and a powerful earthquake. There has never been such a powerful earthquake since people have been on the earth."
66,16,19,"The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. God remembered to give Babylon the Great the cup of wine filled with the fury of his wrath."
66,16,20,"Every island vanished, and the mountains could no longer be found."
66,16,21,"Huge hailstones, each weighing about 100 pounds, fell from the sky on people. They cursed God because the plague of hail was such a terrible plague."
66,17,1,"Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the judgment of the notorious prostitute who sits on many waters."
66,17,2,"The kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and those living on earth became drunk with the wine of her immorality.”"
66,17,3,"Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was filled with blasphemous names. It had seven heads and ten horns."
66,17,4,"The woman wore purple and scarlet clothes and was adorned with gold, gems, and pearls. In her hand she was holding a gold cup filled with detestable things and the impurities of her immorality."
66,17,5,"On her forehead was written a secret name:BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND DETESTABLE THINGS OF THE EARTH."
66,17,6,"I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses to Jesus. I was very surprised when I saw her."
66,17,7,"The angel said to me, “Why are you surprised? I will tell you the secret of the woman and the beast with the seven heads and the ten horns that carries her."
66,17,8,"The beast that you saw once was, is no longer, and is going to come from the bottomless pit and go to its destruction. Those living on earth, whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, will be surprised when they see the beast because it was, is no longer, and will come again."
66,17,9,"This calls for a mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is sitting. They are also seven kings."
66,17,10,"Five of them have fallen, one is living, and the other has not yet come. When he comes, he must remain for a little while."
66,17,11,"The beast that was and is no longer is the eighth king, but it belongs with the seven kings and goes to its destruction."
66,17,12,"The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom. They will receive authority to rule as kings with the beast for one hour."
66,17,13,"They have one purpose: to give their power and authority to the beast."
66,17,14,"They will wage war against the lamb, but the lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. Those who are called, chosen, and faithful are with him.”"
66,17,15,"The angel also said to me, “The waters you saw, on which the prostitute is sitting, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages."
66,17,16,"The ten horns and the beast you saw will hate the prostitute. They will leave her abandoned and naked. They will eat her flesh and burn her up with fire,"
66,17,17,"for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose. And so they will give their kingdom to the beast until God's words are fulfilled."
66,17,18,"The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”"
66,18,1,"After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was made bright by his splendor."
66,18,2,"He cried out in a powerful voice,	“Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen!She has become a home for demons.	She is a prison for every unclean spirit,a prison for every unclean bird,and a prison for every uncleanand hated beast."
66,18,3,"For all the nations have drunkfrom the wine of her sexual immorality,	and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her.	The merchants of the earth have become richfrom the power of her luxury.”"
66,18,4,"Then I heard another voice from heaven saying,	“Come out of her, my people,so that you don't participate in her sinsand suffer from her plagues."
66,18,5,"For her sins are piled as high as heaven,and God has remembered her crimes."
66,18,6,"Do to her as she herself has done.Give her double for her deeds.	Mix a double drink for her in the cup she mixed."
66,18,7,"Just as she glorified herself and lived in luxury,so give her just as much torture and misery.	In her heart she says,‘I am a queen on a throne, not a widow.I will never see misery.’"
66,18,8,"For this reason her plagues of death, misery, and famine will come in a single day.	She will be burned up in a fire,because powerful is the Lord God who judges her.”"
66,18,9,"The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality with her and lived in luxury with her, will cry and mourn over her when they see the smoke rising from her fire."
66,18,10,"Frightened by her torture, they will stand far away and say,	“How terrible, how terrible it is for that great city,the powerful city Babylon!For in one hour your judgment has come!”"
66,18,11,"The merchants of the earth cry and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo anymore—"
66,18,12,"cargo of gold, silver, gems, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all articles made of ivory, all articles made of very costly wood, bronze, iron, marble,"
66,18,13,"cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, and slaves (that is, human souls)."
66,18,14,"“The fruit for which your soul craved has left you.All your dainties and your splendor are lost to you. No one will ever find them again.”"
66,18,15,"Frightened by her torture, the merchants of these wares who had become rich from her will stand far away. They will cry and mourn,"
66,18,16,"saying,	“How terrible, how terrible it is for the great citythat was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarletand was adorned with gold, gems, and pearls!"
66,18,17,"For in one hour all this wealth has been destroyed!”Every ship's captain, everyone who traveled by ship, sailors, and everyone who made a living by the sea stood far away."
66,18,18,"When they saw the smoke from her fire, they began to cry out, “What city was like the great city?”"
66,18,19,"Then they threw dust on their heads and shouted while crying and mourning,	“How terrible, how terrible it is for the great city,where all who had ships at sea became richbecause of her wealth!		For in one hour she has been destroyed!"
66,18,20,"Gloat over her, heaven, saints, apostles, and prophets!For God has condemned her for you.”"
66,18,21,"Then a powerful angel picked up a stone that was like a large millstone and threw it into the sea, saying,	“The great city Babylon will be thrown down with violent force—and will never be found again."
66,18,22,"The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeterswill never be heard in you again.	No artisan of any tradewill ever be found in you again.	The sound of a millstonewill never be heard in you again."
66,18,23,"The light from a lamp will never shine in you again.	The voice of a bridegroom and bridewill never be heard in you again.	For your merchants were the important people of the world,and all the nations were deceived by your witchcraft."
66,18,24,"The blood of prophets, saints, and all who had been murderedon earth was found in her.”"
66,19,1,"After these things I heard what sounded like the loud voice of a large crowd in heaven, saying,	“Hallelujah!	Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God."
66,19,2,"His judgments are true and just.He has condemned the notorious prostitutewho corrupted the world with her immorality.	He has taken revenge on herfor the blood of his servants.”"
66,19,3,"A second time they said,	“Hallelujah!The smoke goes up from her forever and ever.”"
66,19,4,"The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures bowed down and worshiped God, who was sitting on the throne. They said, “Amen! Hallelujah!”"
66,19,5,"A voice came from the throne, saying,	“Praise our God,all who serve and fear him,from the least importantto the most important.”"
66,19,6,"Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a large crowd, like the sound of raging waters, and like the sound of powerful thunderclaps, saying,	“Hallelujah!The Lord our God, the Almighty, is reigning."
66,19,7,"Let us rejoice, be glad, and give him glory,because the marriage of the lamb has comeand his bride has made herself ready."
66,19,8,"She has been given the privilege of wearing fine linen,dazzling and pure.”(The fine linen represents the righteous deeds of the saints.)"
66,19,9,"Then the angel said to me, “Write this: ‘How blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb!’” He also told me, “These are the true words of God.”"
66,19,10,"I bowed down at his feet to worship him, but he told me, “Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold on to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, because the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy!”"
66,19,11,"Then I saw heaven standing open, and there was a white horse! Its rider is named Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and wages war."
66,19,12,"His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many royal crowns. He has a name written on him that nobody knows except himself."
66,19,13,"He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God."
66,19,14,"The armies of heaven, wearing fine linen, white and pure, follow him on white horses."
66,19,15,"A sharp sword comes out of his mouth to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod and tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty."
66,19,16,"On his robe and his thigh he has a name written:KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS."
66,19,17,"Then I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried out in a loud voice to all the birds flying overhead, “Come! Gather for the great supper of God."
66,19,18,"Eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of warriors, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, both free and slaves, both unimportant and important.”"
66,19,19,"Then I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army."
66,19,20,"The beast was captured, along with the false prophet who had performed signs on its behalf. By these signs the false prophet had deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur."
66,19,21,"The rest were killed by the sword that belonged to the rider on the horse and that came from his mouth. And all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh."
66,20,1,"Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key to the bottomless pit and a large chain in his hand."
66,20,2,"He captured the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and tied him up for a thousand years."
66,20,3,"He threw him into the bottomless pit, locked it, and sealed it over him to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were over. After that he must be set free for a little while."
66,20,4,"Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or hands. They came back to life and ruled with Christ for a thousand years."
66,20,5,"The rest of the dead did not come back to life until the thousand years were over. This is the first resurrection."
66,20,6,"How blessed and holy are those who participate in the first resurrection! The second death has no power over them. They will be priests of God and Christ, and will rule with him for a thousand years."
66,20,7,"When the thousand years are over, Satan will be freed from his prison."
66,20,8,"He will go out to deceive Gog and Magog, the nations at the four corners of the earth, and gather them for war. They are as numerous as the sands of the seashore."
66,20,9,"They marched over the broad expanse of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. Fire came from God out of heaven and burned them up,"
66,20,10,"and the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were. They will be tortured day and night forever and ever."
66,20,11,"Then I saw a large, white throne and the one who was sitting on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and no place was found for them."
66,20,12,"I saw the dead, both unimportant and important, standing in front of the throne, and books were open. Another book was opened—the Book of Life. The dead were judged according to their works, as recorded in the books."
66,20,13,"The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and all were judged according to their works."
66,20,14,"Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. (This is the second death—the lake of fire.)"
66,20,15,"Anyone whose name was not found written in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of fire."
66,21,1,"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, because the first heaven and the first earth had disappeared, and the sea was gone."
66,21,2,"I also saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband."
66,21,3,"I heard a loud voice from the throne say, “See, the tabernacle of God is among humans! He will make his home with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them, and he will be their God."
66,21,4,"He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There won't be death anymore. There won't be any grief, crying, or pain, because the first things have disappeared.”"
66,21,5,"The one sitting on the throne said,"
66,21,6,"Then he said to me,"
66,21,7,""
66,21,8,""
66,21,9,"Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came to me and said, “Come! I will show you the bride, the wife of the lamb.”"
66,21,10,"He carried me away in the Spirit to a large, high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven."
66,21,11,"It had the glory of God, and its light was like a valuable gem, like jasper, as clear as crystal."
66,21,12,"It had a large, high wall with twelve gates. Twelve angels were at the gates, and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were written on the gates."
66,21,13,"There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west."
66,21,14,"The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb were written on them."
66,21,15,"The angel who was talking to me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its walls."
66,21,16,"The city was square: its length was the same as its width. He measured the city with his rod, and it was 12,000 stadia long. Its length, width, and height were the same."
66,21,17,"He also measured its wall. According to the human measurement that the angel was using it was 144 cubits."
66,21,18,"Its wall was made of jasper. The city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass."
66,21,19,"The foundations of the city wall were decorated with all kinds of gems: The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,"
66,21,20,"the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst."
66,21,21,"The twelve gates were twelve pearls, and each gate was made of a single pearl. The street of the city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass."
66,21,22,"I saw no temple in it, because the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are its temple."
66,21,23,"The city doesn't need any sun or moon to give it light, because the glory of God gave it light, and the lamb was its lamp."
66,21,24,"The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it."
66,21,25,"Its gates will never be shut by day, because there won't be any night there."
66,21,26,"People will bring the glory and wealth of the nations into it."
66,21,27,"Nothing unclean, or anyone who does anything detestable, and no one who tells lies will ever enter it. Only those whose names are written in the lamb's Book of Life will enter it."
66,22,1,"Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal. It was flowing from the throne of God and the lamb."
66,22,2,"Between the street of the city and the river there was the tree of life visible from both sides. It produced twelve kinds of fruit, each month having its own fruit. The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations."
66,22,3,"There will no longer be any curse. The throne of God and the lamb will be in the city. His servants will worship him"
66,22,4,"and see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads."
66,22,5,"There will be no more night, and they will not need any light from lamps or the sun because the Lord God will shine on them. They will rule forever and ever."
66,22,6,"He said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord God of the spirits and of the prophets has sent his angel to show his servants the things that must happen soon.”"
66,22,7,""
66,22,8,"I, John, heard and saw these things. When I had heard and seen them, I bowed down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things."
66,22,9,"But he told me, “Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you, your brothers the prophets, and those who keep the words in this book. Worship God!”"
66,22,10,"Then he said to me, “Don't seal up the words of the prophecy in this book, because the time is near."
66,22,11,"Let the one who does what is evil continue to do evil, and let the filthy person continue to be filthy, and the righteous person continue to do what is right, and the holy person continue to be holy.”"
66,22,12,""
66,22,13,""
66,22,14,"How blessed are those who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city!"
66,22,15,"Outside are dogs, sorcerers, immoral people, murderers, idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood."
66,22,16,""
66,22,17,"The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” Let everyone who hears this say, “Come!” Let everyone who is thirsty come! Let anyone who wants the water of life take it as a gift!"
66,22,18,"I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy in this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will strike him with the plagues that are written in this book."
66,22,19,"If anyone takes away any words from the book of this prophecy, God will take away his portion of the tree of life and the holy city that are described in this book."
66,22,20,"The one who is testifying to these things says,"
66,22,21,"May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen."
