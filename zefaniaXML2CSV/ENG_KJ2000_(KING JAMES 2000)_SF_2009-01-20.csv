1,20,9,"Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What have you done unto us? and how have I offended you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? you have done deeds unto me that ought not to be done."
1,20,10,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What was your thinking, that you have done this thing?"
1,20,11,"And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake."
1,20,12,"And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife."
1,20,13,"And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is your kindness which you shall show unto me; at every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother."
1,20,14,"And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife."
1,20,15,"And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before you: dwell where it pleases you."
1,20,16,"And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to you a vindication of the eyes, unto all that are with you, and with all others: thus she was righted."
1,20,17,"So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children."
1,20,18,"For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife."
1,21,1,"And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken."
1,21,2,"For Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him."
1,21,3,"And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac."
1,21,4,"And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him."
1,21,5,"And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him."
1,21,6,"And Sarah said, God has made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me."
1,21,7,"And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have nursed children? for I have borne him a son in his old age."
1,21,8,"And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned."
1,21,9,"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking."
1,21,10,"Therefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."
1,21,11,"And the thing was very displeasing in Abraham's sight because of his son."
1,21,12,"And God said unto Abraham,"

1,21,14,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a skin of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba."
1,21,15,"And the water was used up in the skin, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."
1,21,16,"And she went, and sat down apart from him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat away from him, and lifted up her voice, and wept."
1,21,17,"And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her,"
1,21,18,""
1,21,19,"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad a drink."
1,21,20,"And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer."
1,21,21,"And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt."
1,21,22,"And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the chief captain of his host spoke unto Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do:"
1,21,23,"Now therefore swear unto me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto you, you shall do unto me, and to the land in which you have sojourned."
1,21,24,"And Abraham said, I will swear."
1,21,25,"And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away."
1,21,26,"And Abimelech said, I know not who has done this thing: neither did you tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but today."
1,21,27,"And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant."
1,21,28,"And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves."
1,21,29,"And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?"
1,21,30,"And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shall you take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have dug this well."
1,21,31,"Therefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they swore both of them."
1,21,32,"Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines."
1,21,33,"And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God."
1,21,34,"And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days."
1,22,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that God did test Abraham, and said unto him,"
1,22,2,"And he said,"
1,22,3,"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and cut the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him."
1,22,4,"Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off."
1,22,5,"And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide you here with the donkey; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you."
1,22,6,"And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together."
1,22,7,"And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
1,22,8,"And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together."
1,22,9,"And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."
1,22,10,"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son."
1,22,11,"And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said,"
1,22,12,"And he said,"
1,22,13,"And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son."
1,22,14,"And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen."
1,22,15,"And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,"
1,22,16,"And said,"

1,22,19,"So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba."
1,22,20,"And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she has also borne children unto your brother Nahor;"
1,22,21,"Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,"
1,22,22,"And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
1,22,23,"And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother."
1,22,24,"And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bore also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah."
1,23,1,"And Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah."
1,23,2,"And Sarah died in Kiriatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her."
1,23,3,"And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke unto the sons of Heth, saying,"
1,23,4,"I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
1,23,5,"And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
1,23,6,"Hear us, my lord: you are a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury your dead; none of us shall withhold from you his sepulcher, but that you may bury your dead."
1,23,7,"And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth."
1,23,8,"And he spoke with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,"
1,23,9,"That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a burying place among you."
1,23,10,"And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,"
1,23,11,"Nay, my lord, hear me: the field I give you, and the cave that is in it, I give it to you; in the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you: bury your dead."
1,23,12,"And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land."
1,23,13,"And he spoke unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if you will give it, I pray you, hear me: I will give you money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there."
1,23,14,"And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,"
1,23,15,"My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that between me and you? bury therefore your dead."
1,23,16,"And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchants."
1,23,17,"And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made over"
1,23,18,"To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city."
1,23,19,"And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan."
1,23,20,"And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made over to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the sons of Heth."
1,24,1,"And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things."
1,24,2,"And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh:"
1,24,3,"And I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:"
1,24,4,"But you shall go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac."
1,24,5,"And the servant said unto him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring your son again unto the land from where you came?"
1,24,6,"And Abraham said unto him, Beware that you bring not my son there again."
1,24,7,"The LORD God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke unto me, and that swore unto me, saying, Unto your descendants will I give this land; he shall send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife unto my son from there."
1,24,8,"And if the woman will not be willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son there again."
1,24,9,"And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter."
1,24,10,"And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor."
1,24,11,"And he made his camels to kneel down outside the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water."
1,24,12,"And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray you, send me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham."
1,24,13,"Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:"
1,24,14,"And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down your pitcher, I pray you, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: let the same be she that you have appointed for your servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that you have showed kindness unto my master."
1,24,15,"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder."
1,24,16,"And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up."
1,24,17,"And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray you, drink a little water of your pitcher."
1,24,18,"And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hastened, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink."
1,24,19,"And when she had finished giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking."
1,24,20,"And she hastened, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels."
1,24,21,"And the man wondering at her held his peace, to learn whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not."
1,24,22,"And it came to pass, as the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;"
1,24,23,"And said, Whose daughter are you? tell me, I pray you: is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?"
1,24,24,"And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore unto Nahor."
1,24,25,"She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and fodder enough, and room to lodge in."
1,24,26,"And the man bowed down his head, and worshiped the LORD."
1,24,27,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who has not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's kinsmen."
1,24,28,"And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things."
1,24,29,"And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well."
1,24,30,"And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well."
1,24,31,"And he said, Come in, you blessed of the LORD; why stand you outside? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
1,24,32,"And the man came into the house: and he unloaded his camels, and gave straw and fodder for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him."
1,24,33,"And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on."
1,24,34,"And he said, I am Abraham's servant."
1,24,35,"And the LORD has blessed my master greatly; and he has become great: and he has given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and donkeys."
1,24,36,"And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old: and unto him has he given all that he has."
1,24,37,"And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:"
1,24,38,"But you shall go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son."
1,24,39,"And I said unto my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me."
1,24,40,"And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:"
1,24,41,"Then shall you be clear from this my oath, when you come to my kindred; and if they give you not one, you shall be clear from my oath."
1,24,42,"And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go:"
1,24,43,"Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin comes forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water of your pitcher to drink;"
1,24,44,"And she says to me, Both drink, and I will also draw for your camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD has appointed out for my master's son."
1,24,45,"And before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray you."
1,24,46,"And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also."
1,24,47,"And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore unto him: and I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her arms."
1,24,48,"And I bowed down my head, and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son."
1,24,49,"And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
1,24,50,"Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from the LORD: we cannot speak unto you bad or good."
1,24,51,"Behold, Rebekah is before you, take her, and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as the LORD has spoken."
1,24,52,"And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshiped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth."
1,24,53,"And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things."
1,24,54,"And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master."
1,24,55,"And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go."
1,24,56,"And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD has prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master."
1,24,57,"And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth."
1,24,58,"And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go."
1,24,59,"And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men."
1,24,60,"And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, You are our sister, be the mother of thousands of millions, and let your descendants possess the gate of those who hate them."
1,24,61,"And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way."
1,24,62,"And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the Negeb."
1,24,63,"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming."
1,24,64,"And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel."
1,24,65,"For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walks in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a veil, and covered herself."
1,24,66,"And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done."
1,24,67,"And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death."
1,25,1,"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah."
1,25,2,"And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah."
1,25,3,"And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim."
1,25,4,"And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah."
1,25,5,"And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac."
1,25,6,"But unto the sons of the concubines, whom Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country."
1,25,7,"And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred three score and fifteen years."
1,25,8,"Then Abraham died at a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people."
1,25,9,"And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;"
1,25,10,"The field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife."
1,25,11,"And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi."
1,25,12,"Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore unto Abraham:"
1,25,13,"And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,"
1,25,14,"And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,"
1,25,15,"Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:"
1,25,16,"These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations."
1,25,17,"And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty-seven years: and he breathed his last and died; and was gathered unto his people."
1,25,18,"And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is beside Egypt, as you go toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren."
1,25,19,"And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:"
1,25,20,"And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddanaram, the sister to Laban the Aramean."
1,25,21,"And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived."
1,25,22,"And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD."
1,25,23,"And the LORD said unto her,"
1,25,24,"And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb."
1,25,25,"And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau."
1,25,26,"And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was three score years old when she bore them."
1,25,27,"And the boys grew: and Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents."
1,25,28,"And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob."
1,25,29,"And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:"
1,25,30,"And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray you, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom."
1,25,31,"And Jacob said, Sell me this day your birthright."
1,25,32,"And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point of death: and what profit shall this birthright be to me?"
1,25,33,"And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob."
1,25,34,"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright."
1,26,1,"And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar."
1,26,2,"And the LORD appeared unto him, and said,"
1,26,3,""
1,26,4,""
1,26,5,""
1,26,6,"And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:"
1,26,7,"And the men of the place asked him about his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon."
1,26,8,"And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah his wife."
1,26,9,"And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a truth she is your wife: and how said you, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her."
1,26,10,"And Abimelech said, What is this you have done unto us? one of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guiltiness upon us."
1,26,11,"And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
1,26,12,"Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him."
1,26,13,"And the man became great, and advanced, and grew until he became very great:"
1,26,14,"For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and a great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him."
1,26,15,"For all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth."
1,26,16,"And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for you are much mightier than we."
1,26,17,"And Isaac departed from there, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there."
1,26,18,"And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them."
1,26,19,"And Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water."
1,26,20,"And the herdsmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him."
1,26,21,"And they dug another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah."
1,26,22,"And he removed from there, and dug another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land."
1,26,23,"And he went up from there to Beersheba."
1,26,24,"And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said,"
1,26,25,"And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants dug a well."
1,26,26,"Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phicol the chief captain of his army."
1,26,27,"And Isaac said unto them, Why come you to me, seeing you hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
1,26,28,"And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with you: and we said, Let there be now an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you;"
1,26,29,"That you will do us no hurt, as we have not touched you, and as we have done unto you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace: you are now the blessed of the LORD."
1,26,30,"And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink."
1,26,31,"And they rose up early in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace."
1,26,32,"And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said unto him, We have found water."
1,26,33,"And he called it Shibah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day."
1,26,34,"And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:"
1,26,35,"Who were a source of grief unto Isaac and to Rebekah."
1,27,1,"And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I."
1,27,2,"And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:"
1,27,3,"Now therefore take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;"
1,27,4,"And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless you before I die."
1,27,5,"And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it."
1,27,6,"And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak unto Esau your brother, saying,"
1,27,7,"Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before the LORD before my death."
1,27,8,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you."
1,27,9,"Go now to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory food for your father, such as he loves:"
1,27,10,"And you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, and that he may bless you before his death."
1,27,11,"And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:"
1,27,12,"My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing."
1,27,13,"And his mother said unto him, Upon me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go bring me them."
1,27,14,"And he went, and took, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved."
1,27,15,"And Rebekah took the best clothing of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:"
1,27,16,"And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:"
1,27,17,"And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob."
1,27,18,"And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who are you, my son?"
1,27,19,"And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau your firstborn; I have done according as you bade me: arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me."
1,27,20,"And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD your God brought it to me."
1,27,21,"And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray you, that I may feel you, my son, whether you be my very son Esau or not."
1,27,22,"And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
1,27,23,"And he recognized him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him."
1,27,24,"And he said, are you my very son Esau? And he said, I am."
1,27,25,"And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless you. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank."
1,27,26,"And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son."
1,27,27,"And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed:"
1,27,28,"Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine:"
1,27,29,"Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you: be lord over your brethren, and let your mother's sons bow down to you: cursed be everyone that curses you, and blessed be he that blesses you."
1,27,30,"And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting."
1,27,31,"And he also had made savory food, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that your soul may bless me."
1,27,32,"And Isaac his father said unto him, Who are you? And he said, I am your son, your firstborn Esau."
1,27,33,"And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that has taken venison, and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed."
1,27,34,"And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father."
1,27,35,"And he said, your brother came with subtlety, and has taken away your blessing."
1,27,36,"And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"
1,27,37,"And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with grain and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto you, my son?"
1,27,38,"And Esau said unto his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept."
1,27,39,"And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, your dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;"
1,27,40,"And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck."
1,27,41,"And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob."
1,27,42,"And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, your brother Esau, concerning you, does comfort himself, purposing to kill you."
1,27,43,"Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee to Laban my brother to Haran;"
1,27,44,"And tarry with him a few days, until your brother's fury turns away;"
1,27,45,"Until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets that which you have done to him: then I will send, and bring you from there: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?"
1,27,46,"And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these who are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?"
1,28,1,"And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, you shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan."
1,28,2,"Arise, go to Paddanaram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and take you a wife from there of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother."
1,28,3,"And God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a multitude of people;"
1,28,4,"And give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your descendants with you; that you may inherit the land in which you are a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham."
1,28,5,"And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Paddanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother."
1,28,6,"When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Paddanaram, to take him a wife from there; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;"
1,28,7,"And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddanaram;"
1,28,8,"And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;"
1,28,9,"Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took, besides the wives whom he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife."
1,28,10,"And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran."
1,28,11,"And he came upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep."
1,28,12,"And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it."
1,28,13,"And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said,"
1,28,14,""
1,28,15,""
1,28,16,"And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not."
1,28,17,"And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."
1,28,18,"And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it."
1,28,19,"And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at  first."
1,28,20,"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on,"
1,28,21,"So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:"
1,28,22,"And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that you shall give me I will surely give the tenth unto you."
1,29,1,"Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east."
1,29,2,"And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth."
1,29,3,"And there were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place."
1,29,4,"And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, from where are you? And they said, Of Haran are we."
1,29,5,"And he said unto them, Do you know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him."
1,29,6,"And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter comes with the sheep."
1,29,7,"And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the flocks should be gathered together: water the sheep, and go and feed them."
1,29,8,"And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep."
1,29,9,"And while he yet spoke with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them."
1,29,10,"And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother."
1,29,11,"And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept."
1,29,12,"And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father."
1,29,13,"And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things."
1,29,14,"And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month."
1,29,15,"And Laban said unto Jacob, Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? tell me, what shall your wages be?"
1,29,16,"And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel."
1,29,17,"Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favored."
1,29,18,"And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter."
1,29,19,"And Laban said, It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me."
1,29,20,"And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had for her."
1,29,21,"And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her."
1,29,22,"And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast."
1,29,23,"And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her."
1,29,24,"And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for a handmaid."
1,29,25,"And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this you have done unto me? did not I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"
1,29,26,"And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn."
1,29,27,"Fulfill her week, and we will give you this other also for the service which you shall serve with me yet seven other years."
1,29,28,"And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also."
1,29,29,"And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid."
1,29,30,"And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years."
1,29,31,"And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren."
1,29,32,"And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD has looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me."
1,29,33,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD has heard that I was hated, he has therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon."
1,29,34,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi."
1,29,35,"And she conceived again, and bore a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and ceased bearing."
1,30,1,"And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die."
1,30,2,"And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
1,30,3,"And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her."
1,30,4,"And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid as his wife: and Jacob went in unto her."
1,30,5,"And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son."
1,30,6,"And Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan."
1,30,7,"And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son."
1,30,8,"And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali."
1,30,9,"When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her to Jacob as his wife."
1,30,10,"And Zilpah Leah's maid bore Jacob a son."
1,30,11,"And Leah said, A troop comes: and she called his name Gad."
1,30,12,"And Zilpah Leah's maid bore Jacob a second son."
1,30,13,"And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher."
1,30,14,"And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray you, of your son's mandrakes."
1,30,15,"And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband? and would you take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes."
1,30,16,"And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in unto me; for surely I have hired you with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night."
1,30,17,"And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son."
1,30,18,"And Leah said, God has given me my reward, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar."
1,30,19,"And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son."
1,30,20,"And Leah said, God has endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun."
1,30,21,"And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah."
1,30,22,"And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb."
1,30,23,"And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God has taken away my reproach:"
1,30,24,"And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son."
1,30,25,"And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto my own place, and to my country."
1,30,26,"Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, and let me go: for you know my service which I have done you."
1,30,27,"And Laban said unto him, I pray you, if I have found favor in your eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD has blessed me for your sake."
1,30,28,"And he said, Appoint me your wages, and I will give it."
1,30,29,"And he said unto him, You know how I have served you, and how your cattle were with me."
1,30,30,"For it was little which you had before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD has blessed you since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?"
1,30,31,"And he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me anything: if you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flock."
1,30,32,"I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown lambs among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my wages."
1,30,33,"So shall my honesty answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my wages before your face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me."
1,30,34,"And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to your word."
1,30,35,"And he removed that day the male goats that were striped and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons."
1,30,36,"And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks."
1,30,37,"And Jacob took rods of green poplar, and of the almond and plane tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods."
1,30,38,"And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink."
1,30,39,"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth flocks striped, speckled, and spotted."
1,30,40,"And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban's flock."
1,30,41,"And it came to pass, when the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods."
1,30,42,"But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's."
1,30,43,"And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and donkeys."
1,31,1,"And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's has he gotten all this wealth."
1,31,2,"And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before."
1,31,3,"And the LORD said unto Jacob,"
1,31,4,"And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,"
1,31,5,"And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me."
1,31,6,"And you know that with all my power I have served your father."
1,31,7,"And your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God permitted him not to hurt me."
1,31,8,"If he said thus, The speckled shall be your wages; then all the cattle bore speckled: and if he said thus, The striped shall be your wages; then bore all the flock striped."
1,31,9,"Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me."
1,31,10,"And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the flock were striped, speckled, and spotted."
1,31,11,"And the angel of God spoke unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I."
1,31,12,"And he said, Lift up now your eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are striped, speckled, and spotted: for I have seen all that Laban does unto you."
1,31,13,"I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you vowed a vow unto me: now arise, get you out from this land, and return unto the land of your kindred."
1,31,14,"And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?"
1,31,15,"Are we not counted of him strangers? for he has sold us, and has quite devoured also our money."
1,31,16,"For all the riches which God has taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God has said unto you, do."
1,31,17,"Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;"
1,31,18,"And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Paddanaram, to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan."
1,31,19,"And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's."
1,31,20,"And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Aramean, in that he told him not that he fled."
1,31,21,"So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead."
1,31,22,"And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled."
1,31,23,"And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead."
1,31,24,"And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said unto him,"
1,31,25,"Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mount of Gilead."
1,31,26,"And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?"
1,31,27,"Why did you flee away secretly, and steal from me; and did not tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth, and with songs, with tambourine, and with harp?"
1,31,28,"And have not allowed me to kiss my sons and my daughters? you have now done foolishly in so doing."
1,31,29,"It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke unto me last night, saying, Take heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
1,31,30,"And now, though you would wish to be gone, because you greatly longed after your father's house, yet why have you stolen my gods?"
1,31,31,"And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Perhaps you would take by force your daughters from me."
1,31,32,"With whomever you find your gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern what is yours with me, and take it to you. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them."
1,31,33,"And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent."
1,31,34,"Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not."
1,31,35,"And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before you; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images."
1,31,36,"And Jacob was angry, and upbraided Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued after me?"
1,31,37,"Although you have searched all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? set it here before my brethren and your brethren, that they may judge between us both."
1,31,38,"This twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and the rams of your flock have I not eaten."
1,31,39,"That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto you; I bore the loss of it; of my hand did you require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night."
1,31,40,"Thus I was; in the day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes."
1,31,41,"Thus have I been twenty years in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flocks: and you have changed my wages ten times."
1,31,42,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely you would have sent me away now empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night."
1,31,43,"And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they have borne?"
1,31,44,"Now therefore come, let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be for a witness between me and you."
1,31,45,"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar."
1,31,46,"And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there upon the heap."
1,31,47,"And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed."
1,31,48,"And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and you this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;"
1,31,49,"And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another."
1,31,50,"If you shall afflict my daughters, or if you shall take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and you."
1,31,51,"And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have set between me and you;"
1,31,52,"This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you shall not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm."
1,31,53,"The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac."
1,31,54,"Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount."
1,31,55,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place."
1,32,1,"And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him."
1,32,2,"And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim."
1,32,3,"And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom."
1,32,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall you speak unto my lord Esau; your servant Jacob says thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:"
1,32,5,"And I have oxen, and donkeys, flocks, and menservants, and maidservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in your sight."
1,32,6,"And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and also he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him."
1,32,7,"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;"
1,32,8,"And said, If Esau comes to the one company, and smites it, then the other company which is left shall escape."
1,32,9,"And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who said unto me, Return unto your country, and to your kindred, and I will deal well with you:"
1,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have showed unto your servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two bands."
1,32,11,"Deliver me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children."
1,32,12,"And you said,"
1,32,13,"And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;"
1,32,14,"Two hundred female goats, and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,"
1,32,15,"Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty cows, and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten he-donkeys."
1,32,16,"And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove."
1,32,17,"And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, saying, Whose are you? and where are you going? and whose are these before you?"
1,32,18,"Then you shall say, They are your servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us."
1,32,19,"And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall you speak unto Esau, when you find him."
1,32,20,"And say moreover, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me."
1,32,21,"So the present went over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company."
1,32,22,"And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok."
1,32,23,"And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over all that he had."
1,32,24,"And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day."
1,32,25,"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him."
1,32,26,"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you go, except you bless me."
1,32,27,"And he said unto him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob."
1,32,28,"And he said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince have you power with God and with men, and have prevailed."
1,32,29,"And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray you, your name. And he said, Why is it that you do ask my name? And he blessed him there."
1,32,30,"And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
1,32,31,"And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he limped upon his thigh."
1,32,32,"Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank."
1,33,1,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids."
1,33,2,"And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last."
1,33,3,"And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother."
1,33,4,"And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept."
1,33,5,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with you? And he said, The children which God has graciously given your servant."
1,33,6,"Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves."
1,33,7,"And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and last came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves."
1,33,8,"And he said, What mean you by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord."
1,33,9,"And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what you have unto yourself."
1,33,10,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray you, if now I have found grace in your sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen your face, as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me."
1,33,11,"Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it."
1,33,12,"And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you."
1,33,13,"And he said unto him, My lord knows that the children are frail, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die."
1,33,14,"Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on slowly, according as the flocks that go before me and the children are able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir."
1,33,15,"And Esau said, Let me now leave with you some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What need is there? let me find grace in the sight of my lord."
1,33,16,"So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir."
1,33,17,"And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth."
1,33,18,"And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddanaram; and pitched his tent before the city."
1,33,19,"And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money."
1,33,20,"And he erected there an altar, and called it Elelohe-israel."
1,34,1,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bore unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land."
1,34,2,"And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her."
1,34,3,"And his soul clung unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly unto the damsel."
1,34,4,"And Shechem spoke unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel for my wife."
1,34,5,"And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come."
1,34,6,"And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to speak with him."
1,34,7,"And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done."
1,34,8,"And Hamor spoke with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter: I pray you give her to him for a wife."
1,34,9,"And make marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you."
1,34,10,"And you shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade in it, and get possessions in it."
1,34,11,"And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what you shall say unto me I will give."
1,34,12,"Ask me ever so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as you shall say unto me: but give me the damsel for my wife."
1,34,13,"And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:"
1,34,14,"And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that would be a reproach unto us:"
1,34,15,"But in this will we consent unto you: If you will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;"
1,34,16,"Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people."
1,34,17,"But if you will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone."
1,34,18,"And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son."
1,34,19,"And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father."
1,34,20,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying,"
1,34,21,"These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters."
1,34,22,"Only in this will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised."
1,34,23,"Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us."
1,34,24,"And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city."
1,34,25,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males."
1,34,26,"And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out."
1,34,27,"The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister."
1,34,28,"They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their donkeys, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,"
1,34,29,"And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house."
1,34,30,"And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me to make me repulsive among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house."
1,34,31,"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?"
1,35,1,"And God said unto Jacob,"
1,35,2,"Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:"
1,35,3,"And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
1,35,4,"And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem."
1,35,5,"And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob."
1,35,6,"So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him."
1,35,7,"And he built there an altar, and called the place El-bethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother."
1,35,8,"But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbacuth."
1,35,9,"And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Paddanaram, and blessed him."
1,35,10,"And God said unto him,"
1,35,11,"And God said unto him,"
1,35,12,""
1,35,13,"And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him."
1,35,14,"And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon."
1,35,15,"And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel."
1,35,16,"And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor."
1,35,17,"And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; you shall have this son also."
1,35,18,"And it came to pass, as her soul was departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin."
1,35,19,"And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem."
1,35,20,"And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day."
1,35,21,"And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder."
1,35,22,"And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:"
1,35,23,"The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:"
1,35,24,"The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:"
1,35,25,"And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:"
1,35,26,"And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddanaram."
1,35,27,"And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned."
1,35,28,"And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years."
1,35,29,"And Isaac breathed his last, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him."
1,36,1,"Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom."
1,36,2,"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;"
1,36,3,"And Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth."
1,36,4,"And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bore Reuel;"
1,36,5,"And Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, who were born unto him in the land of Canaan."
1,36,6,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob."
1,36,7,"For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land in which they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle."
1,36,8,"Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom."
1,36,9,"And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:"
1,36,10,"These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau."
1,36,11,"And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz."
1,36,12,"And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife."
1,36,13,"And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Basemath Esau's wife."
1,36,14,"And these were the sons of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bore to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah."
1,36,15,"These were chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,"
1,36,16,"Chief Korah, chief Gatam, and chief Amalek: these are the chiefs that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah."
1,36,17,"And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath Esau's wife."
1,36,18,"And these are the sons of Oholibamah Esau's wife; chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah: these were the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife."
1,36,19,"These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their chiefs."
1,36,20,"These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,"
1,36,21,"And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the chiefs of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom."
1,36,22,"And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna."
1,36,23,"And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam."
1,36,24,"And these are the children of Zibeon; both Aiah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father."
1,36,25,"And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah."
1,36,26,"And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran."
1,36,27,"The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan."
1,36,28,"The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran."
1,36,29,"These are the chiefs that came of the Horites; chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,"
1,36,30,"Chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of Hori, among their chiefs in the land of Seir."
1,36,31,"And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel."
1,36,32,"And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah."
1,36,33,"And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead."
1,36,34,"And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead."
1,36,35,"And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith."
1,36,36,"And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead."
1,36,37,"And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead."
1,36,38,"And Shaul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead."
1,36,39,"And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab."
1,36,40,"And these are the names of the chiefs that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; chief Timnah, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,"
1,36,41,"Chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,"
1,36,42,"Chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,"
1,36,43,"Chief Magdiel, chief Iram: these are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites."
1,37,1,"And Jacob dwelt in the land in which his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan."
1,37,2,"These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report."
1,37,3,"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors."
1,37,4,"And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him."
1,37,5,"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers: and they hated him yet the more."
1,37,6,"And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:"
1,37,7,"For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and bowed down to my sheaf."
1,37,8,"And his brothers said to him, Shall you indeed reign over us? or shall you indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words."
1,37,9,"And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, Behold, I have dreamed another dream; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars bowed down to me."
1,37,10,"And he told it to his father, and to his brothers: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to you to the earth?"
1,37,11,"And his brothers envied him; but his father observed the saying."
1,37,12,"And his brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem."
1,37,13,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not your brothers feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send you unto them. And he said to him, Here am I."
1,37,14,"And he said to him, Go, I pray you, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem."
1,37,15,"And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seek you?"
1,37,16,"And he said, I seek my brothers: tell me, I pray you, where they feed their flocks."
1,37,17,"And the man said, They are departed from here; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan."
1,37,18,"And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him."
1,37,19,"And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer comes."
1,37,20,"Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast has devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams."
1,37,21,"And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him."
1,37,22,"And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again."
1,37,23,"And it came to pass, when Joseph came unto his brothers, that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him;"
1,37,24,"And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it."
1,37,25,"And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt."
1,37,26,"And Judah said unto his brothers, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?"
1,37,27,"Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brothers were content."
1,37,28,"Then there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt."
1,37,29,"And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he tore his clothes."
1,37,30,"And he returned unto his brothers, and said, The child is not; and I, where shall I go?"
1,37,31,"And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;"
1,37,32,"And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: see now whether it be your son's coat or not."
1,37,33,"And he recognized it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces."
1,37,34,"And Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days."
1,37,35,"And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him."
1,37,36,"And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard."
1,38,1,"And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah."
1,38,2,"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in unto her."
1,38,3,"And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er."
1,38,4,"And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan."
1,38,5,"And she yet again conceived, and bore a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him."
1,38,6,"And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar."
1,38,7,"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him."
1,38,8,"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto your brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up descendants to your brother."
1,38,9,"And Onan knew that the descendant would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give a descendant to his brother."
1,38,10,"And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: therefore he slew him also."
1,38,11,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at your father's house, till Shelah my son is grown: for he said, Lest perhaps he die also, as his brothers did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house."
1,38,12,"And in process of time the daughter of Shua Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite."
1,38,13,"And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold your father-in-law goes up to Timnah to shear his sheep."
1,38,14,"And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him as wife."
1,38,15,"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; because she had covered her face."
1,38,16,"And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray you, let me come in unto you; (for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law.) And she said, What will you give me, that you may come in unto me?"
1,38,17,"And he said, I will send you a kid from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?"
1,38,18,"And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your signet, and your bracelets, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave it to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him."
1,38,19,"And she arose, and went away, and laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood."
1,38,20,"And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not."
1,38,21,"Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the wayside? And they said, There was no harlot in this place."
1,38,22,"And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, There was no harlot in this place."
1,38,23,"And Judah said, Let her keep it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and you have not found her."
1,38,24,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by harlotry. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."
1,38,25,"When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray you, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff."
1,38,26,"And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She has been more righteous than I; because I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more."
1,38,27,"And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb."
1,38,28,"And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first."
1,38,29,"And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How have you broken forth? this breach be upon you: therefore his name was called Perez."
1,38,30,"And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerah."
1,39,1,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down there."
1,39,2,"And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian."
1,39,3,"And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand."
1,39,4,"And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand."
1,39,5,"And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field."
1,39,6,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not anything he had, except the food which he did eat. And Joseph was a handsome person, and well favored."
1,39,7,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me."
1,39,8,"But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master knows not what is with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my hand;"
1,39,9,"There is none greater in this house than I; neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
1,39,10,"And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her."
1,39,11,"And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within."
1,39,12,"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got out."
1,39,13,"And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,"
1,39,14,"That she called unto the men of her house, and spoke unto them, saying, See, he has brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:"
1,39,15,"And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got out."
1,39,16,"And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home."
1,39,17,"And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which you have brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:"
1,39,18,"And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out."
1,39,19,"And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying, After this manner did your servant to me; that his wrath was kindled."
1,39,20,"And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison."
1,39,21,"But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison."
1,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it."
1,39,23,"The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper."
1,40,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt."
1,40,2,"And Pharaoh was angry against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers."
1,40,3,"And he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound."
1,40,4,"And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued    awhile in custody."
1,40,5,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison."
1,40,6,"And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad."
1,40,7,"And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in custody in his lord's house, saying, Why do you look so sad today?"
1,40,8,"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you."
1,40,9,"And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;"
1,40,10,"And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:"
1,40,11,"And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
1,40,12,"And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:"
1,40,13,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head, and restore you unto your place: and you shall deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when you were his butler."
1,40,14,"But think of me when it shall be well with you, and show kindness, I pray you, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:"
1,40,15,"For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."
1,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:"
1,40,17,"And in the uppermost basket there was all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head."
1,40,18,"And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:"
1,40,19,"Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head from off you, and shall hang you on a tree; and the birds shall eat your flesh from off you."
1,40,20,"And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants."
1,40,21,"And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:"
1,40,22,"But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them."
1,40,23,"Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgot him."
1,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river."
1,41,2,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favored cows and fat; and they fed in a meadow."
1,41,3,"And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill favored and thin; and stood by the other cows upon the bank of the river."
1,41,4,"And the ill favored and thin cows did eat up the seven well favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke."
1,41,5,"And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, full and good."
1,41,6,"And, behold, seven thin ears and dried by the east wind sprung up after them."
1,41,7,"And the seven thin ears devoured the seven healthy and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream."
1,41,8,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dreams; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh."
1,41,9,"Then spoke the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:"
1,41,10,"Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:"
1,41,11,"And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream."
1,41,12,"And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret."
1,41,13,"And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto my office, and him he hanged."
1,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his clothes, and came in unto Pharaoh."
1,41,15,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of you, that you can understand a dream to interpret it."
1,41,16,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
1,41,17,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:"
1,41,18,"And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat and well favored; and they fed in a meadow:"
1,41,19,"And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill favored and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:"
1,41,20,"And the thin and the ill favored cows did eat up the first seven fat cows:"
1,41,21,"And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke."
1,41,22,"And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good:"
1,41,23,"And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and dried by the east wind, sprung up after them:"
1,41,24,"And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me."
1,41,25,"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God has showed Pharaoh what he is about to do."
1,41,26,"The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one."
1,41,27,"And the seven thin and ill favored cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears dried by the east wind shall be seven years of famine."
1,41,28,"This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he shows unto Pharaoh."
1,41,29,"Behold, there comes seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:"
1,41,30,"And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;"
1,41,31,"And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous."
1,41,32,"And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass."
1,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh seek out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt."
1,41,34,"Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years."
1,41,35,"And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities."
1,41,36,"And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine."
1,41,37,"And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants."
1,41,38,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?"
1,41,39,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Since God has showed you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are:"
1,41,40,"You shall be over my house, and according unto your word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than you."
1,41,41,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."
1,41,42,"And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in clothing of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;"
1,41,43,"And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt."
1,41,44,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
1,41,45,"And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenathpaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt."
1,41,46,"And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt."
1,41,47,"And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls."
1,41,48,"And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same."
1,41,49,"And Joseph gathered grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he quit numbering; for it was without number."
1,41,50,"And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On bore unto him."
1,41,51,"And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."
1,41,52,"And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction."
1,41,53,"And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended."
1,41,54,"And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the famine was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread."
1,41,55,"And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he says to you, do."
1,41,56,"And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was severe in the land of Egypt."
1,41,57,"And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain; because that the famine was so severe in all lands."
1,42,1,"Now when Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do you look one upon another?"
1,42,2,"And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down there, and buy for us from there; that we may live, and not die."
1,42,3,"And Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt."
1,42,4,"But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brothers; for he said, Lest perhaps mischief befall him."
1,42,5,"And the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan."
1,42,6,"And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brothers came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth."
1,42,7,"And Joseph saw his brothers, and he knew them, but made himself unknown unto them, and spoke roughly unto them; and he said unto them, from where do you come? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food."
1,42,8,"And Joseph knew his brothers, but they knew not him."
1,42,9,"And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, You are spies; to see the nakedness of the land you are come."
1,42,10,"And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are your servants come."
1,42,11,"We are all one man's sons; we are honest men, your servants are no spies."
1,42,12,"And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land you are come."
1,42,13,"And they said, Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not."
1,42,14,"And Joseph said unto them, It is as I spoke unto you, saying, You are spies:"
1,42,15,"Hereby you shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh you shall not go forth from here, except your youngest brother come here."
1,42,16,"Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies."
1,42,17,"And he put them all together into custody three days."
1,42,18,"And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:"
1,42,19,"If you be true men, let one of your brothers be bound in the house of your prison: go, carry grain for the famine of your houses:"
1,42,20,"But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and you shall not die. And they did so."
1,42,21,"And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us."
1,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Spoke I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and you would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required."
1,42,23,"And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spoke unto them by an interpreter."
1,42,24,"And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and spoke with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes."
1,42,25,"Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with grain, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them."
1,42,26,"And they loaded their donkeys with the grain, and departed there."
1,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey provender in the inn, he saw his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth."
1,42,28,"And he said unto his brothers, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their hearts failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God has done unto us?"
1,42,29,"And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell them; saying,"
1,42,30,"The man, who is the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country."
1,42,31,"And we said unto him, We are honest men; we are no spies:"
1,42,32,"We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
1,42,33,"And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that you are honest men; leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:"
1,42,34,"And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that you are no spies, but that you are honest men: so will I deliver you your brother, and you shall trade in the land."
1,42,35,"And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid."
1,42,36,"And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have you bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me."
1,42,37,"And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to you: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to you again."
1,42,38,"And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in which you go, then shall you bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
1,43,1,"And the famine was severe in the land."
1,43,2,"And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food."
1,43,3,"And Judah spoke unto him, saying, The man did solemnly warn unto us, saying, You shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
1,43,4,"If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food:"
1,43,5,"But if you will not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, You shall not see my face, except your brother be with you."
1,43,6,"And Israel said, Why dealt you so ill with me, as to tell the man whether you had yet a brother?"
1,43,7,"And they said, The man asked us carefully of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have you another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any way know that he would say, Bring your brother down?"
1,43,8,"And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones."
1,43,9,"I will be surety for him; of my hand shall you require him: if I bring him not unto you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever:"
1,43,10,"For except we had lingered, surely now we would have returned this second time."
1,43,11,"And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:"
1,43,12,"And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; perhaps it was an oversight:"
1,43,13,"Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:"
1,43,14,"And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
1,43,15,"And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph."
1,43,16,"And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay an animal, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon."
1,43,17,"And the man did as Joseph bade him; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house."
1,43,18,"And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for slaves, and our donkeys."
1,43,19,"And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke with him at the door of the house,"
1,43,20,"And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:"
1,43,21,"And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand."
1,43,22,"And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks."
1,43,23,"And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them."
1,43,24,"And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys provender."
1,43,25,"And they made ready the present for Josephâ€™s coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there."
1,43,26,"And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth."
1,43,27,"And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?"
1,43,28,"And they answered, Your servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and paid him honor."
1,43,29,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom you spoke unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto you, my son."
1,43,30,"And Joseph made haste; for his heart did yearn over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there."
1,43,31,"And he washed his face, and went out, and controlled himself, and said, Serve the food."
1,43,32,"And they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, who did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
1,43,33,"And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one at another."
1,43,34,"And he took and sent portions unto them from before him: but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him."
1,44,1,"And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth."
1,44,2,"And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken."
1,44,3,"As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys."
1,44,4,"And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when you do overtake them, say unto them, Why have you rewarded evil for good?"
1,44,5,"Is not this it from which my lord drinks, and by which indeed he divines? you have done evil in so doing."
1,44,6,"And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these same words."
1,44,7,"And they said unto him, Why says my lord these words? God forbid that your servants should do according to this thing:"
1,44,8,"Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto you out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of your lord's house silver or gold?"
1,44,9,"With whomever of your servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's slaves."
1,44,10,"And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and you shall be blameless."
1,44,11,"Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack."
1,44,12,"And he searched, and began at the eldest, and ended at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack."
1,44,13,"Then they tore their clothes, and loaded every man his donkey, and returned to the city."
1,44,14,"And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground."
1,44,15,"And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that you have done? Know you not that such a man as I can certainly divine?"
1,44,16,"And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found."
1,44,17,"And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father."
1,44,18,"Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant: for you are even as Pharaoh."
1,44,19,"My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you a father, or a brother?"
1,44,20,"And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him."
1,44,21,"And you said unto your servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set my eyes upon him."
1,44,22,"And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die."
1,44,23,"And you said unto your servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, you shall see my face no more."
1,44,24,"And it came to pass when we came up unto your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord."
1,44,25,"And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food."
1,44,26,"And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us."
1,44,27,"And your servant my father said unto us, You know that my wife bore me two sons:"
1,44,28,"And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:"
1,44,29,"And if you take this also from me, and mischief befall him, you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."
1,44,30,"Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;"
1,44,31,"It shall come to pass, when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and your servants shall bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave."
1,44,32,"For your servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto you, then I shall bear the blame to my father forever."
1,44,33,"Now therefore, I pray you, let your servant abide instead of the lad a slave to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brothers."
1,44,34,"For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father."
1,45,1,"Then Joseph could not control himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brothers."
1,45,2,"And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard."
1,45,3,"And Joseph said unto his brothers, I am Joseph; does my father yet live? And his brothers could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence."
1,45,4,"And Joseph said unto his brothers, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt."
1,45,5,"Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here: for God did send me before you to preserve life."
1,45,6,"For these two years has the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in the which there shall neither be plowing nor harvest."
1,45,7,"And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance."
1,45,8,"So now it was not you that sent me here, but God: and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt."
1,45,9,"Haste you, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:"
1,45,10,"And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near unto me, you, and your children, and your children's children, and your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have:"
1,45,11,"And there will I nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine; lest you, and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty."
1,45,12,"And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks unto you."
1,45,13,"And you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen; and you shall haste and bring down my father here."
1,45,14,"And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck."
1,45,15,"Moreover he kissed all his brothers, and wept upon them: and after that his brothers talked with him."
1,45,16,"And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants."
1,45,17,"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto your brothers, This do you; load your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;"
1,45,18,"And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land."
1,45,19,"Now you are commanded, this do you; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come."
1,45,20,"Also regard not your goods; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours."
1,45,21,"And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way."
1,45,22,"To all of them he gave each man changes of clothing; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of clothing."
1,45,23,"And to his father he sent after this manner; ten donkeys laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-donkeys laden with grain and bread and food for his father by the way."
1,45,24,"So he sent his brothers away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that you fall not out by the way."
1,45,25,"And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,"
1,45,26,"And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not."
1,45,27,"And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:"
1,45,28,"And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die."
1,46,1,"And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac."
1,46,2,"And God spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,"
1,46,3,"And he said,"
1,46,4,""
1,46,5,"And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him."
1,46,6,"And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his descendants with him:"
1,46,7,"His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his descendants brought he with him into Egypt."
1,46,8,"And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn."
1,46,9,"And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi."
1,46,10,"And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman."
1,46,11,"And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
1,46,12,"And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul."
1,46,13,"And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron."
1,46,14,"And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel."
1,46,15,"These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore unto Jacob in Paddanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three."
1,46,16,"And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli."
1,46,17,"And the sons of Asher; Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel."
1,46,18,"These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bore unto Jacob, even sixteen souls."
1,46,19,"The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin."
1,46,20,"And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On bore unto him."
1,46,21,"And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard."
1,46,22,"These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen."
1,46,23,"And the sons of Dan; Hushim."
1,46,24,"And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem."
1,46,25,"These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bore these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven."
1,46,26,"All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, who were his direct offspring, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were three score and six;"
1,46,27,"And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were three score and ten."
1,46,28,"And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen."
1,46,29,"And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while."
1,46,30,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are yet alive."
1,46,31,"And Joseph said unto his brothers, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brothers, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;"
1,46,32,"And the men are shepherds, for their trade has been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have."
1,46,33,"And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?"
1,46,34,"That you shall say, Your servants' trade has been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians."
1,47,1,"Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
1,47,2,"And he took some of his brothers, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh."
1,47,3,"And Pharaoh said unto his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers."
1,47,4,"They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for your servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray you, let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
1,47,5,"And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers are come unto you:"
1,47,6,"The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land make your father and brothers to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if you know any men of ability among them, then make them rulers over my cattle."
1,47,7,"And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh."
1,47,8,"And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old are you?"
1,47,9,"And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage."
1,47,10,"And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh."
1,47,11,"And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded."
1,47,12,"And Joseph nourished his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household, with food, according to their families."
1,47,13,"And there was no food in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine."
1,47,14,"And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house."
1,47,15,"And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us food: for why should we die in your presence? for the money fails."
1,47,16,"And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you food for your cattle, if money fails;."
1,47,17,"And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them food in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with food for all their cattle for that year."
1,47,18,"When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also has our herds of cattle; there is not anything left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:"
1,47,19,"Why shall we die before your eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for food, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate."
1,47,20,"And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's."
1,47,21,"And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof."
1,47,22,"Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: therefore they sold not their lands."
1,47,23,"Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land."
1,47,24,"And it shall come to pass in the harvest, that you shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
1,47,25,"And they said, You have saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
1,47,26,"And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's."
1,47,27,"And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly."
1,47,28,"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred forty and seven years."
1,47,29,"And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray you, in Egypt:"
1,47,30,"But I will lie with my fathers, and you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place. And he said, I will do as you have said."
1,47,31,"And he said, Swear unto me. And he swore unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed."
1,48,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, your father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim."
1,48,2,"And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, your son Joseph comes unto you: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed."
1,48,3,"And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,"
1,48,4,"And said unto me, Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people; and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession."
1,48,5,"And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born unto you in the land of Egypt before I came unto you into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine."
1,48,6,"And your offspring, which you begat after them, shall be yours, and shall be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance."
1,48,7,"And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem."
1,48,8,"And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?"
1,48,9,"And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray you, unto me, and I will bless them."
1,48,10,"Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them."
1,48,11,"And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see your face: and, lo, God has showed me also your descendants."
1,48,12,"And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth."
1,48,13,"And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him."
1,48,14,"And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands knowingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn."
1,48,15,"And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who fed me all my life long unto this day,"
1,48,16,"The Angel who redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be perpetuated in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
1,48,17,"And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head."
1,48,18,"And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put your right hand upon his head."
1,48,19,"And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations."
1,48,20,"And he blessed them that day, saying, In you shall Israel bless, saying, God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh."
1,48,21,"And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers."
1,48,22,"Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."
1,49,1,"And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days."
1,49,2,"Gather yourselves together, and hear, you sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father."
1,49,3,"Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:"
1,49,4,"Unstable as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father's bed; then you defiled it: he went up to my couch."
1,49,5,"Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations."
1,49,6,"O my soul, come not into their secret; unto their assembly, my spirit, be not united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they dug down a wall."
1,49,7,"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel."
1,49,8,"Judah, you are he whom your brothers shall praise: your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your father's children shall bow down before you."
1,49,9,"Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, you are gone up: he stooped down, he crouched as a lion, and as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?"

1,50,5,"My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have dug for me in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father, and I will come again."
1,50,6,"And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury your father, according as he made you swear."
1,50,7,"And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,"

1,50,11,"And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the threshing floor of Atad, they said, This is a mourning to the Egyptians: therefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan."
1,50,12,"And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:"
1,50,13,"For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying place from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre."
1,50,14,"And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father."
1,50,15,"And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will perhaps hate us, and will certainly pay back to us all the evil which we did unto him."
1,50,16,"And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Your father did command before he died, saying,"
1,50,17,"So shall you say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray you now, the trespass of your brothers, and their sin; for they did unto you evil: and now, we pray you, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke unto him."
1,50,18,"And his brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are your servants."
1,50,19,"And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?"
1,50,20,"But as for you, you thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive."
1,50,21,"Now therefore fear not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly unto them."
1,50,22,"And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years."
1,50,23,"And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees."
1,50,24,"And Joseph said unto his brothers, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
1,50,25,"And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here."
1,50,26,"So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
2,1,1,"Now these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob."
2,1,2,"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,"
2,1,3,"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,"
2,1,4,"Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher."
2,1,5,"And all persons that were direct offspring of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already."
2,1,6,"And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation."
2,1,7,"And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them."
2,1,8,"Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph."
2,1,9,"And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:"
2,1,10,"Come, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there come upon us any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so escape out of the land."
2,1,11,"Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses."
2,1,12,"But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel."
2,1,13,"And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:"
2,1,14,"And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, in which they made them serve, was with rigor."
2,1,15,"And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:"
2,1,16,"And he said, When you serve as a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then you shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live."
2,1,17,"But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive."
2,1,18,"And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have you done this thing, and have saved the male children alive?"
2,1,19,"And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and are delivered before the midwives come in unto them."
2,1,20,"Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty."
2,1,21,"And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he gave them families."
2,1,22,"And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive."
2,2,1,"And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi."
2,2,2,"And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a fine child, she hid him three months."
2,2,3,"And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with tar and with pitch, and put the child in it; and she laid it among the reeds by the river's bank."
2,2,4,"And his sister stood far off, to know what would be done to him."
2,2,5,"And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maid to get it."
2,2,6,"And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children."
2,2,7,"Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to you a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?"
2,2,8,"And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and called the child's mother."
2,2,9,"And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it."
2,2,10,"And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water."
2,2,11,"And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren."
2,2,12,"And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand."
2,2,13,"And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why strike you your fellow?"
2,2,14,"And he said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? do you intend to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known."
2,2,15,"Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well."
2,2,16,"Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock."
2,2,17,"And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock."
2,2,18,"And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you are come so soon today?"
2,2,19,"And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock."
2,2,20,"And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that you have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread."
2,2,21,"And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter."
2,2,22,"And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land."
2,2,23,"And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaned by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage."
2,2,24,"And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob."
2,2,25,"And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had concern for them."
2,3,1,"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the west side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb."
2,3,2,"And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed."
2,3,3,"And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
2,3,4,"And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,"

2,16,14,"And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground."
2,16,15,"And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat."
2,16,16,"This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take every man for them who are in his tents."
2,16,17,"And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less."
2,16,18,"And when they did measure it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating."
2,16,19,"And Moses said, Let no man leave any of it till the morning."
2,16,20,"But they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left some of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was angry with them."
2,16,21,"And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun grew hot, it melted."
2,16,22,"And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses."
2,16,23,"And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD has said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which you will bake today, and boil that which you will boil; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning."
2,16,24,"And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm in it."
2,16,25,"And Moses said, Eat that today; for today is a sabbath unto the LORD: today you shall not find it in the field."
2,16,26,"Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none."
2,16,27,"And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day to gather, and they found none."
2,16,28,"And the LORD said unto Moses,"

2,16,30,"So the people rested on the seventh day."
2,16,31,"And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey."
2,16,32,"And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commands, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread with which I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt."
2,16,33,"And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna in it, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations."
2,16,34,"As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept."
2,16,35,"And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the border of the land of Canaan."
2,16,36,"Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah."
2,17,1,"And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink."
2,17,2,"Therefore the people did strive with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why do you strive with me? why do you test the LORD?"
2,17,3,"And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why is this that you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?"
2,17,4,"And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they are almost ready to stone me."
2,17,5,"And the LORD said unto Moses,"
2,17,6,""
2,17,7,"And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?"
2,17,8,"Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim."
2,17,9,"And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand."
2,17,10,"So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill."
2,17,11,"And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed."
2,17,12,"But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun."
2,17,13,"And Joshua slaughtered Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword."
2,17,14,"And the LORD said unto Moses,"
2,17,15,"And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it, The LORD is my banner:"
2,17,16,"For he said, Because the LORD has sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation."
2,18,1,"When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;"
2,18,2,"Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,"
2,18,3,"And her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land:"
2,18,4,"And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:"
2,18,5,"And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:"
2,18,6,"And he said unto Moses, I your father-in-law Jethro am come unto you, and your wife, and her two sons with her."
2,18,7,"And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent."
2,18,8,"And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them."
2,18,9,"And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians."
2,18,10,"And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians."
2,18,11,"Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing in which they dealt proudly he was above them."
2,18,12,"And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God."
2,18,13,"And it came to pass on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening."
2,18,14,"And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that you do to the people? why sit you yourself alone, and all the people stand by you from morning unto evening?"
2,18,15,"And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:"
2,18,16,"When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws."
2,18,17,"And Moses' father-in-law said unto him, The thing that you do is not good."
2,18,18,"You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you: for this thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it yourself alone."
2,18,19,"Hearken now unto my voice, I will give you counsel, and God shall be with you: Represent the people before God, that you may bring the causes unto God:"
2,18,20,"And you shall teach them ordinances and laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do."
2,18,21,"Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:"
2,18,22,"And let them judge the people at all times: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto you, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for yourself, and they shall bear the burden with you."
2,18,23,"If you shall do this thing, and God command you so, then you shall be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace."
2,18,24,"So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said."
2,18,25,"And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens."
2,18,26,"And they judged the people at all times: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves."
2,18,27,"And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land."
2,19,1,"In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai."
2,19,2,"For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had camped in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount."

2,19,17,"And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the lower part of the mount."
2,19,18,"And mount Sinai was completely in smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly."
2,19,19,"And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice."

2,38,23,"And with him was Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen."
2,38,24,"All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary."
2,38,25,"And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and three score and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:"
2,38,26,"A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men."
2,38,27,"And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil; a hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket."
2,38,28,"And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and banded them."
2,38,29,"And the bronze of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels."
2,38,30,"And with it he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and the bronze altar, and the bronze grate for it, and all the utensils of the altar,"
2,38,31,"And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about."
2,39,1,"And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,39,2,"And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen."
2,39,3,"And they did hammer the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with skillful work."
2,39,4,"They made shoulder pieces for it, to join it together: by the two edges was it joined together."
2,39,5,"And the skillfully woven band of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same workmanship, according to its work; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,39,6,"And they worked onyx stones enclosed in settings of gold, engraved, as signets are engraved, with the names of the children of Israel."
2,39,7,"And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,39,8,"And he made the breastplate of skillful work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen."
2,39,9,"It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length of it, and a span the breadth of it, being doubled."
2,39,10,"And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row."
2,39,11,"And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond."
2,39,12,"And the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst."
2,39,13,"And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were enclosed in settings of gold in their mountings."
2,39,14,"And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with its name, according to the twelve tribes."
2,39,15,"And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of braided work of pure gold."
2,39,16,"And they made two settings of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate."
2,39,17,"And they put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate."
2,39,18,"And the two ends of the two braided chains they fastened to the two settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, in the front."
2,39,19,"And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, in its edge, which was on the inside of the ephod."
2,39,20,"And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the front of it, right at the seam, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod."
2,39,21,"And they did bind the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not come loose from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,39,22,"And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue."
2,39,23,"And there was a hole in the top of the robe, as the hole of a garment, with a band round about the hole, that it should not tear."
2,39,24,"And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen."
2,39,25,"And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates on the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;"
2,39,26,"A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,39,27,"And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,"
2,39,28,"And a turban of fine linen, and exquisite caps of fine linen, and linen trousers of fine twined linen,"
2,39,29,"And a band of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,39,30,"And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD."
2,39,31,"And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it high on the turban; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,39,32,"Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they."
2,39,33,"And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets,"
2,39,34,"And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the veil of the covering,"
2,39,35,"The ark of the testimony, and its poles, and the mercy seat,"
2,39,36,"The table, and all the utensils, and the showbread,"
2,39,37,"The pure lampstand, with its lamps, even with the lamps set in order, and all its utensils, and the oil for light,"
2,39,38,"And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet-smelling incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,"
2,39,39,"The bronze altar, and its grate of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils, the laver and its base,"
2,39,40,"The hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, its cords, and its pins, and all the utensils of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,"
2,39,41,"The garments of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office."
2,39,42,"According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work."
2,39,43,"And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them."

2,40,18,"And Moses raised up the tabernacle, and fastened its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and raised up its pillars."
2,40,19,"And he spread out the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent over it; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,40,20,"And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark:"

2,40,23,"And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses."

2,40,28,"And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle."
2,40,29,"And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the grain offering; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,40,30,"And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, for washing."
2,40,31,"And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet there:"
2,40,32,"When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses."
2,40,33,"And he raised up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work."
2,40,34,"Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
2,40,35,"And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
2,40,36,"And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:"
2,40,37,"But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up."
2,40,38,"For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys."

3,10,14,"And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall you eat in a clean place; you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are your due, and your sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel."
3,10,15,"The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be yours, and your sons' with you, by a statute forever; as the LORD has commanded."
3,10,16,"And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left alive, saying,"
3,10,17,"Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?"
3,10,18,"Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: you should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded."
3,10,19,"And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering today, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?"

5,3,3,"So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we struck him until none was left to him remaining."
5,3,4,"And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, three score cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
5,3,5,"All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides unwalled towns a great many."
5,3,6,"And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city."
5,3,7,"But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves."
5,3,8,"And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side of Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;"
5,3,9,"(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Senir;)"
5,3,10,"All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan."
5,3,11,"For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man."
5,3,12,"And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half the mountains of Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites."
5,3,13,"And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants."
5,3,14,"Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day."
5,3,15,"And I gave Gilead unto Machir."
5,3,16,"And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;"
5,3,17,"The plain also, with the Jordan as the border thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east."
5,3,18,"And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it: you shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are fit for war."
5,3,19,"But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that you have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;"
5,3,20,"Until the LORD has given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God has given them beyond the Jordan: and then shall you return every man unto his possession, which I have given you."
5,3,21,"And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms through which you pass."
5,3,22,"You shall not fear them: for the LORD your God, he shall fight for you."
5,3,23,"And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,"
5,3,24,"O Lord GOD, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your might?"
5,3,25,"I pray you, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that pleasant mountain, and Lebanon."
5,3,26,"But the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me,"

5,3,28,""
5,3,29,"So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor."
5,4,1,"Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, to do them, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers gives you."
5,4,2,"You shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall you take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you."
5,4,3,"Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD your God has destroyed them from among you."
5,4,4,"But you that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day."
5,4,5,"Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do so in the land where you go to possess it."
5,4,6,"Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people."
5,4,7,"For what nation is there so great, that has God so near unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?"
5,4,8,"And what nation is there so great, that has statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?"
5,4,9,"Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life: but teach them to your sons, and your sons' sons;"
5,4,10,"Especially the day that you stood before the LORD your God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me,"
5,4,11,"And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness."
5,4,12,"And the LORD spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no form; only you heard a voice."
5,4,13,"And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone."
5,4,14,"And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it."
5,4,15,"Take therefore good heed unto yourselves; for you saw no manner of form on the day that the LORD spoke unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:"
5,4,16,"Lest you corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,"
5,4,17,"The likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flies in the air,"
5,4,18,"The likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:"
5,4,19,"And lest you lift up your eyes unto heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has apportioned unto all nations under the whole heaven."
5,4,20,"But the LORD has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as you are this day."
5,4,21,"Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance:"
5,4,22,"But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but you shall go over, and possess that good land."
5,4,23,"Take heed unto yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of anything, which the LORD your God has forbidden you."
5,4,24,"For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God."
5,4,25,"When you shall beget children, and children's children, and you shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of anything, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD your God, to provoke him to anger:"
5,4,26,"I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land which you go over Jordan to possess; you shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed."
5,4,27,"And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and you shall be left few in number among the nations, where the LORD shall lead you."
5,4,28,"And there you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell."
5,4,29,"But if from there you shall seek the LORD your God, you shall find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul."
5,4,30,"When you are in tribulation, and all these things are come upon you, even in the latter days, if you turn to the LORD your God, and shall be obedient unto his voice;"
5,4,31,"(For the LORD your God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore unto them."
5,4,32,"For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has been heard anything like it?"
5,4,33,"Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?"
5,4,34,"Or has God ever ventured to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?"
5,4,35,"Unto you it was shown, that you might know that the LORD he is God; there is none else besides him."
5,4,36,"Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and upon earth he showed you his great fire; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire."
5,4,37,"And because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their descendants after them, and brought you out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;"
5,4,38,"To drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you are, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day."
5,4,39,"Know therefore this day, and consider it in your heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else."
5,4,40,"You shall keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days upon the earth, which the LORD your God gives you, forever."
5,4,41,"Then Moses set apart three cities on this side of Jordan toward the sun rising;"
5,4,42,"That the slayer might flee there, who should kill his neighbor unintentionally, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:"
5,4,43,"Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites."
5,4,44,"And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:"
5,4,45,"These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt,"
5,4,46,"On this side of Jordan, in the valley opposite Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel defeated, after they were come forth out of Egypt:"
5,4,47,"And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who were on this side of Jordan toward the sun rising;"
5,4,48,"From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon,"
5,4,49,"And all the plain on this side of Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, below the slopes of Pisgah."

5,9,20,"And the LORD was very angry with Aaron and would have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time."
5,9,21,"And I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust of it into the brook that descended out of the mount."
5,9,22,"And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, you provoked the LORD to wrath."
5,9,23,"Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying,"
5,9,24,"You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you."
5,9,25,"Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you."
5,9,26,"I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not your people and your inheritance, which you have redeemed through your greatness, which you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand."
5,9,27,"Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:"
5,9,28,"Lest the land from which you brought us out should say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness."
5,9,29,"Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your mighty power and by your outstretched arm."
5,10,1,"At that time the LORD said unto me,"
5,10,2,""
5,10,3,"And I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand."
5,10,4,"And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me."
5,10,5,"And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the LORD commanded me."
5,10,6,"And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth Benejaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead."
5,10,7,"From there they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of rivers of waters."
5,10,8,"At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day."
5,10,9,"Therefore Levi has no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD your God promised him."
5,10,10,"And I stayed in the mount, the same as the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy you."
5,10,11,"And the LORD said unto me,"
5,10,12,"And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,"
5,10,13,"To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good?"
5,10,14,"Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD'S your God, the earth also, with all that is in it."
5,10,15,"Only the LORD had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their descendants after them, even you above all people, as it is this day."
5,10,16,"Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked."
5,10,17,"For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, mighty, and awesome, who regards not persons, nor takes reward:"
5,10,18,"He executes justice for the fatherless and widow, and loves the stranger, in giving him food and clothing."
5,10,19,"Love you therefore the stranger: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt."
5,10,20,"You shall fear the LORD your God; him shall you serve, and to him shall you cleave, and swear by his name."
5,10,21,"He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen."
5,10,22,"Your fathers went down into Egypt with three score and ten persons; and now the LORD your God has made you as the stars of heaven for multitude."
5,11,1,"Therefore you shall love the LORD your God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, always."
5,11,2,"And know you this day: for I speak not with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his outstretched arm,"
5,11,3,"And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;"
5,11,4,"And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD has destroyed them unto this day;"
5,11,5,"And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until you came into this place;"
5,11,6,"And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:"
5,11,7,"But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did."
5,11,8,"Therefore shall you keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, wherever you go to possess it;"
5,11,9,"And that you may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD swore unto your fathers to give unto them and to their descendants, a land that flows with milk and honey."
5,11,10,"For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from where you came out, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs:"
5,11,11,"But the land, where you go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water from the rain of heaven:"
5,11,12,"A land which the LORD your God cares for: the eyes of the LORD your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year."
5,11,13,"And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,"
5,11,14,"That I will give you the rain of your land in its due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, and your wine, and your oil."
5,11,15,"And I will send grass in your fields for your cattle, that you may eat and be full."
5,11,16,"Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;"
5,11,17,"And then the LORD'S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest you perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gives you."
5,11,18,"Therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes."
5,11,19,"And you shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up."
5,11,20,"And you shall write them upon the door posts of your house, and upon your gates:"
5,11,21,"That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth."
5,11,22,"For if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;"
5,11,23,"Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall possess nations greater and mightier than yourselves."
5,11,24,"Every place on which the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the western sea shall your territory be."
5,11,25,"There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon, as he has said unto you."
5,11,26,"Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;"
5,11,27,"A blessing, if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:"
5,11,28,"And a curse, if you will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which you have not known."
5,11,29,"And it shall come to pass, when the LORD your God has brought you in unto the land where you go to possess it, that you shall put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal."
5,11,30,"Are they not on the other side of Jordan, by the way where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites, who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?"
5,11,31,"For you shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God gives you, and you shall possess it, and dwell therein."
5,11,32,"And you shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day."
5,12,1,"These are the statutes and judgments, which you shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of your fathers gives you to possess, all the days that you live upon the earth."
5,12,2,"You shall utterly destroy all the places, in which the nations which you shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:"
5,12,3,"And you shall overthrow their altars, and break their stone idols, and burn their idol poles with fire; and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place."
5,12,4,"You shall not do so unto the LORD your God."
5,12,5,"But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his dwelling place shall you seek, and there you shall come:"
5,12,6,"And there you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vowed offerings, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:"
5,12,7,"And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand unto, you and your households, in which the LORD your God has blessed you."
5,12,8,"You shall not do according to all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes."
5,12,9,"For you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God gives you."
5,12,10,"But when you go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, and when he gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety;"
5,12,11,"Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; there shall you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice offerings which you vow unto the LORD:"
5,12,12,"And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he has no part nor inheritance with you."
5,12,13,"Take heed to yourself that you offer not your burnt offerings in every place that you see:"
5,12,14,"But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you."
5,12,15,"Nevertheless you may kill and eat flesh in all your gates, whatsoever your soul desires, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart."
5,12,16,"Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it upon the earth as water."
5,12,17,"You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstlings of your herds or of your flock, nor any of your offerings which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, or heave offering of your hand:"
5,12,18,"But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put your hands unto."
5,12,19,"Take heed to yourself that you forsake not the Levite as long as you live upon the earth."
5,12,20,"When the LORD your God shall enlarge your border, as he has promised you, and you shall say, I will eat flesh, because your soul longs to eat flesh; you may eat flesh, whatsoever your soul desires."
5,12,21,"If the place which the LORD your God has chosen to put his name there is too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you, and you shall eat in your gates whatsoever your soul desires."
5,12,22,"Even as the gazelle and the hart is eaten, so you shall eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike."
5,12,23,"Only be sure that you eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and you may not eat the life with the flesh."
5,12,24,"You shall not eat it; you shall pour it upon the earth as water."
5,12,25,"You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do that which is right in the sight of the LORD."
5,12,26,"Only your holy things which you have, and your vowed offerings, you shall take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose."
5,12,27,"And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD your God: and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD your God, and you shall eat the flesh."
5,12,28,"Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God."
5,12,29,"When the LORD your God shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go to possess them, and you displace them, and dwell in their land;"
5,12,30,"Take heed to yourself that you are not snared by following them, after they are destroyed from before you; and that you inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise."
5,12,31,"You shall not do so unto the LORD your God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hates, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burned in the fire to their gods."
5,12,32,"Whatsoever thing I command you, observe to do it: you shall not add thereto, nor take away from it."
5,13,1,"If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,"
5,13,2,"And the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke unto you, and he says, Let us go after other gods, which you have not known, and let us serve them;"
5,13,3,"You shall not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God is testing you, to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul."
5,13,4,"You shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and you shall serve him, and cleave unto him."
5,13,5,"And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he has spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust you out of the way which the LORD your God commanded you to walk in. So shall you put the evil away from the midst of you."
5,13,6,"If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, who is as your own soul, entices you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;"
5,13,7,"Namely, of the gods of the people who are round about you, near unto you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;"
5,13,8,"You shall not yield unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal him:"
5,13,9,"But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people."
5,13,10,"And you shall stone him with stones, that he die; because he has sought to thrust you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage."
5,13,11,"And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you."
5,13,12,"If you shall hear in one of your cities, which the LORD your God has given you to dwell there, anyone saying,"
5,13,13,"Certain men, worthless fellows, are gone out from among you, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known;"
5,13,14,"Then shall you inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;"
5,13,15,"You shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is in it, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword."
5,13,16,"And you shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst of its street, and shall burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof, unto the LORD your God: and it shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again."
5,13,17,"And there shall cleave none of the accursed thing to your hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show you mercy, and have compassion upon you, and multiply you, as he has sworn unto your fathers;"
5,13,18,"When you shall hearken to the voice of the LORD your God, to keep all his commandments which I command you this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD your God."
5,14,1,"You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any bald place on your foreheads for the dead."
5,14,2,"For you are a holy people unto the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth."
5,14,3,"You shall not eat any abominable thing."
5,14,4,"These are the animals which you shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,"
5,14,5,"The hare, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the ibex, and the antelope, and the mountain sheep."
5,14,6,"And every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof split in two, and chews the cud, among the animals, that you shall eat."
5,14,7,"Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that have cloven hooves; as the camel, and the hare, and the rock badger: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you."
5,14,8,"And the swine, because it divides the hoof, yet chews not the cud, it is unclean unto you: you shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass."
5,14,9,"These you shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall you eat:"
5,14,10,"And whatsoever has not fins and scales you may not eat; it is unclean unto you."
5,14,11,"Of all clean birds you shall eat."
5,14,12,"But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, and the vulture, and the osprey,"
5,14,13,"And the buzzard, and the falcon, and the kite after their kinds,"
5,14,14,"And every raven after its kind,"
5,14,15,"And the ostrich, and the nighthawk, and the sea gull, and the hawk after their kinds,"
5,14,16,"The little owl, and the great owl, and the water hen,"
5,14,17,"And the pelican, and the carrion vulture, and the cormorant,"
5,14,18,"And the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat."
5,14,19,"And every winged insect is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten."
5,14,20,"But of all clean fowls you may eat."
5,14,21,"You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you shall give it unto the stranger that is in your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it unto a foreigner: for you are a holy people unto the LORD your God. you shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk."
5,14,22,"You shall truly tithe all the increase of your seed, that the field brings forth year by year."
5,14,23,"And you shall eat before the LORD your God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks; that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always."
5,14,24,"And if the way is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it; or if the place is too far from you, which the LORD your God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD your God has blessed you:"
5,14,25,"Then shall you turn it into money, and bind up the money in your hand, and shall go unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose:"
5,14,26,"And you shall bestow that money for whatsoever your soul desires, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever your soul desires: and you shall eat there before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice, you, and your household,"
5,14,27,"And the Levite that is within your gates; you shall not forsake him; for he has no part nor inheritance with you."
5,14,28,"At the end of three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:"
5,14,29,"And the Levite, (because he has no part nor inheritance with you,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do."
5,15,1,"At the end of every seven years you shall make a release."
5,15,2,"And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lends anything unto his neighbor shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD'S release."
5,15,3,"Of a foreigner you may exact it again: but that which you lend to your brother your hand shall release;"
5,15,4,"Except when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless you in the land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it:"
5,15,5,"Only if you carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD your God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command you this day."
5,15,6,"For the LORD your God blesses you, as he promised you: and you shall lend unto many nations, but you shall not borrow; and you shall reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over you."
5,15,7,"If there be among you a poor man of one of your brethren within any of your gates in your land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother:"
5,15,8,"But you shall open your hand wide unto him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he lacks."
5,15,9,"Beware that there be not a thought in your wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing; and he cries unto the LORD against you, and it be sin in you."
5,15,10,"You shall surely give to him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give unto him: because for this thing the LORD your God shall bless you in all your works, and in all that you put your hand unto."
5,15,11,"For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command you, saying, you shall open your hand wide unto your brother, to your poor, and to your needy, in your land."
5,15,12,"And if your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto you, and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you."
5,15,13,"And when you send him out free from you, you shall not let him go away empty:"
5,15,14,"You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress: of that with which the LORD your God has blessed you you shall give unto him."
5,15,15,"And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you: therefore I command you this thing today."
5,15,16,"And it shall be, if he say unto you, I will not go away from you; because he loves you and your house, because he fares well with you;"
5,15,17,"Then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be your servant forever. And also unto your maidservant you shall do likewise."
5,15,18,"It shall not seem hard unto you, when you send him away free from you; for he has been worth a double hired servant to you, in serving you six years: and the LORD your God shall bless you in all that you do."
5,15,19,"All the firstborn males that come of your herd and of your flock you shall sanctify unto the LORD your God: you shall do no work with the firstborn of your bullock, nor shear the firstborn of your sheep."
5,15,20,"You shall eat it before the LORD your God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, you and your household."
5,15,21,"And if there be any blemish in it, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, you shall not sacrifice it unto the LORD your God."
5,15,22,"You shall eat it within your gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart."
5,15,23,"Only you shall not eat the blood thereof; you shall pour it upon the ground as water."
5,16,1,"Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD your God: for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night."
5,16,2,"You shall therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there."
5,16,3,"You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you eat unleavened bread with it, even the bread of affliction: for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life."
5,16,4,"And there shall be no leavened bread seen with you in all your territory seven days; neither shall there any part of the flesh, which you sacrificed the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning."
5,16,5,"You may not sacrifice the passover within any of your gates, which the LORD your God gives you:"
5,16,6,"But at the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place his name in, there you shall sacrifice the passover at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the time that you came forth out of Egypt."
5,16,7,"And you shall roast and eat it in the place which the LORD your God shall choose: and you shall turn in the morning, and go unto your tents."
5,16,8,"Six days you shall eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD your God: you shall do no work therein."
5,16,9,"Seven weeks shall you number unto you: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as you begin to put the sickle to the grain."
5,16,10,"And you shall keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give unto the LORD your God, according as the LORD your God has blessed you:"
5,16,11,"And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD your God has chosen to place his name there."
5,16,12,"And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt: and you shall observe and do these statutes."
5,16,13,"You shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that you have gathered in your grain and your wine:"
5,16,14,"And you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within your gates."
5,16,15,"Seven days shall you keep a solemn feast unto the LORD your God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD your God shall bless you in all your increase, and in all the works of your hands, therefore you shall surely rejoice."
5,16,16,"Three times in a year shall all your males appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:"
5,16,17,"Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you."
5,16,18,"Judges and officers shall you make in all your gates, which the LORD your God gives you, throughout your tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment."
5,16,19,"You shall not pervert judgment; you shall not show partiality, neither take a bribe: for a bribe does blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous."
5,16,20,"That which is altogether just shall you follow, that you may live, and inherit the land which the LORD your God gives you."
5,16,21,"You shall not make a post idol of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make you."
5,16,22,"Neither shall you set up any image; which the LORD your God hates."
5,17,1,"You shall not sacrifice unto the LORD your God any bullock, or sheep, in which is a blemish, or any defect: for that is an abomination unto the LORD your God."
5,17,2,"If there be found among you, within any of your gates which the LORD your God gives you, man or woman, that has done wickedness in the sight of the LORD your God, in transgressing his covenant,"
5,17,3,"And has gone and served other gods, and worshiped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;"
5,17,4,"And it be told you, and you have heard of it, and inquired diligently, and, behold, it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination has been done in Israel:"
5,17,5,"Then shall you bring forth that man or that woman, who has committed that wicked thing, unto your gates, even that man or that woman, and shall stone them with stones, till they die."
5,17,6,"At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death."
5,17,7,"The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall put the evil away from among you."
5,17,8,"If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between bloodsheds, between legal rights, and between assaults, being matters of controversy within your gates: then shall you arise, and get you up into the place which the LORD your God shall choose;"
5,17,9,"And you shall come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment:"
5,17,10,"And you shall do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall show you; and you shall observe to do according to all that they inform you:"
5,17,11,"According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do: you shall not decline from the sentence which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left."
5,17,12,"And the man that will act presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that stands to minister there before the LORD your God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and you shall put away the evil from Israel."
5,17,13,"And all the people shall hear, and fear, and act no more presumptuously."
5,17,14,"When you are come unto the land which the LORD your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are about me;"
5,17,15,"You shall surely set him king over you, whom the LORD your God shall choose: one from among your brethren shall you set king over you: you may not set a stranger over you, who is not your brother."
5,17,16,"But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: since as the LORD has said unto you, you shall return no more that way again."
5,17,17,"Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold."
5,17,18,"And it shall be, when he sits upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write himself a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:"
5,17,19,"And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:"
5,17,20,"That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel."
5,18,1,"The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, as his inheritance."
5,18,2,"Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he has said unto them."
5,18,3,"And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two jowls, and the stomach."
5,18,4,"The firstfruit also of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, shall you give him."
5,18,5,"For the LORD your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons forever."
5,18,6,"And if a Levite come from any of your gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose;"
5,18,7,"Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, who stand there before the LORD."
5,18,8,"They shall have equal portions to eat, besides that which comes of the sale of his family possessions."
5,18,9,"When you are come into the land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations."
5,18,10,"There shall not be found among you any one that makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that uses divination, or sorcery, or interprets omens, or is a witch,"
5,18,11,"Or casts spells, or is a medium, or a wizard, or consults the dead."
5,18,12,"For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD your God does drive them out from before you."
5,18,13,"You shall be perfect with the LORD your God."
5,18,14,"For these nations, which you shall possess, hearkened unto sorcerers, and unto diviners: but as for you, the LORD your God has not allowed you so to do."
5,18,15,"The LORD your God will raise up unto you a Prophet from the midst of you, of your brethren, like unto me; unto him you shall hearken;"
5,18,16,"According to all that you desired of the LORD your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not."
5,18,17,"And the LORD said unto me,"
5,18,18,""
5,18,19,""
5,18,20,""
5,18,21,"And if you say in your heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD has not spoken?"
5,18,22,"When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD, if the thing follows not, nor comes to pass, that is, the thing which the LORD has not spoken, but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously: you shall not be afraid of him."
5,19,1,"When the LORD your God has cut off the nations, whose land the LORD your God gives you, and you dispossess them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;"
5,19,2,"You shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to possess it."
5,19,3,"You shall prepare you a way, and divide the territory of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee there."
5,19,4,"And this is the case of the manslayer, who shall flee there, that he may live: Whoever kills his neighbor unintentionally, whom he hated not in time past;"
5,19,5,"As when a man goes into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand swings a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle, and strikes his neighbor, that he dies; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:"
5,19,6,"Lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his anger is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated the victim not in time past."
5,19,7,"Therefore I command you, saying, you shall set apart three cities for you."
5,19,8,"And if the LORD your God enlarges your border, as he has sworn unto your fathers, and gives you all the land which he promised to give unto your fathers;"
5,19,9,"If you shall keep all these commandments to do them, which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to walk always in his ways; then shall you add three more cities for you, besides these three:"
5,19,10,"That innocent blood be not shed in your land, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance, and so blood be upon you."
5,19,11,"But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and wounds him mortally that he dies, and flees into one of these cities:"
5,19,12,"Then the elders of his city shall send and bring him from there, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die."
5,19,13,"Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you."
5,19,14,"You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which the men of old time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit in the land that the LORD your God gives you to possess it."
5,19,15,"One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established."
5,19,16,"If a false witness rises up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;"
5,19,17,"Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, who shall be in those days;"
5,19,18,"And the judges shall make diligent inquiry: and, behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother;"
5,19,19,"Then shall you do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shall you put the evil away from among you."
5,19,20,"And those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall hereafter commit no more any such evil among you."
5,19,21,"And your eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."
5,20,1,"When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, and chariots, and a people more than you, be not afraid of them: for the LORD your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."
5,20,2,"And it shall be, when you are come near unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,"
5,20,3,"And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, you approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be you terrified because of them;"
5,20,4,"For the LORD your God is he that goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you."
5,20,5,"And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it."
5,20,6,"And what man is he that has planted a vineyard, and has not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it."
5,20,7,"And what man is there that has betrothed a wife, and has not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her."
5,20,8,"And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart."
5,20,9,"And it shall be, when the officers have finished speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people."
5,20,10,"When you come near unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it."
5,20,11,"And it shall be, if it makes to you an answer of peace, and opens unto you, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein shall be subject unto you, and they shall serve you."
5,20,12,"And if it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it:"
5,20,13,"And when the LORD your God has delivered it into your hands, you shall strike every male in it with the edge of the sword:"
5,20,14,"But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shall you take unto yourself; and you shall eat the spoil of your enemies, which the LORD your God has given you."
5,20,15,"Thus shall you do unto all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations."
5,20,16,"But of the cities of these people, which the LORD your God does give you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes:"
5,20,17,"But you shall utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD your God has commanded you:"
5,20,18,"That they teach you not to do according to all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so that you should sin against the LORD your God."
5,20,19,"When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy the trees thereof by wielding an ax against them: for you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:"
5,20,20,"Only the trees which you know will not be trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it is subdued."
5,21,1,"If one be found slain in the land which the LORD your God gives you to possess, lying in the field, and it is not known who has slain him:"
5,21,2,"Then your elders and your judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:"
5,21,3,"And it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer, which has never been worked, and which has not pulled in the yoke;"
5,21,4,"And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a valley with flowing water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley:"
5,21,5,"And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD your God has chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every assault be tried:"
5,21,6,"And all the elders of that city, that are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley:"
5,21,7,"And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it."
5,21,8,"Be merciful, O LORD, unto your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto the charge of your people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them."
5,21,9,"So shall you put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when you shall do that which is right in the sight of the LORD."
5,21,10,"When you go forth to war against your enemies, and the LORD your God has delivered them into your hands, and you have taken them captive,"
5,21,11,"And see among the captives a beautiful woman, and have a desire unto her, that you would have her to be your wife;"
5,21,12,"Then you shall bring her home to your house; and she shall shave her head, and trim her nails;"
5,21,13,"And she shall put the clothing of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in your house, and mourn her father and her mother a full month: and after that you shall go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be your wife."
5,21,14,"And it shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she will; but you shall not sell her at all for money, you shall not make merchandise of her, because you have humiliated her."
5,21,15,"If a man has two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:"
5,21,16,"Then it shall be, when he makes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, who is indeed the firstborn:"
5,21,17,"But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated as the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he has: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his."
5,21,18,"If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:"
5,21,19,"Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;"
5,21,20,"And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard."
5,21,21,"And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, so that he dies: so shall you put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear."
5,21,22,"And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is to be put to death, and you hang him on a tree:"
5,21,23,"His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but you shall surely bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that your land be not defiled, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance."
5,22,1,"You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and withhold your help from them: you shall certainly bring them again unto your brother."
5,22,2,"And if your brother is not near unto you, or if you know him not, then you shall bring it unto your own house, and it shall be with you until your brother seeks after it, and you shall restore it to him again."
5,22,3,"In like manner shall you do with his donkey; and so shall you do with his clothing; and with any lost thing of your brother's, which he has lost, and you have found, shall you do likewise: you may not withhold your help."
5,22,4,"You shall not see your brother's donkey or his ox fall down by the way, and withhold your help from them: you shall surely help him to lift them up again."
5,22,5,"The woman shall not wear that which pertains unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are an abomination unto the LORD your God."
5,22,6,"If a bird's nest happens to be before you in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they are young ones, or eggs, and the mother sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young:"
5,22,7,"But you shall surely let the mother go, and take the young for yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days."
5,22,8,"When you build a new house, then you shall make a parapet for your roof, that you bring not the guilt of blood upon your house, if any man fall from there."
5,22,9,"You shall not sow your vineyard with different seeds: lest the fruit of your seed which you have sown, and the fruit of your vineyard, be defiled."
5,22,10,"You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together."
5,22,11,"You shall not wear a garment of different sorts, as of woolen and linen together."
5,22,12,"You shall make tassels upon the four corners of your cloak, with which you cover yourself."
5,22,13,"If any man takes a wife, and goes in unto her, and hates her,"
5,22,14,"And charges her with shameful conduct, and brings an evil name upon her, and says, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a virgin:"
5,22,15,"Then shall the father of the young woman, and her mother, take and bring forth the evidence of the young womanâ€™s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate:"
5,22,16,"And the young womanâ€™s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man as a wife, and he hates her;"
5,22,17,"And, lo, he has charged her with shameful conduct, saying, I found not your daughter a virgin; and yet these are the evidence of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city."
5,22,18,"And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;"
5,22,19,"And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the young woman, because he has brought an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days."
5,22,20,"But if this thing is true, and the evidence of virginity is not found for the young woman:"
5,22,21,"Then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones so that she dies: because she has wrought folly in Israel, to play the harlot in her father's house: so shall you put evil away from among you."
5,22,22,"If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shall you put away evil from Israel."
5,22,23,"If a young woman that is a virgin be betrothed unto a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;"
5,22,24,"Then you shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and you shall stone them with stones so that they die; the young woman, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he has violated his neighbor's wife: so you shall put away evil from among you."
5,22,25,"But if a man find a betrothed young woman in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die:"
5,22,26,"But unto the young woman you shall do nothing; there is in the young woman no sin worthy of death: for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and slays him, even so is this matter:"
5,22,27,"For he found her in the field, and the betrothed young woman cried, and there was none to save her."
5,22,28,"If a man find a young woman that is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;"
5,22,29,"Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the young woman's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he has violated her, he may not put her away all his days."
5,22,30,"A man shall not take his father's wife, nor uncover his father's bed."
5,23,1,"He that is a eunuch by crushing or mutilation shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD."
5,23,2,"A man of illegitimate birth shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD."
5,23,3,"An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD forever:"
5,23,4,"Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you."
5,23,5,"Nevertheless the LORD your God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing unto you, because the LORD your God loved you."
5,23,6,"You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever."
5,23,7,"You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother: you shall not abhor an Egyptian; because you were a stranger in his land."
5,23,8,"The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation."
5,23,9,"When the army goes forth against your enemies, then keep yourself from every wicked thing."
5,23,10,"If there be among you any man, that is unclean by reason of some occurrence in the night, then shall he go outside the camp, he shall not come inside the camp:"
5,23,11,"But it shall be, when evening comes on, he shall wash himself with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again."
5,23,12,"You shall have a place also outside the camp, where you shall go out:"
5,23,13,"And you shall have a stick with your weapons; and it shall be, when you will relieve yourself outside, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover your refuse:"
5,23,14,"For the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you; therefore shall your camp be holy: that he sees no unclean thing in you, and turns away from you."
5,23,15,"You shall not deliver unto his master the servant who has escaped from his master unto you:"
5,23,16,"He may dwell with you, even among you, in that place which he shall choose within one of your gates, where it seems best to him: you shall not oppress him."
5,23,17,"There shall be no harlot of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel."
5,23,18,"You shall not bring the wages of a harlot, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD your God for any vow: for even both of these are an abomination unto the LORD your God."
5,23,19,"You shall not charge interest to your brother; interest on money, interest on food, interest on anything that is lent for interest:"
5,23,20,"Unto a stranger you may lend for interest; but unto your brother you shall not lend for interest: that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you set your hand to in the land where you go to possess it."
5,23,21,"When you shall vow a vow unto the LORD your God, you shall not delay to pay it: for the LORD your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin to you."
5,23,22,"But if you shall abstain to vow, it shall be no sin to you."
5,23,23,"That which is gone out from your lips you shall keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as you have vowed unto the LORD your God, which you have promised with your mouth."
5,23,24,"When you come into your neighbor's vineyard, then you may eat your fill of grapes at your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your vessel."
5,23,25,"When you come into the standing grain of your neighbor, then you may pluck the heads with your hand; but you shall not move a sickle unto your neighbor's standing grain."
5,24,1,"When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it comes to pass that she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and put it in her hand, and send her out of his house."
5,24,2,"And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife."
5,24,3,"And if the latter husband hates her, and writes her a bill of divorcement, and puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the latter husband dies, who took her to be his wife;"
5,24,4,"Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and you shall not cause the land to sin, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance."
5,24,5,"When a man has taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall bring happiness to his wife whom he has taken."
5,24,6,"No man shall take the lower or the upper millstone in pledge: for he takes a man's living in pledge."
5,24,7,"If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and makes merchandise of him, or sells him; then that thief shall die; and you shall put evil away from among you."
5,24,8,"Take heed in a plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so you shall observe to do."
5,24,9,"Remember what the LORD your God did unto Miriam by the way, after you were come forth out of Egypt."
5,24,10,"When you do lend your brother anything, you shall not go into his house to get his pledge."
5,24,11,"You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you do lend shall bring out the pledge unto you."
5,24,12,"And if the man be poor, you shall not sleep with his pledge:"
5,24,13,"In any case you shall deliver him the pledge again when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his own clothing, and bless you: and it shall be righteousness unto you before the LORD your God."
5,24,14,"You shall not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of your brethren, or of your strangers that are in your land within your gates:"
5,24,15,"Each day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and sets his heart upon it: lest he cry against you unto the LORD, and it be sin unto you."
5,24,16,"The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin."
5,24,17,"You shall not pervert the justice due the stranger, nor the fatherless; nor take a widow's clothing as pledge:"
5,24,18,"But you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you from there: therefore I command you to do this thing."
5,24,19,"When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands."
5,24,20,"When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow."
5,24,21,"When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow."
5,24,22,"And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt: therefore I command you to do this thing."
5,25,1,"If there is a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked."
5,25,2,"And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number."
5,25,3,"Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him more than these with many stripes, then your brother should seem degraded unto you."
5,25,4,"You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain."
5,25,5,"If brethren dwell together, and one of them dies, and has no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry outside unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him as wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her."
5,25,6,"And it shall be, that the firstborn that she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel."
5,25,7,"And if the man desires not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuses to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother."
5,25,8,"Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stands to it, and says, I desire not to take her;"
5,25,9,"Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house."
5,25,10,"And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that has his shoe loosed."
5,25,11,"When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draws near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smites him, and puts forth her hand, and takes him by his private parts:"
5,25,12,"Then you shall cut off her hand, your eye shall not pity her."
5,25,13,"You shall not have in your bag differing weights, a great and a small."
5,25,14,"You shall not have in your house differing measures, a great and a small."
5,25,15,"But you shall have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shall you have: that your days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD your God gives you."
5,25,16,"For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD your God."
5,25,17,"Remember what Amalek did unto you by the way, when you came forth out of Egypt;"
5,25,18,"How he met you by the way, and attacked those behind you, even all that were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary; and he feared not God."
5,25,19,"Therefore it shall be, when the LORD your God has given you rest from all your enemies round about, in the land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it, that you shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; you shall not forget it."
5,26,1,"And it shall be, when you are come in unto the land which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance, and possess it, and dwell therein;"
5,26,2,"That you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which you shall bring of your land that the LORD your God gives you, and shall put it in a basket, and shall go unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place his name there."
5,26,3,"And you shall go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD your God, that I am come unto the country which the LORD swore unto our fathers to give us."
5,26,4,"And the priest shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD your God."
5,26,5,"And you shall speak and say before the LORD your God, An Aramean ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:"
5,26,6,"And the Egyptians mistreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:"
5,26,7,"And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labor, and our oppression:"
5,26,8,"And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror, and with signs, and with wonders:"
5,26,9,"And he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, even a land that flows with milk and honey."
5,26,10,"And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which you, O LORD, have given me. And you shall set it before the LORD your God, and worship before the LORD your God:"
5,26,11,"And you shall rejoice in every good thing which the LORD your God has given unto you, and unto your house, you, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you."
5,26,12,"When you have finished tithing all the tithes of your increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and have given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within your gates, and be filled;"
5,26,13,"Then you shall say before the LORD your God, I have removed the sacred portion out of my house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your commandments which you have commanded me: I have not transgressed your commandments, neither have I forgotten them:"
5,26,14,"I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I taken away any of it for any unclean use, nor given any of it for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that you have commanded me."
5,26,15,"Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the land which you have given us, as you swore unto our fathers, a land that flows with milk and honey."
5,26,16,"This day the LORD your God has commanded you to do these statutes and judgments: you shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart, and with all your soul."
5,26,17,"You have declared the LORD this day to be your God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:"
5,26,18,"And the LORD has declared you this day to be his peculiar people, as he has promised you, and that you should keep all his commandments;"
5,26,19,"And to make you high above all nations which he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be a holy people unto the LORD your God, as he has spoken."
5,27,1,"And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day."
5,27,2,"And it shall be on the day when you shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD your God gives you, that you shall set yourselves up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:"
5,27,3,"And you shall write upon them all the words of this law, when you are passed over, that you may go in unto the land which the LORD your God gives you, a land that flows with milk and honey; as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you."
5,27,4,"Therefore it shall be when you are gone over Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster."
5,27,5,"And there shall you build an altar unto the LORD your God, an altar of stones: you shall not lift up any iron tool upon them."
5,27,6,"You shall build the altar of the LORD your God of whole stones: and you shall offer burnt offerings on it unto the LORD your God:"
5,27,7,"And you shall offer peace offerings, and shall eat there, and rejoice before the LORD your God."
5,27,8,"And you shall write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly."
5,27,9,"And Moses and the priests, the Levites, spoke unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day you are become the people of the LORD your God."
5,27,10,"You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command you this day."
5,27,11,"And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,"
5,27,12,"These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:"
5,27,13,"And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali."
5,27,14,"And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,"
5,27,15,"Cursed be the man that makes any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen."
5,27,16,"Cursed be he that dishonors his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,17,"Cursed be he that removes his neighborâ€™s landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,18,"Cursed be he that makes the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,19,"Cursed be he that perverts the justice due the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,20,"Cursed be he that lies with his fatherâ€™s wife; because he uncovers his fatherâ€™s bed. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,21,"Cursed be he that lies with any kind of animal. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,22,"Cursed be he that lies with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,23,"Cursed be he that lies with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,24,"Cursed be he that attacks his neighbor secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,25,"Cursed be he that takes a bribe to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,27,26,"Cursed be he that confirms not all the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen."
5,28,1,"And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD your God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command you this day, that the LORD your God will set you on high above all nations of the earth:"
5,28,2,"And all these blessings shall come on you, and overtake you, if you shall hearken unto the voice of the LORD your God."
5,28,3,"Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field."
5,28,4,"Blessed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground, and the fruit of your herds, the increase of your cattle, and the flocks of your sheep."
5,28,5,"Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading-trough."
5,28,6,"Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out."
5,28,7,"The LORD shall cause your enemies that rise up against you to be defeated before your face: they shall come out against you one way, and flee before you seven ways."
5,28,8,"The LORD shall command the blessing upon you in your storehouses, and in all that you set your hand unto; and he shall bless you in the land which the LORD your God gives you."
5,28,9,"The LORD shall establish you a holy people unto himself, as he has sworn unto you, if you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in his ways."
5,28,10,"And all people of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of you."
5,28,11,"And the LORD shall make you bountiful in goods, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your cattle, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land which the LORD swore unto your fathers to give you."
5,28,12,"The LORD shall open unto you his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand: and you shall lend unto many nations, and you shall not borrow."
5,28,13,"And the LORD shall make you the head, and not the tail; and you shall be above only, and you shall not be beneath; if that you hearken unto the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day, to observe and to do them:"
5,28,14,"And you shall not go aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them."
5,28,15,"But it shall come to pass, if you will not hearken unto the voice of the LORD your God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day; that all these curses shall come upon you, and overtake you:"
5,28,16,"Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field."
5,28,17,"Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading-trough."
5,28,18,"Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your land, the increase of your cattle, and the offspring of your sheep."
5,28,19,"Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out."
5,28,20,"The LORD shall send upon you cursing, confusion, and rebuke, in all that you set your hand unto to do, until you are destroyed, and until you perish quickly; because of the wickedness of your doings, by which you have forsaken me."
5,28,21,"The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto you, until he has consumed you from off the land, which you go to possess."
5,28,22,"The LORD shall strike you with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with the sword, and with blight, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish."
5,28,23,"And your heaven that is over your head shall be bronze, and the earth that is under you shall be iron."
5,28,24,"The LORD shall make the rain of your land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon you, until you be destroyed."
5,28,25,"The LORD shall cause you to be defeated before your enemies: you shall go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shall be a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth."

5,28,27,"The LORD will strike you with the boils of Egypt, and with tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, of which you can not be healed."
5,28,28,"The LORD shall strike you with madness, and blindness, and confusion of mind:"
5,28,29,"And you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways: and you shall be only oppressed and plundered continually, and no man shall save you."
5,28,30,"You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: you shall build a house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not gather the grapes thereof."
5,28,31,"Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall not eat thereof: your donkey shall be violently taken away from before your face, and shall not be restored to you: your sheep shall be given unto your enemies, and you shall have none to rescue them."
5,28,32,"Your sons and your daughters shall be given unto another people, and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long: and there shall be no strength in your hand."
5,28,33,"The fruit of your land, and all your labors, shall a nation which you know not eat up; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed continually:"
5,28,34,"So that you shall be driven mad by the sight of your eyes which you shall see."
5,28,35,"The LORD shall strike you in the knees, and in the legs, with painful boils that cannot be healed, from the sole of your foot unto the top of your head."
5,28,36,"The LORD shall bring you, and your king which you shall set over you, unto a nation which neither you nor your fathers have known; and there shall you serve other gods, of wood and stone."
5,28,37,"And you shall become a horror, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations where the LORD shall lead you."
5,28,38,"You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it."
5,28,39,"You shall plant vineyards, and dress them, but shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them."
5,28,40,"You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives shall drop off."
5,28,41,"You shall beget sons and daughters, but you shall not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity."
5,28,42,"All your trees and fruit of your land shall the locust consume."
5,28,43,"The stranger that is among you shall rise up above you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower."
5,28,44,"He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him: he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail."
5,28,45,"Moreover all these curses shall come upon you, and shall pursue you, and overtake you, till you are destroyed; because you hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you:"
5,28,46,"And they shall be upon you for a sign and for a wonder, and upon your descendants forever."
5,28,47,"Because you served not the LORD your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;"
5,28,48,"Therefore shall you serve your enemies which the LORD shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon your neck, until he has destroyed you."
5,28,49,"The LORD shall bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies; a nation whose tongue you shall not understand;"
5,28,50,"A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young:"
5,28,51,"And he shall eat the fruit of your cattle, and the fruit of your land, until you are destroyed: who also shall not leave you either grain, wine, or oil, or the increase of your cattle, or offspring of your sheep, until he has destroyed you."
5,28,52,"And he shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted, throughout all your land: and he shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land, which the LORD your God has given you."
5,28,53,"And you shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, which the LORD your God has given you, in the siege, and in the distress, with which your enemies shall distress you:"
5,28,54,"So that the man that is gentle among you, and very refined, his eye shall show no compassion toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave behind:"
5,28,55,"So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he has nothing left him in the siege, and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you in all your gates."
5,28,56,"The gentle and refined woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot upon the ground because of her gentleness and refinement, her eye shall show no compassion toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,"
5,28,57,"And toward her afterbirth that comes out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for lack of all things secretly in the siege and distress, with which your enemy shall distress you in your gates."
5,28,58,"If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD YOUR GOD;"
5,28,59,"Then the LORD will make your plagues abundant, and the plagues of your descendants, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and severe sicknesses, of long continuance."
5,28,60,"Moreover he will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave unto you."
5,28,61,"Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon you, until you are destroyed."
5,28,62,"And you shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God."
5,28,63,"And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nothing; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go to possess it."
5,28,64,"And the LORD shall scatter you among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known, even wood and stone."
5,28,65,"And among these nations shall you find no ease, neither shall the sole of your foot have rest: but the LORD shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:"
5,28,66,"And your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear day and night, and shall have no assurance of your life:"
5,28,67,"In the morning you shall say, Would God it were evening! and at evening you shall say, Would God it were morning! because of the fear of your heart by which you shall fear, and because of the sight of your eyes which you shall see."
5,28,68,"And the LORD shall bring you into Egypt again in ships, by the way of which I spoke unto you, You shall see it no more again: and there you shall be sold unto your enemies as male and female slaves, and no man shall buy you."
5,29,1,"These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb."
5,29,2,"And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, You have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;"
5,29,3,"The great trials which your eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:"
5,29,4,"Yet the LORD has not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day."
5,29,5,"And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes have not worn out upon you, and your shoes have not worn out upon your foot."
5,29,6,"You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink: that you might know that I am the LORD your God."
5,29,7,"And when you came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle, and we defeated them:"
5,29,8,"And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh."
5,29,9,"Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do."
5,29,10,"You stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your heads of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,"
5,29,11,"Your little ones, your wives, and your stranger that is in your camp, from the hewer of your wood unto the drawer of your water:"
5,29,12,"That you should enter into covenant with the LORD your God, and into his oath, which the LORD your God makes with you this day:"
5,29,13,"That he may establish you today for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto you a God, as he has said unto you, and as he has sworn unto your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
5,29,14,"Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;"
5,29,15,"But with him that stands here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:"
5,29,16,"(For you know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which you passed by;"
5,29,17,"And you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)"
5,29,18,"Lest there should be among you a man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears bitterness or wormwood;"
5,29,19,"And it comes to pass, when he hears the words of this curse, that he blesses himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:"
5,29,20,"The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven."
5,29,21,"And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:"
5,29,22,"So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD has laid upon it;"
5,29,23,"And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor does it bear, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:"
5,29,24,"Even all nations shall say, Why has the LORD done thus unto this land? what does the heat of this great anger mean?"
5,29,25,"Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:"
5,29,26,"For they went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:"
5,29,27,"And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:"
5,29,28,"And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day."
5,29,29,"The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law."
5,30,1,"And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations, where the LORD your God has driven you,"
5,30,2,"And shall return unto the LORD your God, and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul;"

6,4,13,"About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho."
6,4,14,"On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life."
6,4,15,"And the LORD spoke unto Joshua, saying,"
6,4,16,""
6,4,17,"Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come you up out of Jordan."
6,4,18,"And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all its banks, as they did before."
6,4,19,"And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho."
6,4,20,"And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal."
6,4,21,"And he spoke unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?"
6,4,22,"Then you shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land."
6,4,23,"For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until you were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:"
6,4,24,"That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that you might fear the LORD your God forever."
6,5,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel."
6,5,2,"At that time the LORD said unto Joshua,"
6,5,3,"And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins."
6,5,4,"And this is the reason why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt."
6,5,5,"Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised."
6,5,6,"For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land, which the LORD swore unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that flows with milk and honey."
6,5,7,"And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way."
6,5,8,"And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were healed."
6,5,9,"And the LORD said unto Joshua,"
6,5,10,"And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho."
6,5,11,"And they did eat of the old grain of the land the next day after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched grain on the very same day."
6,5,12,"And the manna ceased the next day after they had eaten of the old grain of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year."
6,5,13,"And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, are you for us, or for our adversaries?"
6,5,14,"And he said,"
6,5,15,"And the captain of the LORD'S army said unto Joshua,"
6,6,1,"Now Jericho was securely shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in."
6,6,2,"And the LORD said unto Joshua,"
6,6,3,""
6,6,4,""
6,6,5,""
6,6,6,"And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD."
6,6,7,"And he said unto the people, Pass on, and march around the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD."
6,6,8,"And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them."
6,6,9,"And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets."
6,6,10,"And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, you shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall you shout."
6,6,11,"So the ark of the LORD circled the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp."
6,6,12,"And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD."
6,6,13,"And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets."
6,6,14,"And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days."
6,6,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and marched around the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they marched around the city seven times."
6,6,16,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD has given you the city."
6,6,17,"And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent."
6,6,18,"And you, by all means keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest you make yourselves accursed, when you take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it."
6,6,19,"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD."
6,6,20,"So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city."
6,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword."
6,6,22,"But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out there the woman, and all that she has, as you swore unto her."
6,6,23,"And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them outside the camp of Israel."
6,6,24,"And they burned the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD."
6,6,25,"And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwells in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho."
6,6,26,"And Joshua charged them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that rises up and builds this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof with his firstborn, and with his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it."
6,6,27,"So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was spread throughout all the country."
6,7,1,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel."
6,7,2,"And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai."
6,7,3,"And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai; and make not all the people to toil up there; for they are but few."
6,7,4,"So there went up there of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai."
6,7,5,"And the men of Ai struck of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and struck them on the descent: therefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water."
6,7,6,"And Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads."
6,7,7,"And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, why have you at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelled on the other side of Jordan!"
6,7,8,"O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turns their backs before their enemies!"
6,7,9,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall surround us, and cut off our name from the earth: and what will you do for your great name?"
6,7,10,"And the LORD said unto Joshua,"
6,7,11,""
6,7,12,""
6,7,13,""
6,7,14,""
6,7,15,""
6,7,16,"So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:"
6,7,17,"And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zerahites: and he brought the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:"
6,7,18,"And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken."
6,7,19,"And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me."
6,7,20,"And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I have done:"
6,7,21,"When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it."
6,7,22,"So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it."
6,7,23,"And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD."
6,7,24,"And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor."
6,7,25,"And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? the LORD shall trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones."
6,7,26,"And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day."
6,8,1,"And the LORD said unto Joshua,"
6,8,2,""
6,8,3,"So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night."
6,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, you shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be you all ready:"
6,8,5,"And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,"
6,8,6,"(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them."
6,8,7,"Then you shall rise up from the ambush, and seize the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand."
6,8,8,"And it shall be, when you have taken the city, that you shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall you do. See, I have commanded you."
6,8,9,"Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people."
6,8,10,"And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai."
6,8,11,"And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and camped on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai."
6,8,12,"And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city."
6,8,13,"And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and those lying in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley."
6,8,14,"And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city."
6,8,15,"And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness."
6,8,16,"And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city."
6,8,17,"And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel."
6,8,18,"And the LORD said unto Joshua,"
6,8,19,"And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hurried to set the city on fire."
6,8,20,"And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers."
6,8,21,"And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai."
6,8,22,"And the others came out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they struck them, so that they let none of them remain or escape."
6,8,23,"And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua."
6,8,24,"And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they had chased them, and when they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword."
6,8,25,"And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai."
6,8,26,"For Joshua drew not his hand back, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai."
6,8,27,"Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua."
6,8,28,"And Joshua burned Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation unto this day."
6,8,29,"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise on it a great heap of stones, that remains unto this day."
6,8,30,"Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,"
6,8,31,"As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man has lifted up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings."
6,8,32,"And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel."
6,8,33,"And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel."
6,8,34,"And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law."
6,8,35,"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were living among them."
6,9,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings who were on this side of Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea toward Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard of it;"
6,9,2,"That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord."
6,9,3,"And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,"
6,9,4,"They did work craftily, and went and made as if they were ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their donkeys, and wine skins, old, and torn, and mended;"
6,9,5,"And old patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy."
6,9,6,"And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country: now therefore make you a covenant with us."
6,9,7,"And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Perhaps you dwell among us; and how shall we make a covenant with you?"
6,9,8,"And they said unto Joshua, We are your servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are you? and from where do you come?"
6,9,9,"And they said unto him, From a very far country your servants have come because of the name of the LORD your God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,"
6,9,10,"And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth."
6,9,11,"Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make you a covenant with us."
6,9,12,"This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is moldy:"
6,9,13,"And these skins of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they are torn: and these our garments and our shoes have become old by reason of the very long journey."
6,9,14,"And the men took of their provisions, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD."
6,9,15,"And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the leaders of the congregation swore to them."
6,9,16,"And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them."
6,9,17,"And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriathjearim."
6,9,18,"And the children of Israel struck them not, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the leaders."
6,9,19,"But all the leaders said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them."
6,9,20,"This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath come upon us, because of the oath which we swore to them."
6,9,21,"And the leaders said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the leaders had promised them."
6,9,22,"And Joshua called for them, and he spoke unto them, saying, Why have you deceived us, saying, We are very far from you; when you dwell among us?"
6,9,23,"Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being slaves, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God."
6,9,24,"And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told your servants, how that the LORD your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were very much afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing."
6,9,25,"And now, behold, we are in your hand: as it seems good and right unto you to do unto us, do."
6,9,26,"And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not."
6,9,27,"And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose."
6,10,1,"Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;"
6,10,2,"That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty."
6,10,3,"Therefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,"
6,10,4,"Come up unto me, and help me, that we may attack Gibeon: for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel."
6,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their armies, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it."
6,10,6,"And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Abandon not your hand from your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us."
6,10,7,"So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor."
6,10,8,"And the LORD said unto Joshua,"
6,10,9,"Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night."
6,10,10,"And the LORD brought panic upon them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goes up to Bethhoron, and struck them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah."
6,10,11,"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were on the decent to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword."
6,10,12,"Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand you still upon Gibeon; and you, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon."
6,10,13,"And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hastened not to go down about a whole day."
6,10,14,"And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel."
6,10,15,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal."
6,10,16,"But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah."
6,10,17,"And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah."
6,10,18,"And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them:"
6,10,19,"And stay you not there, but pursue after your enemies, and attack their rear guards; allow them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand."
6,10,20,"And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were finished, that the rest which remained of them entered into fortified cities."
6,10,21,"And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel."
6,10,22,"Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave."
6,10,23,"And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon."
6,10,24,"And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them."
6,10,25,"And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom you fight."
6,10,26,"And afterward Joshua struck them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening."
6,10,27,"And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day."
6,10,28,"And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king he utterly destroyed, the people, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho."
6,10,29,"Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:"
6,10,30,"And the LORD delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel; and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto its king as he did unto the king of Jericho."
6,10,31,"And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:"
6,10,32,"And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah."
6,10,33,"Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining."
6,10,34,"And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:"
6,10,35,"And they took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish."
6,10,36,"And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:"
6,10,37,"And they took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein."
6,10,38,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:"
6,10,39,"And he took it, and its king, and all its cities; and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king."
6,10,40,"So Joshua struck all the country of the hills, and of the South, and of the lowland, and of the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded."
6,10,41,"And Joshua struck them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon."
6,10,42,"And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel."
6,10,43,"And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal."
6,11,1,"And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,"
6,11,2,"And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland, and in the borders of Dor on the west,"
6,11,3,"And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah."
6,11,4,"And they went out, they and all their armies with them, many people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many."
6,11,5,"And when all these kings were met together, they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel."
6,11,6,"And the LORD said unto Joshua,"
6,11,7,"So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them."
6,11,8,"And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them, and chased them unto great Sidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpah eastward; and they struck them, until they left none remaining."
6,11,9,"And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burned their chariots with fire."
6,11,10,"And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and struck the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor formerly was the head of all those kingdoms."
6,11,11,"And they struck all the souls that were there with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left that breathed: and he burnt Hazor with fire."
6,11,12,"And all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, did Joshua take, and struck them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded."
6,11,13,"But as for the cities that still stood in their strength, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only; that did Joshua burn."
6,11,14,"And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed."
6,11,15,"As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses."
6,11,16,"So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the plain, and the mountains of Israel, its lowlands;"
6,11,17,"Even from the mount Halak, that rises up toward Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon below mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and struck them, and slew them."
6,11,18,"Joshua made war a long time with all those kings."
6,11,19,"There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all others they took in battle."
6,11,20,"For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses."
6,11,21,"And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakim from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities."
6,11,22,"There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, any remained."
6,11,23,"So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war."
6,12,1,"Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel struck, and possessed their land on the other side of Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:"
6,12,2,"Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelled in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the bank of the river Arnon, from the middle of the river, and from half of Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;"

6,17,3,"But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah."
6,17,4,"And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the leaders, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father."
6,17,5,"And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of Jordan;"
6,17,6,"Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead."
6,17,7,"And the territory of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, that lies east of Shechem; and the border went along on the south to the inhabitants of Entappuah."
6,17,8,"Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;"
6,17,9,"And the border descended to the brook Kanah, south of the brook: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the border of Manasseh also was on the north side of the brook, and the end of it was at the sea:"
6,17,10,"Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea was its border; and they joined together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east."
6,17,11,"And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and its villages, and Ibleam and its villages, and the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, and the inhabitants of Endor and its villages, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages, even three regions."
6,17,12,"Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would persist to dwell in that land."
6,17,13,"Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor; but did not utterly drive them out."
6,17,14,"And the children of Joseph spoke unto Joshua, saying, Why have you given us only one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing we are a great people, since the LORD has blessed us until now?"
6,17,15,"And Joshua answered them, If you are a great people, then get up to the forest country, and clear ground for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim is too narrow for you."
6,17,16,"But the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and its villages, and they who are in the valley of Jezreel."
6,17,17,"And Joshua spoke unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have great power: you shall not have one lot only:"
6,17,18,"But the mountain country shall be yours; for it is a forest, and you shall cut it down: and all the borders of it shall be yours: for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they are strong."
6,18,1,"And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of meeting there. And the land was subdued before them."
6,18,2,"And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance."
6,18,3,"And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long will you hesitate to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers has given you?"
6,18,4,"Pick out from among you three men from each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and survey it according to their inheritance; and they shall come again to me."
6,18,5,"And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall continue in their territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall continue in their territory on the north."
6,18,6,"You shall therefore survey the land into seven parts, and bring the description here to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God."
6,18,7,"But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and the half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them."
6,18,8,"And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to survey the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and survey it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh."
6,18,9,"And the men went and passed through the land, and surveyed it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh."
6,18,10,"And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions."
6,18,11,"And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the territory of their lot came out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph."
6,18,12,"And their border on the north side was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and it ended at the wilderness of Bethaven."
6,18,13,"And the border went over from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that lies on the south side of lower Bethhoron."
6,18,14,"And the border extended from there, and turned the corner at the sea southward, from the hill that lies before Bethhoron southward; and ended at Kiriathbaal, which is Kiriathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west side."
6,18,15,"And the south side was from the end of Kiriathjearim, and the border extended on the west, and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah:"
6,18,16,"And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusites on the south, and descended to Enrogel,"
6,18,17,"And it went around from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,"
6,18,18,"And passed along toward the north side of Arabah, and went down unto Arabah:"
6,18,19,"And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah: and the end of the border was at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south border."
6,18,20,"And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the boundaries all around, according to their families."
6,18,21,"Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and Emikkeziz."
6,18,22,"And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,"

6,19,9,"Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within their inheritance."
6,19,10,"And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:"
6,19,11,"And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth, and reached to the brook that is east of Jokneam;"
6,19,12,"And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sun rising unto the border of Chislothtabor, and then goes out to Daberath, and then up to Japhia."

6,19,48,"This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages."
6,19,49,"When they had finished dividing the land for inheritance according to their borders, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:"
6,19,50,"According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city for which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein."
6,19,51,"These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. So they finished dividing the country."
6,20,1,"The LORD also spoke unto Joshua, saying,"

6,20,3,""
6,20,4,""
6,20,5,""
6,20,6,""
6,20,7,"And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kiriatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah."

6,20,9,"These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourns among them, that whosoever kills any person accidentally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation."
6,21,1,"Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;"
6,21,2,"And they spoke unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the pasture lands for our cattle."
6,21,3,"And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their pasture lands."

6,21,44,"And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand."
6,21,45,"There failed not any of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass."
6,22,1,"Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,"
6,22,2,"And said unto them, you have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:"
6,22,3,"You have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God."
6,22,4,"And now the LORD your God has given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of Jordan."
6,22,5,"But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."
6,22,6,"So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents."
6,22,7,"Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side of Jordan, westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,"
6,22,8,"And he spoke unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with bronze, and with iron, and with very much clothing: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren."
6,22,9,"And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they had possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses."
6,22,10,"And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to see."
6,22,11,"And the children of Israel were told, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar near the border of the land of Canaan, in the area of the Jordan, on the side of the children of Israel."
6,22,12,"And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them."
6,22,13,"And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,"
6,22,14,"And with him ten leaders, of each chief house a leader throughout all the tribes of Israel; and every one was a head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel."
6,22,15,"And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,"
6,22,16,"Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that you have built you an altar, that you might rebel this day against the LORD?"
6,22,17,"Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,"
6,22,18,"But that you must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing you rebel today against the LORD, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel."
6,22,19,"Nevertheless, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, in which the LORD'S tabernacle dwells, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of the LORD our God."
6,22,20,"Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity."
6,22,21,"Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,"
6,22,22,"The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knows, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)"
6,22,23,"That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offerings or grain offerings, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require an account;"
6,22,24,"And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have you to do with the LORD God of Israel?"
6,22,25,"For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD."
6,22,26,"Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:"
6,22,27,"But that it may be a witness between us and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, you have no part in the LORD."
6,22,28,"Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you."
6,22,29,"God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for grain offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle."
6,22,30,"And when Phinehas the priest, and the leaders of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them."
6,22,31,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD."
6,22,32,"And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the leaders, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again."
6,22,33,"And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt."
6,22,34,"And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God."
6,23,1,"And it came to pass a long time after the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua grew old and stricken in age."
6,23,2,"And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:"
6,23,3,"And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that has fought for you."
6,23,4,"Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the Great Sea westward."
6,23,5,"And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and you shall possess their land, as the LORD your God has promised unto you."
6,23,6,"Be you therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that you turn not aside from it to the right hand or to the left;"
6,23,7,"That you mix not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:"
6,23,8,"But cleave unto the LORD your God, as you have done unto this day."
6,23,9,"For the LORD has driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man has been able to stand before you unto this day."
6,23,10,"One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fights for you, as he has promised you."
6,23,11,"Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that you love the LORD your God."
6,23,12,"Else if you do in any way go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:"
6,23,13,"Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you."
6,23,14,"And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing has failed thereof."
6,23,15,"Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he has destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you."
6,23,16,"When you have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which he has given unto you."
6,24,1,"And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God."
6,24,2,"And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus says the LORD God of Israel,"

6,24,14,"Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River, and in Egypt; and serve you the LORD."
6,24,15,"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."
6,24,16,"And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;"
6,24,17,"For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:"
6,24,18,"And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God."
6,24,19,"And Joshua said unto the people, You cannot serve the LORD: for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins."
6,24,20,"If you forsake the LORD, and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after that he has done you good."
6,24,21,"And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD."
6,24,22,"And Joshua said unto the people, You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses."
6,24,23,"Now therefore put away, said he, the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel."
6,24,24,"And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey."
6,24,25,"So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem."
6,24,26,"And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD."
6,24,27,"And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it has heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest you deny your God."
6,24,28,"So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance."
6,24,29,"And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old."
6,24,30,"And they buried him within the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash."
6,24,31,"And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and who had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel."
6,24,32,"And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph."
6,24,33,"And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that belonged to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim."
7,1,1,"Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?"
7,1,2,"And the LORD said,"
7,1,3,"And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my allotted portion, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your allotted portion. So Simeon went with him."
7,1,4,"And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men."

7,1,6,"But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes."
7,1,7,"And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered scraps under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died."
7,1,8,"Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire."

7,1,14,"And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she got down from her donkey; and Caleb said unto her, What do you want?"
7,1,15,"And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for you have given me the south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs."
7,1,16,"And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies to the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people."
7,1,17,"And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah."
7,1,18,"Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Askelon with its border, and Ekron with its border."
7,1,19,"And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron."
7,1,20,"And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled from there the three sons of Anak."
7,1,21,"And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem until this day."
7,1,22,"And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them."

7,1,24,"And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city, and we will show you mercy."
7,1,25,"And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family."
7,1,26,"And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is its name until this day."

7,1,33,"Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became forced laborers unto them."
7,1,34,"And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not allow them to come down to the valley:"
7,1,35,"But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became forced laborers."
7,1,36,"And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward."

7,2,13,"And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth."
7,2,14,"And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of plunderers that plundered them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies."
7,2,15,"Wherever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed."
7,2,16,"Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, who delivered them out of the hand of those that plundered them."
7,2,17,"And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they played the harlot with other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so."
7,2,18,"And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for the LORD had compassion because of their groanings because of them that oppressed them and vexed them."
7,2,19,"And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way."
7,2,20,"And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,"

7,2,22,""
7,2,23,"Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua."
7,3,1,"Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to test Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;"
7,3,2,"Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at least those who before knew nothing thereof;"
7,3,3,"Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entrance of Hamath."
7,3,4,"And they were to test Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses."
7,3,5,"And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:"
7,3,6,"And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods."
7,3,7,"And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the idol poles."
7,3,8,"Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years."
7,3,9,"And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother."
7,3,10,"And the spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim."
7,3,11,"And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died."
7,3,12,"And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD."
7,3,13,"And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and struck Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees."
7,3,14,"So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years."
7,3,15,"But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left-handed: and by him the children of Israel sent tribute unto Eglon the king of Moab."
7,3,16,"But Ehud made himself a dagger which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he did gird it under his clothes upon his right thigh."
7,3,17,"And he brought the tribute unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man."
7,3,18,"And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people that bore the tribute."
7,3,19,"But he himself turned back at the stone images that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret message unto you, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him."
7,3,20,"And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer chamber, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto you. And he arose out of his seat."
7,3,21,"And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:"
7,3,22,"And the hilt also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and his entrails came out."
7,3,23,"Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the chamber behind him, and locked them."
7,3,24,"When he had gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, Surely he is relieving himself in his summer chamber."
7,3,25,"And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the chamber; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the floor."
7,3,26,"And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the stone images, and escaped unto Seirath."
7,3,27,"And it came to pass, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he was before them."
7,3,28,"And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and allowed not a man to pass over."
7,3,29,"And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all strong, and all men of valor; and there escaped not a man."
7,3,30,"So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years."
7,3,31,"And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel."
7,4,1,"And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead."
7,4,2,"And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the nations."
7,4,3,"And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and for twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel."
7,4,4,"And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time."
7,4,5,"And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment."
7,4,6,"And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh in Naphtali, and said unto him, Has not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying,"
7,4,7,""
7,4,8,"And Barak said unto her, If you will go with me, then I will go: but if you will not go with me, then I will not go."
7,4,9,"And she said, I will surely go with you: nevertheless the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh."
7,4,10,"And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him."
7,4,11,"Now Heber the Kenite, who was of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent as far as the oak of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh."
7,4,12,"And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor."
7,4,13,"And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the nations to the river of Kishon."
7,4,14,"And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand: is not the LORD gone out before you? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him."
7,4,15,"And the LORD routed Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera got down from his chariot, and fled away on foot."
7,4,16,"But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, unto Harosheth of the nations: and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left."
7,4,17,"However Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite."
7,4,18,"And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a rug."
7,4,19,"And he said unto her, Give me, I pray you, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a skin of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him."
7,4,20,"Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man does come and inquire of you, and say, Is there any man here? that you shall say, No."
7,4,21,"Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and drove the peg into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died."
7,4,22,"And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the peg was in his temples."
7,4,23,"So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel."
7,4,24,"And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan."
7,5,1,"Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,"
7,5,2,"Praise you the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves."
7,5,3,"Hear, O you kings; give ear, O you princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel."
7,5,4,"LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water."
7,5,5,"The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel."
7,5,6,"In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways."
7,5,7,"The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel."
7,5,8,"They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?"
7,5,9,"My heart is toward the rulers of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless you the LORD."
7,5,10,"Speak, you that ride on white donkeys, you that sit in judgment, and walk by the way."
7,5,11,"They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates."
7,5,12,"Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead your captives captive, you son of Abinoam."
7,5,13,"Then he made him that remains have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty."
7,5,14,"Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after you, Benjamin, among your people; out of Machir came down rulers, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer."
7,5,15,"And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great resolves of heart."
7,5,16,"Why abode you among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart."
7,5,17,"Gilead abode beyond the Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode by his inlets."
7,5,18,"Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field."
7,5,19,"The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money."
7,5,20,"They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera."
7,5,21,"The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, you have trodden down strength."
7,5,22,"Then were the horsesâ€™ hoofs thundering by means of the gallopings, the gallopings of their mighty ones."
7,5,23,"Curse you Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, Curse you bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty."
7,5,24,"Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent."
7,5,25,"He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish."
7,5,26,"She put her hand to the tent peg, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she struck Sisera, she crushed his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples."
7,5,27,"At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead."
7,5,28,"The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?"
7,5,29,"Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,"

7,5,31,"So let all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when it goes forth in its might. And the land had rest forty years."
7,6,1,"And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years."
7,6,2,"And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made themselves the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strongholds."

7,6,29,"And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing."
7,6,30,"Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die: because he has cast down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the idol pole that was by it."
7,6,31,"And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will you plead for Baal? will you save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death while it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one has cast down his altar."
7,6,32,"Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he has thrown down his altar."
7,6,33,"Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel."
7,6,34,"But the spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him."
7,6,35,"And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them."
7,6,36,"And Gideon said unto God, If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said,"
7,6,37,"Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside it, then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said."
7,6,38,"And it was so: for he rose up early the next day, and squeezed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water."
7,6,39,"And Gideon said unto God, Let not your anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me test, I pray you, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew."
7,6,40,"And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground."
7,7,1,"Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and encamped beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley."
7,7,2,"And the LORD said unto Gideon,"
7,7,3,""
7,7,4,"And the LORD said unto Gideon,"
7,7,5,"So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon,"
7,7,6,"And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water."
7,7,7,"And the LORD said unto Gideon,"
7,7,8,"So the people took provisions in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley."
7,7,9,"And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,"
7,7,10,""
7,7,11,""
7,7,12,"And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude."
7,7,13,"And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and struck it so that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay flat."
7,7,14,"And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else except the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand has God delivered Midian, and all the host."
7,7,15,"And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshiped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD has delivered into your hand the host of Midian."
7,7,16,"And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers."
7,7,17,"And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall you do."
7,7,18,"When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon."
7,7,19,"So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hands."
7,7,20,"And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon."
7,7,21,"And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled."
7,7,22,"And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath."
7,7,23,"And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites."
7,7,24,"And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan."
7,7,25,"And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of Jordan."
7,8,1,"And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why have you served us thus, that you called us not, when you went to fight with the Midianites? And they did argue with him sharply."
7,8,2,"And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison to you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?"
7,8,3,"God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison to you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that."
7,8,4,"And Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them."
7,8,5,"And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian."
7,8,6,"And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread unto your army?"
7,8,7,"And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."
7,8,8,"And he went up there to Penuel, and spoke unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him."
7,8,9,"And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."
7,8,10,"Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew the sword."
7,8,11,"And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the host: for the host felt secure."
7,8,12,"And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed all the host."
7,8,13,"And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,"
7,8,14,"And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men."
7,8,15,"And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna with whom you did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread unto your men that are weary?"
7,8,16,"And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth."
7,8,17,"And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city."
7,8,18,"Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom you slew at Tabor? And they answered, As you are, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king."
7,8,19,"And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not slay you."
7,8,20,"And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth."
7,8,21,"Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks."
7,8,22,"Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule you over us, both you, and your son, and your son's son also: for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian."
7,8,23,"And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you."
7,8,24,"And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that you would give me every man the earrings of his spoil. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)"
7,8,25,"And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his spoil."
7,8,26,"And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks."
7,8,27,"And Gideon made an ephod of it, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went there and played the harlot with it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house."
7,8,28,"Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon."
7,8,29,"And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house."
7,8,30,"And Gideon had threescore and ten sons, his own offspring: for he had many wives."
7,8,31,"And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech."
7,8,32,"And Gideon the son of Joash died at a good old age, and was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites."
7,8,33,"And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and played the harlot after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god."
7,8,34,"And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:"
7,8,35,"Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had showed unto Israel."
7,9,1,"And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and spoke with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,"
7,9,2,"Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Which is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh."
7,9,3,"And his mother's brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother."
7,9,4,"And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless persons, who followed him."
7,9,5,"And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: nevertheless yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself."
7,9,6,"And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem."
7,9,7,"And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, you men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you."
7,9,8,"The trees went forth once to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign you over us."
7,9,9,"But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
7,9,10,"And the trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us."
7,9,11,"But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
7,9,12,"Then said the trees unto the vine, Come you, and reign over us."
7,9,13,"And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheers God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?"
7,9,14,"Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come you, and reign over us."
7,9,15,"And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon."
7,9,16,"Now therefore, if you have done truly and sincerely, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;"
7,9,17,"(For my father fought for you, and risked his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:"
7,9,18,"And you are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)"
7,9,19,"If you then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:"
7,9,20,"But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech."
7,9,21,"And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother."
7,9,22,"When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,"
7,9,23,"Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:"
7,9,24,"That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, who aided him in the killing of his brethren."
7,9,25,"And the men of Shechem set men in ambush for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech."
7,9,26,"And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him."
7,9,27,"And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech."
7,9,28,"And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?"
7,9,29,"And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase your army, and come out."
7,9,30,"And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled."
7,9,31,"And he sent messengers unto Abimelech secretly, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against you."
7,9,32,"Now therefore come up by night, you and the people that are with you, and lie in wait in the field:"
7,9,33,"And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion."
7,9,34,"And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid in wait against Shechem in four companies."
7,9,35,"And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait."
7,9,36,"And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, you see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men."
7,9,37,"And Gaal spoke again and said, See there come people down from the middle of the land, and another company comes along by the oak of Meonenim."
7,9,38,"Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now your mouth, with which you said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that you have despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them."
7,9,39,"And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech."
7,9,40,"And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entrance of the gate."
7,9,41,"And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem."
7,9,42,"And it came to pass the next day, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech."
7,9,43,"And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and struck them."
7,9,44,"And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them."
7,9,45,"And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt."
7,9,46,"And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into a stronghold of the house of the god Berith."
7,9,47,"And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together."
7,9,48,"And Abimelech went up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done."
7,9,49,"And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them against the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire over them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women."
7,9,50,"Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it."
7,9,51,"But there was a strong tower within the city, and there fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and went up to the top of the tower."
7,9,52,"And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went near unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire."
7,9,53,"And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and broke his skull."
7,9,54,"Then he called hastily unto the young man his armorbearer, and said unto him, Draw your sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died."
7,9,55,"And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place."
7,9,56,"Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:"
7,9,57,"And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal."
7,10,1,"And after Abimelech there arose to deliver Israel Tola the son of Puah the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim."
7,10,2,"And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir."
7,10,3,"And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years."
7,10,4,"And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty donkey colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead."
7,10,5,"And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon."
7,10,6,"And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him."
7,10,7,"And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon."
7,10,8,"And that year they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead."
7,10,9,"Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was greatly distressed."
7,10,10,"And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against you, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim."
7,10,11,"And the LORD said unto the children of Israel,"
7,10,12,""
7,10,13,""
7,10,14,""
7,10,15,"And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do you unto us whatsoever seems good unto you; deliver us only, we pray you, this day."
7,10,16,"And they put away the foreign gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel."
7,10,17,"Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah."
7,10,18,"And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
7,11,1,"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah."
7,11,2,"And Gilead's wife bore him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, you shall not inherit in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman."
7,11,3,"Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered worthless men to Jephthah, and went out with him."
7,11,4,"And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel."
7,11,5,"And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob:"
7,11,6,"And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon."
7,11,7,"And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not you hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are you come unto me now when you are in distress?"
7,11,8,"And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
7,11,9,"And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?"
7,11,10,"And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to your words."
7,11,11,"Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpah."
7,11,12,"And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come against me to fight in my land?"
7,11,13,"And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably."
7,11,14,"And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:"
7,11,15,"And said unto him, Thus says Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:"
7,11,16,"But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;"
7,11,17,"Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray you, pass through your land: but the king of Edom would not listen. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh."
7,11,18,"Then they went along through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and encamped on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab."
7,11,19,"And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray you, through your land into my place."
7,11,20,"But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his territory: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel."
7,11,21,"And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country."
7,11,22,"And they possessed all the territory of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan."
7,11,23,"So now the LORD God of Israel has driven out the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess it?"
7,11,24,"Will you not possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess."
7,11,25,"And now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,"
7,11,26,"While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are along by the borders of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did you not recover them within that time?"
7,11,27,"Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon."
7,11,28,"However the king of the children of Ammon heeded not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him."
7,11,29,"Then the spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon."
7,11,30,"And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If you shall without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,"
7,11,31,"Then it shall be, that whatsoever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering."
7,11,32,"So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands."
7,11,33,"And he crushed them from Aroer, even till you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel."
7,11,34,"And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter."
7,11,35,"And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you are one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back."
7,11,36,"And she said unto him, My father, if you have opened your mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth; since the LORD has taken vengeance for you of your enemies, even of the children of Ammon."
7,11,37,"And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and lament my virginity, I and my companions."
7,11,38,"And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and lamented her virginity upon the mountains."
7,11,39,"And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,"
7,11,40,"That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year."
7,12,1,"And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Why passed you over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? we will burn your house upon you with fire."
7,12,2,"And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you delivered me not out of their hands."
7,12,3,"And when I saw that you delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: why then are you come up unto me this day, to fight against me?"
7,12,4,"Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead struck down Ephraim, because they said, You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites."
7,12,5,"And the Gileadites took the fords of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so that when those Ephraimites who were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, are you an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;"
7,12,6,"Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the fords of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand."
7,12,7,"And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead."
7,12,8,"And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel."
7,12,9,"And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent outside for marriage, and took in thirty daughters from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years."
7,12,10,"Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem."
7,12,11,"And after him Elon, a Zebulunite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years."
7,12,12,"And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun."
7,12,13,"And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel."
7,12,14,"And he had forty sons and thirty grandsons, that rode on threescore and ten donkey colts: and he judged Israel eight years."
7,12,15,"And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites."
7,13,1,"And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years."
7,13,2,"And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not."
7,13,3,"And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, you are barren, and bear not: but you shall conceive, and bear a son."
7,13,4,"Now therefore beware, I pray you, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:"
7,13,5,"For, lo, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines."
7,13,6,"Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very awesome: but I asked him not from where he was, neither told he me his name:"
7,13,7,"But he said unto me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death."
7,13,8,"Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God whom you did send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born."
7,13,9,"And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her."
7,13,10,"And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man has appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day."
7,13,11,"And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, are you the man that spoke unto the woman? And he said, I am."
7,13,12,"And Manoah said, Now let your words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?"
7,13,13,"And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware."
7,13,14,"She may not eat of any thing that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe."
7,13,15,"And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray you, let us detain you, until we shall have made ready a kid for you."
7,13,16,"And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though you detain me, I will not eat of your food: and if you will offer a burnt offering, you must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD."
7,13,17,"And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is your name, that when your sayings come to pass we may do you honor?"
7,13,18,"And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why ask you thus after my name, seeing it is wonderful?"
7,13,19,"So Manoah took a kid with a grain offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did a wondrous thing; and Manoah and his wife looked on."
7,13,20,"For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground."
7,13,21,"But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD."
7,13,22,"And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God."
7,13,23,"But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a grain offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told us such things as these."
7,13,24,"And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him."
7,13,25,"And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol."
7,14,1,"And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines."
7,14,2,"And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me as a wife."
7,14,3,"Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there no woman among the daughters of your brethren, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleases me well."
7,14,4,"But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel."
7,14,5,"Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him."
7,14,6,"And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he tore him as he would have torn a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done."
7,14,7,"And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well."
7,14,8,"And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion."
7,14,9,"And he took some of it in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion."
7,14,10,"So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do."
7,14,11,"And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him."
7,14,12,"And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if you can certainly declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing:"
7,14,13,"But if you cannot declare it to me, then shall you give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. And they said unto him, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it."
7,14,14,"And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle."
7,14,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire: have you called us to take what we have? is it not so?"
7,14,16,"And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, You do but hate me, and love me not: you have put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and have not told it to me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it to my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it to you?"
7,14,17,"And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him so: and she told the riddle to the children of her people."
7,14,18,"And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle."
7,14,19,"And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave changes of clothing unto them who expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house."
7,14,20,"But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his best man."
7,15,1,"But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not allow him to go in."
7,15,2,"And her father said, I verily thought that you had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray you, instead of her."
7,15,3,"And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them harm."
7,15,4,"And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between two tails."
7,15,5,"And when he had set the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing grain, with the vineyards and olives."
7,15,6,"Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire."
7,15,7,"And Samson said unto them, Though you have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease."
7,15,8,"And he struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock of Etam."
7,15,9,"Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi."
7,15,10,"And the men of Judah said, Why are you come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he has done to us."
7,15,11,"Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Know you not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that you have done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them."
7,15,12,"And they said unto him, We are come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that you will not fall upon me yourselves."
7,15,13,"And they spoke unto him, saying, No; but we will bind you securely, and deliver you into their hand: but surely we will not kill you. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock."
7,15,14,"And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands."
7,15,15,"And he found a new jawbone of a donkey, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men with it."
7,15,16,"And Samson said, With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey have I slain a thousand men."
7,15,17,"And it came to pass, when he had finished speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi."
7,15,18,"And he was very thirsty, and called on the LORD, and said, you have given this great deliverance into the hand of your servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?"
7,15,19,"But God split a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water out of it; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: therefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day."
7,15,20,"And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years."
7,16,1,"Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in unto her."
7,16,2,"And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson has come here. And they surrounded the place, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him."
7,16,3,"And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of a hill that is before Hebron."
7,16,4,"And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah."
7,16,5,"And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see where his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will all give you eleven hundred pieces of silver."
7,16,6,"And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray you, where your great strength lies, and with what you might be bound to afflict you."
7,16,7,"And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."
7,16,8,"Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them."
7,16,9,"Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon you, Samson. And he broke the cords, as a thread of yarn is broken when it touches the fire. So his strength was not known."
7,16,10,"And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray you, how you might be bound."
7,16,11,"And he said unto her, If they bind me securely with new ropes that never were used, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."
7,16,12,"Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him with them, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon you, Samson. And there were men lying in wait abiding in the chamber. And he broke them from off his arms like a thread."
7,16,13,"And Delilah said unto Samson, Until now you have mocked me, and told me lies: tell me how you might be bound. And he said unto her, If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web."
7,16,14,"And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon you, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web."
7,16,15,"And she said unto him, How can you say, I love you, when your heart is not with me? you have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies."
7,16,16,"And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;"
7,16,17,"That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There has not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man."
7,16,18,"And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he has showed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand."
7,16,19,"And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him."
7,16,20,"And she said, The Philistines be upon you, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he knew not that the LORD was departed from him."
7,16,21,"But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of bronze; and he did grind in the prison house."
7,16,22,"However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven."
7,16,23,"Then the lords of the Philistines gathered themselves together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand."
7,16,24,"And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, who slew many of us."
7,16,25,"And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make sport for us. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made sport for them: and they set him between the pillars."
7,16,26,"And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Allow me that I may feel the pillars upon which the house stands, that I may lean upon them."
7,16,27,"Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport."
7,16,28,"And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray you, and strengthen me, I pray you, only this once, O God, that I may be avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes."
7,16,29,"And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of one with his right hand, and of the other with his left."
7,16,30,"And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead whom he slew at his death were more than they whom he slew in his life."
7,16,31,"Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years."
7,17,1,"And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah."
7,17,2,"And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, about which you cursed, and spoke of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my son."
7,17,3,"And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto you."
7,17,4,"Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the silversmith, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah."
7,17,5,"And the man Micah had a shrine, and made an ephod, and household gods, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest."
7,17,6,"In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes."
7,17,7,"And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there."
7,17,8,"And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed."
7,17,9,"And Micah said unto him, From where come you? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place."
7,17,10,"And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten shekels of silver a year, and a suit of apparel, and your living. So the Levite went in."
7,17,11,"And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons."
7,17,12,"And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah."
7,17,13,"Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite as my priest."
7,18,1,"In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought themselves an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel."
7,18,2,"And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their territory, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there."
7,18,3,"When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in there, and said unto him, Who brought you here? and what are you doing in this place? and what do you have here?"
7,18,4,"And he said unto them, Thus and thus deals Micah with me, and has hired me, and I am his priest."
7,18,5,"And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous."
7,18,6,"And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: the LORD is before your way in which you go."
7,18,7,"Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were there, how they dwelt safely, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might shame them in anything; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man."
7,18,8,"And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say you?"
7,18,9,"And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are you still here? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land."
7,18,10,"When you go, you shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God has given it into your hands; a place where there is no lack of any thing that is in the earth."
7,18,11,"And there went from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war."
7,18,12,"And they went up, and encamped in Kiriathjearim, in Judah: therefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is west of Kiriathjearim."
7,18,13,"And they passed from there unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah."
7,18,14,"Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and household gods, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do."
7,18,15,"And they turned aside there, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and greeted him."
7,18,16,"And the six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate."
7,18,17,"And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the household gods, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men that were armed with weapons of war."
7,18,18,"And these went into Micah's house, and took the carved image, the ephod, and the household gods, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What are you doing?"
7,18,19,"And they said unto him, Hold your peace, lay your hand upon your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?"
7,18,20,"And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the household gods, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people."
7,18,21,"So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods in front of them."
7,18,22,"And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan."
7,18,23,"And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What ails you, that you come with such a company?"
7,18,24,"And he said, you have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and you are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that you say unto me, What ails you?"
7,18,25,"And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household."
7,18,26,"And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house."
7,18,27,"And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest that he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were quiet and secure: and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire."
7,18,28,"And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt in it."
7,18,29,"And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: however the name of the city was Laish at the first."
7,18,30,"And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land."
7,18,31,"And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh."
7,19,1,"And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah."
7,19,2,"And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months."
7,19,3,"And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of donkeys: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the young woman saw him, he rejoiced to meet him."
7,19,4,"And his father-in-law, the young womanâ€™s father, detained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there."
7,19,5,"And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the young woman's father said unto his son-in-law, Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way."
7,19,6,"And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the young womanâ€™s father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray you, and tarry all night, and let your heart be merry."
7,19,7,"And when the man rose up to depart, his father-in-law urged him: therefore he lodged there again."
7,19,8,"And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the young womanâ€™s father said, Refresh your heart, I pray you. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them."
7,19,9,"And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the young womanâ€™s father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow get you early on your way, that you may go home."
7,19,10,"But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over opposite Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two donkeys saddled, his concubine also was with him."
7,19,11,"And when they were near Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray you, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it."
7,19,12,"And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside here into the city of strangers, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah."
7,19,13,"And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah."
7,19,14,"And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin."
7,19,15,"And they turned aside there, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat himself down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge."
7,19,16,"And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening, who was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites."
7,19,17,"And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, where do you go? and from where do you come?"
7,19,18,"And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from there am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receives me into his house."
7,19,19,"Yet there is both straw and fodder for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid, and for the young man who is with your servants: there is no lack of any thing."
7,19,20,"And the old man said, Peace be with you; however let all your needs lie upon me; only lodge not in the street."
7,19,21,"So he brought him into his house, and gave fodder unto the donkeys: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink."
7,19,22,"Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into your house, that we may know him."
7,19,23,"And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly."
7,19,24,"Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with them what seems good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing."
7,19,25,"But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to dawn, they let her go."
7,19,26,"Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light."
7,19,27,"And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold."
7,19,28,"And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But there was no answer. Then the man took her up upon a donkey, and the man rose up, and got himself unto his place."
7,19,29,"And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the territory of Israel."
7,19,30,"And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider it, take counsel, and speak your minds."
7,20,1,"Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpah."
7,20,2,"And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword."
7,20,3,"(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpah.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?"
7,20,4,"And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge."
7,20,5,"And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they so ravished, that she is dead."
7,20,6,"And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and abomination in Israel."
7,20,7,"Behold, you are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel."
7,20,8,"And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house."
7,20,9,"But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it;"
7,20,10,"And we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to bring food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the abomination that they have done in Israel."
7,20,11,"So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united together as one man."
7,20,12,"And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?"
7,20,13,"Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel:"
7,20,14,"But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel."
7,20,15,"And the children of Benjamin numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred chosen men."
7,20,16,"Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men, left-handed; every one could sling stones at a hairâ€™s breadth, and not miss."
7,20,17,"And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war."
7,20,18,"And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Who of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first."
7,20,19,"And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah."
7,20,20,"And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah."
7,20,21,"And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and cut down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men."
7,20,22,"And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day."
7,20,23,"(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said,"
7,20,24,"And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day."
7,20,25,"And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and cut down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword."
7,20,26,"Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD."
7,20,27,"And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,"
7,20,28,"And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said,"
7,20,29,"And Israel set men in ambush round about Gibeah."
7,20,30,"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times."
7,20,31,"And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, by which one goes up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel."
7,20,32,"And the children of Benjamin said, They are struck down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways."
7,20,33,"And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the men in ambush from Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah."
7,20,34,"And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was fierce: but Benjamin knew not that evil was near them."
7,20,35,"And the LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these drew the sword."
7,20,36,"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the men in ambush which they had set beside Gibeah."
7,20,37,"And the men in ambush hastened, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the men in ambush moved out, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword."
7,20,38,"Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the men in ambush, that they should make a great flame with smoke rising up out of the city."
7,20,39,"And when the men of Israel retreated in the battle, Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle."
7,20,40,"But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven."
7,20,41,"And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them."
7,20,42,"Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and those who came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them."
7,20,43,"Thus they surrounded the Benjamites, and chased them, and trod them down with ease opposite Gibeah toward the east."
7,20,44,"And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor."
7,20,45,"And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they cut down of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them."
7,20,46,"So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor."
7,20,47,"But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months."
7,20,48,"And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword, the men of every city, as also the beasts, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to."
7,21,1,"Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin as wife."
7,21,2,"And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept greatly;"
7,21,3,"And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?"
7,21,4,"And it came to pass the next day, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings."
7,21,5,"And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death."
7,21,6,"And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day."
7,21,7,"What shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters as wives?"
7,21,8,"And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpah to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly."
7,21,9,"For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there."
7,21,10,"And the congregation sent there twelve thousand of the most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children."
7,21,11,"And this is the thing that you shall do, you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that has lain with a man."
7,21,12,"And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan."
7,21,13,"And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them."
7,21,14,"And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet they did not suffice for them."
7,21,15,"And the people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel."
7,21,16,"Then the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?"
7,21,17,"And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel."
7,21,18,"However we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that gives a wife to Benjamin."
7,21,19,"Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah."
7,21,20,"Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;"
7,21,21,"And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come you out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin."
7,21,22,"And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favorable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for you did not give unto them at this time, that you should be guilty."
7,21,23,"And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them."
7,21,24,"And the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance."
7,21,25,"In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes."
8,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons."
8,1,2,"And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there."
8,1,3,"And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons."
8,1,4,"And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years."
8,1,5,"And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left without her two sons and her husband."
8,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them food."
8,1,7,"Therefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah."
8,1,8,"And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me."
8,1,9,"The LORD grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voices, and wept."
8,1,10,"And they said unto her, Surely we will return with you unto your people."
8,1,11,"And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will you go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
8,1,12,"Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have a husband also tonight, and should also bear sons;"
8,1,13,"Would you tarry for them till they were grown? would you refrain from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieves me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me."
8,1,14,"And they lifted up their voices, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth clung to her."
8,1,15,"And she said, Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return you after your sister-in-law."
8,1,16,"And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave you, or to return from following after you: for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge: your people shall be my people, and your God my God:"
8,1,17,"Where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts you and me."
8,1,18,"When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she ceased speaking unto her."
8,1,19,"So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was stirred because of them, and they said, Is this Naomi?"
8,1,20,"And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me."
8,1,21,"I went out full, and the LORD has brought me home again empty: why then call you me Naomi, seeing the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?"
8,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest."
8,2,1,"And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz."
8,2,2,"And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter."
8,2,3,"And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to come to a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech."
8,2,4,"And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless you."
8,2,5,"Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose young woman is this?"
8,2,6,"And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabite young woman that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:"
8,2,7,"And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she tarried a little in the house."
8,2,8,"Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Will you not hear, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from here, but abide here close by my maidens:"
8,2,9,"Let your eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch you? and when you are thirsty, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn."
8,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in your eyes, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?"
8,2,11,"And Boaz answered and said unto her, It has fully been shown me, all that you have done unto your mother-in-law since the death of your husband: and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and are come unto a people which you knew not before."
8,2,12,"The LORD recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to trust."
8,2,13,"Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord; for you have comforted me, and you have spoken kindly unto your handmaid, though I be not like unto one of your handmaidens."
8,2,14,"And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he passed to her parched grain, and she did eat, and was satisfied, and left."
8,2,15,"And when she rose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:"
8,2,16,"And let fall also some of the handfuls on purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not."
8,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out what she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley."
8,2,18,"And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her what she had reserved after she was satisfied."
8,2,19,"And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where have you gleaned today? and where did you work? blessed be he that did take knowledge of you. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz."
8,2,20,"And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our closest kinsmen."
8,2,21,"And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, You shall keep near by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest."
8,2,22,"And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, that they encounter you not in any other field."
8,2,23,"So she kept close by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother-in-law."
8,3,1,"Then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?"
8,3,2,"And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshingfloor."
8,3,3,"Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself, and put your best clothes upon you, and get down to the floor: but make not yourself known unto the man, until he shall have finished eating and drinking."
8,3,4,"And it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay down; and he will tell you what you shall do."
8,3,5,"And she said unto her, All that you say unto me I will do."
8,3,6,"And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her."
8,3,7,"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid herself down."
8,3,8,"And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was startled, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet."
8,3,9,"And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman."
8,3,10,"And he said, Blessed be you of the LORD, my daughter: for you have showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, in that you followed not young men, whether poor or rich."
8,3,11,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to you all that you require: for all the city of my people does know that you are a virtuous woman."
8,3,12,"And now it is true that I am your near kinsman: however there is a kinsman nearer than I."
8,3,13,"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as the LORD lives: lie down until the morning."
8,3,14,"And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could recognize another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor."
8,3,15,"Also he said, Bring the cloak that you have upon you, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city."
8,3,16,"And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, How are you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her."
8,3,17,"And she said, These six measures of barley he gave me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto your mother-in-law."
8,3,18,"Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall: for the man will not rest, until he has finished the thing this day."
8,4,1,"Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down."
8,4,2,"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit down here. And they sat down."
8,4,3,"And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, sells a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:"
8,4,4,"And I thought to advise you, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it."
8,4,5,"Then said Boaz, The day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead through his inheritance."
8,4,6,"And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance: redeem you my right to yourself; for I cannot redeem it."
8,4,7,"Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, for to confirm all things; a man took off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a testimony in Israel."
8,4,8,"Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for yourself. So he took off his shoe."
8,4,9,"And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi."
8,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead through his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of this place: you are witnesses this day."
8,4,11,"And all the people that were at the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and may you do worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:"
8,4,12,"And let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore unto Judah, of the children which the LORD shall give you of this young woman."
8,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son."
8,4,14,"And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel."
8,4,15,"And he shall be unto you a restorer of your life, and a nourisher of your old age: for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him."
8,4,16,"And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it."
8,4,17,"And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David."
8,4,18,"Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begat Hezron,"
8,4,19,"And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,"
8,4,20,"And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,"
8,4,21,"And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,"
8,4,22,"And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David."
9,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:"
9,1,2,"And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
9,1,3,"And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there."
9,1,4,"And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:"
9,1,5,"But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb."
9,1,6,"And her adversary also provoked her severely to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb."
9,1,7,"And as year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat."
9,1,8,"Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why eat you not? and why is your heart grieved? am not I better to you than ten sons?"
9,1,9,"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a door post of the temple of the LORD."
9,1,10,"And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept bitterly."
9,1,11,"And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give unto your handmaid a male child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head."
9,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli observed her mouth."
9,1,13,"Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunk."
9,1,14,"And Eli said unto her, How long will you be drunk? put away your wine from you."
9,1,15,"And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD."
9,1,16,"Count not your handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I been speaking."
9,1,17,"Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant you your petition that you have asked of him."
9,1,18,"And she said, Let your handmaid find grace in your sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad."
9,1,19,"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her."
9,1,20,"Therefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD."
9,1,21,"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow."
9,1,22,"But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide forever."
9,1,23,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seems to you good; tarry until you have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and nursed her son until she weaned him."
9,1,24,"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young."
9,1,25,"And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli."
9,1,26,"And she said, Oh my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman that stood by you here, praying unto the LORD."
9,1,27,"For this child I prayed; and the LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him:"
9,1,28,"Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshiped the LORD there."
9,2,1,"And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoices in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth boasts over my enemies; because I rejoice in your salvation."
9,2,2,"There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside you: neither is there any rock like our God."
9,2,3,"Talk no more so very proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed."
9,2,4,"The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are clothed with strength."
9,2,5,"They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased to hunger: so that the barren has borne seven; and she that has many children has grown feeble."
9,2,6,"The LORD kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up."
9,2,7,"The LORD makes poor, and makes rich: he brings low, and lifts up."
9,2,8,"He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from the rubbish, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he has set the world upon them."
9,2,9,"He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail."
9,2,10,"The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed."
9,2,11,"And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest."
9,2,12,"Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD."
9,2,13,"And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;"
9,2,14,"And he thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh, unto all the Israelites that came there."
9,2,15,"Also before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled meat from you, but raw."
9,2,16,"And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat first, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would answer him, Nay; but you shall give it to me now: and if not, I will take it by force."
9,2,17,"Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD."
9,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod."
9,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice."
9,2,20,"And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give you offspring of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home."
9,2,21,"And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD."
9,2,22,"Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of meeting."
9,2,23,"And he said unto them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all these people."
9,2,24,"Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make the LORD's people to transgress."
9,2,25,"If one man sins against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sins against the LORD, who shall intercede for him? Nevertheless they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD desired to slay them."
9,2,26,"And the child Samuel grew, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men."
9,2,27,"And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD,"

9,3,1,"And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no open vision."
9,3,2,"And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was lying down in his place, and his eyes had begun to grow dim, that he could not see;"
9,3,3,"And before the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was lying down to sleep;"
9,3,4,"That the LORD called,"
9,3,5,"And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down."
9,3,6,"And the LORD called yet again,"
9,3,7,"Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him."
9,3,8,"And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you did call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child."
9,3,9,"Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he calls you, that you shall say, Speak, LORD; for your servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place."

9,3,15,"And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to tell Eli the vision."
9,3,16,"Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I."
9,3,17,"And he said, What is the thing that the LORD has said unto you? I pray you hide it not from me: God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he said unto you."
9,3,18,"And Samuel told him everything, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seems to him good."
9,3,19,"And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground."
9,3,20,"And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD."
9,3,21,"And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD."
9,4,1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek."
9,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was defeated before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men."
9,4,3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it comes among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies."
9,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who dwells between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God."
9,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again."
9,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What is the meaning of the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp."
9,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there has not been such a thing before this."
9,4,8,"Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that struck the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness."
9,4,9,"Be strong, and conduct yourselves like men, O you Philistines, that you be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: conduct yourselves like men, and fight."
9,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen."
9,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain."
9,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn, and with earth upon his head."
9,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out."
9,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What is the meaning of the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli."
9,4,15,"Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see."
9,4,16,"And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?"
9,4,17,"And the messenger answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken."
9,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years."
9,4,19,"And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her."
9,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for you have borne a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it."
9,4,21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband."
9,4,22,"And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken."
9,5,1,"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod."
9,5,2,"When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon."
9,5,3,"And when they of Ashdod arose early the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again."
9,5,4,"And when they arose early the next day morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him."
9,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day."
9,5,6,"But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, even Ashdod and the territory thereof."
9,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is heavy upon us, and upon Dagon our god."
9,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel there."
9,5,9,"And it was so, that, after they had carried it there, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he struck the men of the city, both small and great, and they had tumors in their private parts."
9,5,10,"Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people."
9,5,11,"So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there."
9,5,12,"And the men that died not were smitten with the tumors: and the cry of the city went up to heaven."
9,6,1,"And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months."
9,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us how we shall send it to its place."
9,6,3,"And they said, If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but by all means return him a trespass offering: then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you."
9,6,4,"Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords."
9,6,5,"Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory unto the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land."
9,6,6,"Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had worked wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?"
9,6,7,"Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:"
9,6,8,"And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which you return to him for a trespass offering, in a box by the side of it; and send it away, that it may go."
9,6,9,"And see, if it goes up by the way of its own land to Bethshemesh, then he has done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us: it was by chance that it happened to us."
9,6,10,"And the men did so; and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:"
9,6,11,"And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the box with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors."
9,6,12,"And the cows took the straight way to the road to Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh."
9,6,13,"And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it."
9,6,14,"And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they split the wood of the cart, and offered the cows a burnt offering unto the LORD."
9,6,15,"And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the box that was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD."
9,6,16,"And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day."
9,6,17,"And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;"
9,6,18,"And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, on which they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remains unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite."
9,6,19,"And he struck the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he struck of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had struck many of the people with a great slaughter."
9,6,20,"And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall it go up from us?"
9,6,21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come down, and bring it up to you."
9,7,1,"And the men of Kiriathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD."
9,7,2,"And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kiriathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD."
9,7,3,"And Samuel spoke unto all the house of Israel, saying, If you do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the foreign gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."
9,7,4,"Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only."
9,7,5,"And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you unto the LORD."
9,7,6,"And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah."
9,7,7,"And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines."
9,7,8,"And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines."
9,7,9,"And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him."
9,7,10,"And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and brought confusion upon them; and they were routed before Israel."
9,7,11,"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and slaughtered them, until they came below Bethcar."
9,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Thus far has the LORD helped us."
9,7,13,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the territory of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel."
9,7,14,"And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and their territory did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites."
9,7,15,"And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life."
9,7,16,"And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places."
9,7,17,"And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD."
9,8,1,"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel."
9,8,2,"Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beersheba."
9,8,3,"And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after gain, and took bribes, and perverted justice."
9,8,4,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,"
9,8,5,"And said unto him, Behold, you are old, and your sons walk not in your ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations."
9,8,6,"But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD."
9,8,7,"And the LORD said unto Samuel,"
9,8,8,""
9,8,9,""
9,8,10,"And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king."
9,8,11,"And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots."
9,8,12,"And he will appoint himself captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his weapons of war, and equipment for his chariots."
9,8,13,"And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers."
9,8,14,"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants."
9,8,15,"And he will take the tenth of your grain, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants."
9,8,16,"And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your finest young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work."
9,8,17,"He will take the tenth of your sheep: and you shall be his servants."
9,8,18,"And you shall cry out in that day because of your king which you shall have chosen; and the LORD will not hear you in that day."
9,8,19,"Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;"
9,8,20,"That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles."
9,8,21,"And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he repeated them in the ears of the LORD."
9,8,22,"And the LORD said to Samuel,"
9,9,1,"Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power."
9,9,2,"And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and handsome: and there was not among the children of Israel a more handsome person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people."
9,9,3,"And the donkeys of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys."
9,9,4,"And he passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not."
9,9,5,"And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father cease caring for the donkeys, and become anxious for us."
9,9,6,"And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he says comes surely to pass: now let us go there; perhaps he can show us our way that we should go."
9,9,7,"Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is gone from our sacks, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?"
9,9,8,"And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way."
9,9,9,"(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was formerly called a Seer.)"
9,9,10,"Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was."
9,9,11,"And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?"
9,9,12,"And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came today to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people today in the high place:"
9,9,13,"As soon as you are come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he comes, because he does bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat who are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time you shall find him."
9,9,14,"And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place."
9,9,15,"Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,"
9,9,16,""
9,9,17,"And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him,"
9,9,18,"Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you, where the seer's house is."
9,9,19,"And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for you shall eat with me today, and tomorrow I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart."
9,9,20,"And as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, set not your mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you, and on all your father's house?"
9,9,21,"And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you so to me?"
9,9,22,"And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the chief place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons."
9,9,23,"And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said unto you, Set it by you."
9,9,24,"And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before you, and eat: for unto this time has it been kept for you since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day."
9,9,25,"And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel talked with Saul upon the top of the house."
9,9,26,"And they arose early: and it came to pass about the dawn of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send you away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, outside."
9,9,27,"And as they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand you still awhile, that I may show you the word of God."
9,10,1,"Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be ruler over his inheritance?"
9,10,2,"When you are departed from me today, then you shall find two men by Rachel's sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto you, The donkeys which you went to seek are found: and, lo, your father has left the concern of the donkeys, and sorrows for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?"
9,10,3,"Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor, and there shall meet you three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine:"
9,10,4,"And they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread; which you shall receive of their hands."
9,10,5,"After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come there to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a harp, and a tambourine, and a flute, and a lyre, before them; and they shall prophesy:"
9,10,6,"And the spirit of the LORD will come upon you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man."
9,10,7,"And let it be, when these signs are come unto you, that you do as the occasion suits you; for God is with you."
9,10,8,"And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you tarry, till I come to you, and show you what you shall do."
9,10,9,"And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day."
9,10,10,"And when they came there to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them."
9,10,11,"And it came to pass, when all that knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9,10,12,"And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9,10,13,"And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place."
9,10,14,"And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Where went you? And he said, To seek the donkeys: and when we saw that they were nowhere, we came to Samuel."
9,10,15,"And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray you, what Samuel said unto you."
9,10,16,"And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he told him not."
9,10,17,"And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpah;"
9,10,18,"And said unto the children of Israel, Thus says the LORD God of Israel,"
9,10,19,"And you have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and you have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands."
9,10,20,"And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken."
9,10,21,"When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found."
9,10,22,"Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come there. And the LORD answered,"
9,10,23,"And they ran and brought him there: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward."
9,10,24,"And Samuel said to all the people, See you him whom the LORD has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king."
9,10,25,"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house."
9,10,26,"And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched."
9,10,27,"But some worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace."
9,11,1,"Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you."
9,11,2,"And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel."
9,11,3,"And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the territory of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to you."
9,11,4,"Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept."
9,11,5,"And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What ails the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh."
9,11,6,"And the spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly."
9,11,7,"And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent."
9,11,8,"And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand."
9,11,9,"And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall you say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, Tomorrow, by that time the sun is hot, you shall have help. And the messengers came and showed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad."
9,11,10,"Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out unto you, and you shall do with us all that seems good unto you."
9,11,11,"And it was so the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they who remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together."
9,11,12,"And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death."
9,11,13,"And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for today the LORD has wrought salvation in Israel."
9,11,14,"Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there."
9,11,15,"And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly."
9,12,1,"And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that you said unto me, and have made a king over you."
9,12,2,"And now, behold, the king walks before you: and I am old and gray headed; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day."
9,12,3,"Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose donkey have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my eyes with? and I will restore it to you."
9,12,4,"And they said, you have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything of any man's hand."
9,12,5,"And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand. And they answered, He is witness."
9,12,6,"And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt."
9,12,7,"Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers."
9,12,8,"When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place."
9,12,9,"And when they forgot the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them."
9,12,10,"And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you."
9,12,11,"And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Barak, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you dwelt safely."
9,12,12,"And when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king."
9,12,13,"Now therefore behold the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have desired! and, behold, the LORD has set a king over you."
9,12,14,"If you will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both you and also the king that reigns over you continue following the LORD your God:"
9,12,15,"But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers."
9,12,16,"Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes."
9,12,17,"Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king."
9,12,18,"So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel."
9,12,19,"And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for your servants unto the LORD your God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king."
9,12,20,"And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: you have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;"
9,12,21,"And turn you not aside: for then should you go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain."
9,12,22,"For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it has pleased the LORD to make you his people."
9,12,23,"Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:"
9,12,24,"Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things he has done for you."
9,12,25,"But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king."
9,13,1,"Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,"
9,13,2,"Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent."
9,13,3,"And Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear."
9,13,4,"And all Israel heard it said that Saul had attacked a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was held in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together to Saul at Gilgal."
9,13,5,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven."
9,13,6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in danger, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits."
9,13,7,"And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling."
9,13,8,"And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him."
9,13,9,"And Saul said, Bring here a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering."
9,13,10,"And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him."
9,13,11,"And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you came not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;"
9,13,12,"Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I felt compelled therefore, and offered a burnt offering."
9,13,13,"And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly: you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which he commanded you: for now would the LORD have established your kingdom upon Israel forever."
9,13,14,"But now your kingdom shall not continue: the LORD has sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be ruler over his people, because you have not kept that which the LORD commanded you."
9,13,15,"And Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men."
9,13,16,"And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash."
9,13,17,"And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leads to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:"
9,13,18,"And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looks upon the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness."
9,13,19,"Now there was no blacksmith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:"
9,13,20,"But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, and his mattock, and his ax, and his sickle."
9,13,21,"And the charge was a third of a shekel for the plowshares, and for the mattocks, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads."
9,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son they were found."
9,13,23,"And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash."
9,14,1,"Now it came to pass one day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father."
9,14,2,"And Saul tarried in the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;"
9,14,3,"And Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone."
9,14,4,"And between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh."
9,14,5,"The front of one was located northward opposite Michmash, and the other southward opposite Geba."
9,14,6,"And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint on the LORD to save by many or by few."
9,14,7,"And his armorbearer said unto him, Do all that is in your heart: turn you; behold, I am with you according to your heart."
9,14,8,"Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will reveal ourselves unto them."
9,14,9,"If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them."
9,14,10,"But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD has delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us."
9,14,11,"And both of them revealed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves."
9,14,12,"And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armorbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of Israel."
9,14,13,"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armorbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armorbearer killed behind him."
9,14,14,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armorbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were a half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow."
9,14,15,"And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the raiders, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling."
9,14,16,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went here and there."
9,14,17,"Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there."
9,14,18,"And Saul said unto Ahijah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel."
9,14,19,"And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw your hand."
9,14,20,"And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every manâ€™s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great confusion."
9,14,21,"Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan."
9,14,22,"Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle."
9,14,23,"So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven."
9,14,24,"And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had lain an oath on the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food until evening, that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food."
9,14,25,"And all they of the land came to a forest; and there was honey upon the ground."
9,14,26,"And when the people were come into the forest, behold, the honey dripped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath."
9,14,27,"But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: therefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in a honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were brightened."
9,14,28,"Then answered one of the people, and said, your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food this day. And the people were faint."
9,14,29,"Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land: see, I ask you, how my eyes have been brightened, because I tasted a little of this honey."
9,14,30,"How much better, if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for would there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?"
9,14,31,"And they struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint."
9,14,32,"And the people rushed upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood."
9,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, you have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day."
9,14,34,"And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there."
9,14,35,"And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD."
9,14,36,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seems good unto you. Then said the priest, Let us draw near here unto God."
9,14,37,"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day."
9,14,38,"And Saul said, Draw you near here, all you leaders of the people: and know and see what this sin has been this day."
9,14,39,"For, as the LORD lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him."
9,14,40,"Then said he unto all Israel, Be you on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seems good unto you."
9,14,41,"Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped."
9,14,42,"And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken."
9,14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand, and, lo, I must die?"
9,14,44,"And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for you shall surely die, Jonathan."
9,14,45,"And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, so that he died not."
9,14,46,"Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place."
9,14,47,"So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he struck them down."
9,14,48,"And he gathered a host, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that plundered them."
9,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:"
9,14,50,"And the name of Saulâ€™s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the commander of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, Saulâ€™s uncle."
9,14,51,"And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel."
9,14,52,"And there was bitter war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him."
9,15,1,"Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken you unto the voice of the words of the LORD."
9,15,2,"Thus says the LORD of hosts,"
9,15,3,""
9,15,4,"And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah."
9,15,5,"And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley."
9,15,6,"And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites."
9,15,7,"And Saul struck down the Amalekites from Havilah until you come to Shur, that is east of Egypt."
9,15,8,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword."
9,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but everything that was despised and worthless, that they destroyed utterly."
9,15,10,"Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,"
9,15,11,""
9,15,12,"And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and has gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal."
9,15,13,"And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be you of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD."
9,15,14,"And Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"
9,15,15,"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed."
9,15,16,"Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what the LORD has said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on."
9,15,17,"And Samuel said, When you were little in your own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed you king over Israel?"
9,15,18,"And the LORD sent you on a journey, and said,"
9,15,19,"Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but did pounce upon the spoil, and did evil in the sight of the LORD?"
9,15,20,"And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites."
9,15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD your God in Gilgal."
9,15,22,"And Samuel said, has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."
9,15,23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king."
9,15,24,"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and your words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice."
9,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray you, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD."
9,15,26,"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with you: for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel."
9,15,27,"And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it tore."
9,15,28,"And Samuel said unto him, The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you."
9,15,29,"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent."
9,15,30,"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD your God."
9,15,31,"So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped the LORD."
9,15,32,"Then said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him cautiously. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past."
9,15,33,"And Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel cut Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal."
9,15,34,"Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul."
9,15,35,"And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel."
9,16,1,"And the LORD said unto Samuel,"
9,16,2,"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hears it, he will kill me. And the LORD said,"
9,16,3,""
9,16,4,"And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Come you peaceably?"
9,16,5,"And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice."
9,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORDâ€™S anointed is before him."
9,16,7,"But the LORD said unto Samuel,"
9,16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this one."
9,16,9,"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither has the LORD chosen this one."
9,16,10,"Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD has not chosen these."
9,16,11,"And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all your children? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and bring him: for we will not sit down till he comes here."
9,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and of a beautiful countenance, and handsome. And the LORD said,"
9,16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah."
9,16,14,"But the spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him."
9,16,15,"And Saulâ€™s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles you."
9,16,16,"Let our lord now command your servants, which are before you, to seek out a man, who is a skillful player on a harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well."
9,16,17,"And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me."
9,16,18,"Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is skillful in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a handsome person, and the LORD is with him."
9,16,19,"Therefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David your son, who is with the sheep."
9,16,20,"And Jesse took a donkey laden with bread, and a skin of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul."
9,16,21,"And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armorbearer."
9,16,22,"And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray you, stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight."
9,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took a harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."
9,17,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammin."
9,17,2,"And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines."
9,17,3,"And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them."
9,17,4,"And there went a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span."
9,17,5,"And he had a helmet of bronze upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze."
9,17,6,"And he had armor of bronze upon his legs, and a javelin of bronze upon his shoulders."
9,17,7,"And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him."
9,17,8,"And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are you come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me."
9,17,9,"If he is able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall you be our servants, and serve us."
9,17,10,"And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together."
9,17,11,"When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid."
9,17,12,"Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men, an old man in the days of Saul."
9,17,13,"And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah."
9,17,14,"And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul."
9,17,15,"But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem."
9,17,16,"And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days."
9,17,17,"And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for your brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to your brethren;"
9,17,18,"And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how your brethren fare, and bring back a token."
9,17,19,"Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines."
9,17,20,"And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the camp, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle."
9,17,21,"For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army."
9,17,22,"And David left his things in the hand of the keeper of supplies, and ran into the army, and came and greeted his brothers."
9,17,23,"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them."
9,17,24,"And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were greatly afraid."
9,17,25,"And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man that has come up? surely to defy Israel has he come up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel."
9,17,26,"And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
9,17,27,"And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that kills him."
9,17,28,"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why came you down here? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the insolence of your heart; for you are come down that you might see the battle."
9,17,29,"And David said, What have I now done? Is it not a word?"
9,17,30,"And he turned from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner."
9,17,31,"And when the words were heard which David spoke, they repeated them before Saul: and he sent for him."
9,17,32,"And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
9,17,33,"And Saul said to David, you are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."
9,17,34,"And David said unto Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:"
9,17,35,"And I went out after him, and struck him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and struck him, and slew him."
9,17,36,"Your servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God."
9,17,37,"David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with you."
9,17,38,"And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put a helmet of bronze upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail."
9,17,39,"And David girded his sword upon his armor, and he attempted to go; for he had not tried it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not tried them. And David put them off him."
9,17,40,"And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a pouch; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine."
9,17,41,"And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bore the shield went before him."
9,17,42,"And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he despised him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance."
9,17,43,"And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods."
9,17,44,"And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field."
9,17,45,"Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied."
9,17,46,"This day will the LORD deliver you into my hand; and I will strike you, and take your head from you; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel."
9,17,47,"And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands."
9,17,48,"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine."
9,17,49,"And David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth."
9,17,50,"So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David."
9,17,51,"Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head there. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled."
9,17,52,"And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron."
9,17,53,"And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their tents."
9,17,54,"And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent."
9,17,55,"And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the commander of the army, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell."
9,17,56,"And the king said, Inquire whose son the stripling is."
9,17,57,"And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand."
9,17,58,"And Saul said to him, Whose son are you, young man? And David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite."
9,18,1,"And it came to pass, when he had finished speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul."
9,18,2,"And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house."
9,18,3,"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul."
9,18,4,"And Jonathan removed the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his belt."
9,18,5,"And David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants."
9,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels, with joy, and with instruments of music."
9,18,7,"And the women sang to one another as they played, and said, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands."
9,18,8,"And Saul was very angry, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?"
9,18,9,"And Saul eyed David from that day forward."
9,18,10,"And it came to pass the next day, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand."
9,18,11,"And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will pin David even to the wall with it. And David escaped out of his presence twice."
9,18,12,"And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul."
9,18,13,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people."
9,18,14,"And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him."
9,18,15,"Therefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him."
9,18,16,"But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them."
9,18,17,"And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you as your wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD'S battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him."
9,18,18,"And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"
9,18,19,"But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite as his wife."
9,18,20,"And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him."
9,18,21,"And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David a second time, you shall this day be my son-in-law."
9,18,22,"And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Talk with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you: now therefore be the king's son-in-law."
9,18,23,"And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Does it seem to you a light thing to be a king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?"
9,18,24,"And the servants of Saul told him, saying, In this manner spoke David."
9,18,25,"And Saul said, Thus shall you say to David, The king desires not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines."
9,18,26,"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law: and the appointed days were not expired."
9,18,27,"Therefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter as his wife."
9,18,28,"And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him."
9,18,29,"And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually."
9,18,30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much esteemed."
9,19,1,"And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David."
9,19,2,"But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you: now therefore, I pray you, take heed to yourself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide yourself:"
9,19,3,"And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will talk with my father of you; and what I see, that I will tell you."
9,19,4,"And Jonathan spoke good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been toward you very good:"
9,19,5,"For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel: you saw it, and did rejoice: therefore then will you sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?"
9,19,6,"And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, As the LORD lives, he shall not be slain."
9,19,7,"And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past."
9,19,8,"And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him."
9,19,9,"And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand."
9,19,10,"And Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he drove the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night."
9,19,11,"Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If you save not your life tonight, tomorrow you shall be slain."
9,19,12,"So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped."
9,19,13,"And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his head, and covered it with a cloth."
9,19,14,"And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick."
9,19,15,"And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him."
9,19,16,"And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his head."
9,19,17,"And Saul said unto Michal, Why have you deceived me so, and sent away my enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill you?"
9,19,18,"So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth."
9,19,19,"And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,20,"And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied."
9,19,21,"And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also."
9,19,22,"Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Secu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,23,"And he went there to Naioth in Ramah: and the spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,24,"And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?"
9,20,1,"And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is my iniquity? and what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?"
9,20,2,"And he said unto him, God forbid; you shall not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it to me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so."
9,20,3,"And David swore again, and said, Your father certainly knows that I have found grace in your eyes; and he says, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death."
9,20,4,"Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever your soul desires, I will even do it for you."
9,20,5,"And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king to eat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at evening."
9,20,6,"If your father at all misses me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family."
9,20,7,"If he say thus, It is well; your servant shall have peace: but if he is very angry, then be sure that evil is determined by him."
9,20,8,"Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you: nevertheless, if there be in me iniquity, slay me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?"
9,20,9,"And Jonathan said, Far be it from you: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon you, then would not I tell it to you?"
9,20,10,"Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if your father answers you roughly?"
9,20,11,"And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field."
9,20,12,"And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded out my father tomorrow about this time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto you, and show it to you;"
9,20,13,"The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it pleases my father to do you evil, then I will show it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father."
9,20,14,"And you shall not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:"
9,20,15,"But also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever: no, not when the LORD has cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth."
9,20,16,"So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies."
9,20,17,"And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul."
9,20,18,"Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the new moon: and you shall be missed, because your seat will be empty."
9,20,19,"And when you have stayed three days, then you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the matter was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel."
9,20,20,"And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark."
9,20,21,"And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you, take them; then come you: for there is peace to you, and no hurt; as the LORD lives."
9,20,22,"But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way: for the LORD has sent you away."
9,20,23,"And as for the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between you and me forever."
9,20,24,"So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat himself down to eat the feast."
9,20,25,"And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty."
9,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean."
9,20,27,"And it came to pass the next day, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Why does not the son of Jesse come to the table, neither yesterday, nor today?"
9,20,28,"And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:"
9,20,29,"And he said, Let me go, I pray you; for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brethren. Therefore he comes not unto the king's table."
9,20,30,"Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, You son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and unto the shame of your mother's nakedness?"
9,20,31,"For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the ground, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Therefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die."
9,20,32,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Why shall he be slain? what has he done?"
9,20,33,"And Saul cast a javelin at him to strike him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David."
9,20,34,"So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had caused him shame."
9,20,35,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him."
9,20,36,"And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him."
9,20,37,"And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond you?"
9,20,38,"And Jonathan called after the lad, Make haste, hurry, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master."
9,20,39,"But the lad knew not anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter."
9,20,40,"And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city."
9,20,41,"And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David regained control."
9,20,42,"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, since as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city."
9,21,1,"Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?"
9,21,2,"And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king has charged me with a business, and has said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you: and I have directed my young men to such and such a place."
9,21,3,"Now therefore what is there on hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or what there is present."
9,21,4,"And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread on hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women."
9,21,5,"And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us for these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel."
9,21,6,"So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken away from before the LORD, to put hot bread in its place the day when it was taken away."
9,21,7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of the herdsmen that belonged to Saul."
9,21,8,"And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here on hand a spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste."
9,21,9,"And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it: for there is no other except that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it to me."
9,21,10,"And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath."
9,21,11,"And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?"
9,21,12,"And David laid up these words in his heart, and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath."
9,21,13,"And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and made marks on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard."
9,21,14,"Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, you see the man is mad: why then have you brought him to me?"
9,21,15,"Have I need of mad men, that you have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?"
9,22,1,"David therefore departed from there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him."
9,22,2,"And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men."
9,22,3,"And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray you, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me."
9,22,4,"And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold."
9,22,5,"And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and get you into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth."
9,22,6,"When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)"
9,22,7,"Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;"
9,22,8,"That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that shows me that my son has made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or shows unto me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
9,22,9,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub."
9,22,10,"And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
9,22,11,"Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king."
9,22,12,"And Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord."
9,22,13,"And Saul said unto him, Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"
9,22,14,"Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all your servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and goes at your bidding, and is honorable in your house?"
9,22,15,"Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for your servant knew nothing of all this, less or more."
9,22,16,"And the king said, you shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father's house."
9,22,17,"And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD."
9,22,18,"And the king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod."
9,22,19,"And Nob, the city of the priests, struck he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing infants, and oxen, and donkeys, and sheep, with the edge of the sword."
9,22,20,"And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David."
9,22,21,"And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests."
9,22,22,"And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have caused the death of all the persons of your father's house."
9,22,23,"Abide you with me, fear not: for he that seeks my life seeks your life: but with me you shall be safe."
9,23,1,"Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing floors.."
9,23,2,"Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and strike these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David,"
9,23,3,"And David's men said unto him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?"
9,23,4,"Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said,"
9,23,5,"So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and struck them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah."
9,23,6,"And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand."
9,23,7,"And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars."
9,23,8,"And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men."
9,23,9,"And David knew that Saul secretly plotted evil against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod."
9,23,10,"Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake."
9,23,11,"Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech you, tell your servant. And the LORD said,"
9,23,12,"Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said,"
9,23,13,"Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he decided not to go there."
9,23,14,"And David abode in the wilderness in strongholds, and remained in the mountains in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand."
9,23,15,"And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a forest."
9,23,16,"And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the forest, and strengthened his hand in God."
9,23,17,"And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto you; and that also Saul my father knows."
9,23,18,"And they both made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the forest, and Jonathan went to his house."
9,23,19,"Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in strongholds in the forest, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?"
9,23,20,"Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand."
9,23,21,"And Saul said, Blessed be you of the LORD; for you have compassion on me."
9,23,22,"Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see the place where his hideout is, and who has seen him there: for it is told me that he deals very craftily."
9,23,23,"See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come you again to me with certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah."
9,23,24,"And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon."
9,23,25,"Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David: therefore he came down to a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon."
9,23,26,"And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men surrounded David and his men to take them."
9,23,27,"But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste you, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land."
9,23,28,"Therefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth."
9,23,29,"And David went up from there, and dwelt in strongholds at Engedi."
9,24,1,"And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi."
9,24,2,"Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats."
9,24,3,"And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself: and David and his men remained in the recesses of the cave."
9,24,4,"And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it shall seem good unto you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe stealthily."
9,24,5,"And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart troubled him, because he had cut off Saul's robe."
9,24,6,"And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD."
9,24,7,"So David restrained his servants with these words, and allowed them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way."
9,24,8,"David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself."
9,24,9,"And David said to Saul, Why hear you men's words, saying, Behold, David seeks your hurt?"
9,24,10,"Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered you today into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill you: but my eye spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is the LORD'S anointed."
9,24,11,"Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of your robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and killed you not, know you and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you; yet you hunt my soul to take it."
9,24,12,"The LORD judge between me and you, and the LORD avenge me of you: but my hand shall not be upon you."
9,24,13,"As says the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked: but my hand shall not be upon you."
9,24,14,"After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea."
9,24,15,"The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand."
9,24,16,"And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept."
9,24,17,"And he said to David, you are more righteous than I: for you have rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded you with evil."
9,24,18,"And you have shown this day how that you have dealt well with me: for when the LORD had delivered me into your hand, you killed me not."
9,24,19,"For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safe? therefore the LORD reward you with good for what you have done unto me this day."
9,24,20,"And now, behold, I know well that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand."
9,24,21,"Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that you will not cut off my descendants after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house."
9,24,22,"And David swore unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men got themselves up unto the stronghold."
9,25,1,"And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented over him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran."
9,25,2,"And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel."
9,25,3,"Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was surly and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb."
9,25,4,"And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep."
9,25,5,"And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:"
9,25,6,"And thus shall you say to him that lives in prosperity, Peace be both to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be unto all that you have."
9,25,7,"And now I have heard that you have shearers: now your shepherds which were with us, we hurt not, neither was there anything missing from them, all the while they were in Carmel."
9,25,8,"Ask your young men, and they will show you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes: for we come on a feast day: give, I pray you, whatsoever comes to your hand unto your servants, and to your son David."
9,25,9,"And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased."
9,25,10,"And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants now days that break away each man from his master."
9,25,11,"Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not from where they be?"
9,25,12,"So David's young men turned away, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings."
9,25,13,"And David said unto his men, Gird you on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the supplies."
9,25,14,"But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master; and he railed at them."
9,25,15,"But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:"
9,25,16,"They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep."
9,25,17,"Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him."
9,25,18,"Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two skins of wine, and five sheep already dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys."
9,25,19,"And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal."
9,25,20,"And it was so, as she rode on the donkey, that she came down under cover of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them."
9,25,21,"Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he has repaid me evil for good."
9,25,22,"God do so and more also unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that belong to him by the morning light even one male."
9,25,23,"And when Abigail saw David, she hastened, and got off the donkey, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,"
9,25,24,"And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let your handmaid, I pray you, speak in your audience, and hear the words of your handmaid."
9,25,25,"Let not my lord, I pray you, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I your handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom you did send."
9,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, seeing the LORD has held you back from coming to shed blood, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now let your enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal."
9,25,27,"And now this blessing which your handmaid has brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord."
9,25,28,"I pray you, forgive the trespass of your handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord an enduring house; because my lord fights the battles of the LORD, and evil has not been found in you all your days."
9,25,29,"Yet a man has risen to pursue you, and to seek your soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with the LORD your God; and the souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling."
9,25,30,"And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you ruler over Israel;"
9,25,31,"That this shall be no grief unto you, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid."
9,25,32,"And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me:"
9,25,33,"And blessed be your advice, and blessed be you, who has kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with my own hand."
9,25,34,"For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel lives, who has kept me back from hurting you, unless you had hastened and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any remaining males."
9,25,35,"So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to your house; see, I have hearkened to your voice, and have accepted your person."
9,25,36,"And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk: therefore she told him nothing, little or much, until the morning light."
9,25,37,"But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone."
9,25,38,"And it came to pass about ten days later, that the LORD struck Nabal, that he died."
9,25,39,"And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept his servant from evil: for the LORD has returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and talked with Abigail, to take her to be his wife."
9,25,40,"And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke unto her, saying, David sent us unto you, to take you to be his wife."
9,25,41,"And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let your handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord."
9,25,42,"And Abigail hastened, and arose, and rode upon a donkey, with five of her young women that attended her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife."
9,25,43,"David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives."
9,25,44,"But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim."
9,26,1,"And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon?"
9,26,2,"Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph."
9,26,3,"And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon, by the road. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness."
9,26,4,"David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come indeed."
9,26,5,"And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army: and Saul lay within the camp, and the people encamped round about him."
9,26,6,"Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with you."
9,26,7,"So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the camp, and his spear stuck in the ground at his head: but Abner and the people lay round about him."
9,26,8,"Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day: now therefore let me strike him, I pray you, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not strike him the second time."
9,26,9,"And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed, and be guiltless?"
9,26,10,"David said furthermore, As the LORD lives, the LORD shall strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish."
9,26,11,"The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed: but, I pray you, take you now the spear that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let us go."
9,26,12,"So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head; and they got away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awoke: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them."
9,26,13,"Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off; a great space being between them:"
9,26,14,"And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answer you not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you that cry to the king?"
9,26,15,"And David said to Abner, are not you a valiant man? and who is like to you in Israel? why then have you not kept your lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king your lord."
9,26,16,"This thing is not good that you have done. As the LORD lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept your master, the LORD'S anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head."
9,26,17,"And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this your voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king."
9,26,18,"And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?"
9,26,19,"Now therefore, I pray you, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods."
9,26,20,"Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge in the mountains."
9,26,21,"Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do you harm, because my soul was precious in your eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly."
9,26,22,"And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and get it."
9,26,23,"The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered you into my hand today, but I would not stretch forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed."
9,26,24,"And, behold, as your life was precious this day in my eyes, so let my life be precious in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation."
9,26,25,"Then Saul said to David, Blessed be you, my son David: you shall both do great things, and also shall still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place."
9,27,1,"And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any border of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand."
9,27,2,"And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath."
9,27,3,"And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's widow."
9,27,4,"And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him."
9,27,5,"And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in your eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?"
9,27,6,"Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: therefore Ziklag has belonged unto the kings of Judah unto this day."
9,27,7,"And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months."
9,27,8,"And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gizites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt."
9,27,9,"And David struck the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish."
9,27,10,"And Achish said, where have you made a raid today? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites."
9,27,11,"And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his custom all the while he dwells in the country of the Philistines."
9,27,12,"And Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant forever."
9,28,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know you assuredly, that you shall go out with me to battle, you and your men."
9,28,2,"And David said to Achish, Surely you shall know what your servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make you my guardian forever."
9,28,3,"Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away the mediums, and the wizards, out of the land."
9,28,4,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa."
9,28,5,"And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled."
9,28,6,"And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets."
9,28,7,"Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that is a medium at Endor."
9,28,8,"And Saul disguised himself, and put on other clothing, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray you, divine unto me as a medium, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto you."
9,28,9,"And the woman said unto him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those that are mediums, and the wizards, out of the land: why then lay you a snare for my life, to cause me to die?"
9,28,10,"And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD lives, there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing."
9,28,11,"Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto you? And he said, Bring me up Samuel."
9,28,12,"And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? for you are Saul."
9,28,13,"And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what saw you? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw a god ascending out of the earth."
9,28,14,"And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself."
9,28,15,"And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am much distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you may make known unto me what I shall do."
9,28,16,"Then said Samuel, Why then do you ask of me, seeing the LORD has departed from you, and has become your enemy?"
9,28,17,"And the LORD has done to you, as he spoke by me: for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David:"
9,28,18,"Because you obeyed not the voice of the LORD, nor executed his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore has the LORD done this thing unto you this day."
9,28,19,"Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines: and tomorrow shall you and your sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines."
9,28,20,"Then Saul fell immediately full length on the ground, and was very much afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no food all the day, nor all the night."
9,28,21,"And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was greatly troubled, and said unto him, Behold, your handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto your words which you spoke unto me."
9,28,22,"Now therefore, I pray you, hearken also unto the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a piece of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way."
9,28,23,"But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed."
9,28,24,"And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she hastened, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread of it:"
9,28,25,"And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night."
9,29,1,"Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by a fountain which is in Jezreel."
9,29,2,"And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish."
9,29,3,"Then said the princes of the Philistines, What are these Hebrews doing here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he deserted unto me unto this day?"
9,29,4,"And the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for with what should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?"
9,29,5,"Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?"
9,29,6,"Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favor you not."
9,29,7,"Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you displease not the lords of the Philistines."
9,29,8,"And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what have you found in your servant so long as I have been with you unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
9,29,9,"And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle."
9,29,10,"Therefore now rise up early in the morning with your master's servants that are come with you: and as soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart."
9,29,11,"So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel."
9,30,1,"And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;"
9,30,2,"And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way."
9,30,3,"So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives."
9,30,4,"Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep."
9,30,5,"And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite."
9,30,6,"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God."
9,30,7,"And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought there the ephod to David."
9,30,8,"And David inquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him,"
9,30,9,"So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed."
9,30,10,"But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor."
9,30,11,"And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;"
9,30,12,"And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights."
9,30,13,"And David said unto him, To whom do you belong? and from where are you? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick."
9,30,14,"We made an invasion upon the south area of the Cherethites, and upon the territory which belongs to Judah, and upon the south area of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire."
9,30,15,"And David said to him, Can you bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this company."
9,30,16,"And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah."
9,30,17,"And David struck them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, except four hundred young men, who rode upon camels, and fled."
9,30,18,"And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives."
9,30,19,"And there was nothing lacking of them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered it all."
9,30,20,"And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil."
9,30,21,"And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them."
9,30,22,"Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart."
9,30,23,"Then said David, you shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD has given us, who has preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand."
9,30,24,"For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goes down to the battle, so shall his part be that waits by the supplies: they shall part alike."
9,30,25,"And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day."
9,30,26,"And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;"
9,30,27,"To them who were in Bethel, and to them who were in south Ramoth, and to them who were in Jattir,"
9,30,28,"And to them who were in Aroer, and to them who were in Siphmoth, and to them who were in Eshtemoa,"
9,30,29,"And to them who were in Racal, and to them who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them who were in the cities of the Kenites,"
9,30,30,"And to them who were in Hormah, and to them who were in Borashan, and to them who were in Athach,"
9,30,31,"And to them who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to roam."
9,31,1,"Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa."
9,31,2,"And the Philistines followed close upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's sons."
9,31,3,"And the battle went hard against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was severely wounded of the archers."
9,31,4,"Then said Saul unto his armorbearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it."
9,31,5,"And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him."
9,31,6,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armorbearer, and all his men, that same day together."
9,31,7,"And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side of Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them."
9,31,8,"And it came to pass the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa."
9,31,9,"And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to proclaim it in the house of their idols, and among the people."
9,31,10,"And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan."
9,31,11,"And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;"
9,31,12,"All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there."
9,31,13,"And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days."
10,1,1,"Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;"
10,1,2,"It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes torn, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and paid him honor."
10,1,3,"And David said unto him, From where come you? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped."
10,1,4,"And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray you, tell me. And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also."
10,1,5,"And David said unto the young man that told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?"
10,1,6,"And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him."
10,1,7,"And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I."
10,1,8,"And he said unto me, Who are you? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite."
10,1,9,"He said unto me again, Stand, I pray you, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me."
10,1,10,"So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here unto my lord."
10,1,11,"Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men that were with him:"
10,1,12,"And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword."
10,1,13,"And David said unto the young man that told him, From where are you? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite."
10,1,14,"And David said unto him, How were you not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy the LORDâ€™S anointed?"
10,1,15,"And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he struck him so that he died."
10,1,16,"And David said unto him, Your blood be upon your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain the LORDâ€™S anointed."
10,1,17,"And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:"
10,1,18,"Also he told them to teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher."
10,1,19,"The beauty of Israel is slain upon your high places: how are the mighty fallen!"
10,1,20,"Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph."
10,1,21,"You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil."
10,1,22,"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty."
10,1,23,"Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions."
10,1,24,"You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel."
10,1,25,"How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, you were slain in your high places."
10,1,26,"I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant have you been unto me: your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women."
10,1,27,"How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"
10,2,1,"And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him,"
10,2,2,"So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabalâ€™s widow the Carmelite."
10,2,3,"And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron."
10,2,4,"And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul."
10,2,5,"And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said unto them, Blessed be you of the LORD, that you have shown this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him."
10,2,6,"And now the LORD show kindness and truth unto you: and I also will repay you this kindness, because you have done this thing."
10,2,7,"Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be you valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."
10,2,8,"But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saulâ€™s army, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;"
10,2,9,"And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel."
10,2,10,"Ish-bosheth Saulâ€™s son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David."
10,2,11,"And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months."
10,2,12,"And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon."
10,2,13,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool."
10,2,14,"And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise."
10,2,15,"Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David."
10,2,16,"And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellowâ€™s side; so they fell down together: therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon."
10,2,17,"And there was a very fierce battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David."
10,2,18,"And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe."
10,2,19,"And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner."
10,2,20,"Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Are you Asahel? And he answered, I am."
10,2,21,"And Abner said to him, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay you hold on one of the young men, and take you his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him."
10,2,22,"And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me: why should I strike you to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?"
10,2,23,"However he refused to turn aside: therefore Abner with the blunt end of the spear struck him under the fifth rib, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still."
10,2,24,"Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon."
10,2,25,"And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill."
10,2,26,"Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour forever? know you not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, before you bid the people return from following their brethren?"
10,2,27,"And Joab said, As God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone up every one from following his brother."
10,2,28,"So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more."
10,2,29,"And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim."
10,2,30,"And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of Davidâ€™s servants nineteen men and Asahel."
10,2,31,"But the servants of David had struck down Benjamin, and Abnerâ€™s men, so that three hundred and threescore men died."
10,2,32,"And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulcher of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day."
10,3,1,"Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker."
10,3,2,"And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;"
10,3,3,"And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;"
10,3,4,"And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;"
10,3,5,"And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah Davidâ€™s wife. These were born to David in Hebron."
10,3,6,"And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul."
10,3,7,"And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in unto my fatherâ€™s concubine?"
10,3,8,"Then was Abner very angry because of the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dogâ€™s head, which against Judah does show kindness this day unto the house of Saul your father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David, that you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman?"
10,3,9,"So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD has sworn to David, even so I do to him;"
10,3,10,"To transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba."
10,3,11,"And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him."
10,3,12,"And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel unto you."
10,3,13,"And he said, Well; I will make a league with you: but one thing I require of you, that is, You shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal Saulâ€™s daughter, when you come to see my face."
10,3,14,"And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saulâ€™s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
10,3,15,"And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish."
10,3,16,"And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned."
10,3,17,"And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, You sought for David in times past to be king over you:"
10,3,18,"Now then do it: for the LORD has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies."
10,3,19,"And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin."
10,3,20,"So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast."
10,3,21,"And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace."
10,3,22,"And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace."
10,3,23,"When Joab and all the host that were with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace."
10,3,24,"Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold, Abner came unto you; why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?"
10,3,25,"You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do."
10,3,26,"And when Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not."
10,3,27,"And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there under the fifth rib, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother."
10,3,28,"And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD forever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:"
10,3,29,"Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his fatherâ€™s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls on the sword, or that lacks bread."
10,3,30,"So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle."
10,3,31,"And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Tear your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the coffin."
10,3,32,"And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept."
10,3,33,"And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dies?"
10,3,34,"Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters: as a man falls before wicked men, so fell you. And all the people wept again over him."
10,3,35,"And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, till the sun be down."
10,3,36,"And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people."
10,3,37,"For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner."
10,3,38,"And the king said unto his servants, Know you not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?"
10,3,39,"And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness."
10,4,1,"And when Saulâ€™s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled."
10,4,2,"And Saulâ€™s son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:"
10,4,3,"And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)"
10,4,4,"And Jonathan, Saulâ€™s son, had a son that was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth."
10,4,5,"And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who lay on a bed at noon."
10,4,6,"And they came there into the midst of the house, as though they would have gotten wheat; and they struck him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped."
10,4,7,"For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they struck him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and got themselves away through the plain all night."
10,4,8,"And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life; and the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his descendants"
10,4,9,"And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,"
10,4,10,"When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:"
10,4,11,"How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?"
10,4,12,"And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the sepulcher of Abner in Hebron."
10,5,1,"Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh."
10,5,2,"Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD said to you,"
10,5,3,"So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel."
10,5,4,"David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years."
10,5,5,"In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah."
10,5,6,"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: who spoke unto David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here: thinking, David cannot come in here."
10,5,7,"Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion: the same is the city of David."
10,5,8,"And David said on that day, Whosoever gets up the water shaft, and strikes the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of Davidâ€™s soul, he shall be chief and captain. Therefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house."
10,5,9,"So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built all around from Millo inward."
10,5,10,"And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him."
10,5,11,"And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David a house."
10,5,12,"And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israelâ€™s sake."
10,5,13,"And David took himself more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David."
10,5,14,"And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,"
10,5,15,"Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,"
10,5,16,"And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet."
10,5,17,"But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold."
10,5,18,"The Philistines also came and spread out in the valley of Rephaim."
10,5,19,"And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? will you deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said unto David,"
10,5,20,"And David came to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there, and said, The LORD has broken forth upon my enemies before me, as the breakthrough of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim."
10,5,21,"And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them."
10,5,22,"And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread out in the valley of Rephaim."
10,5,23,"And when David inquired of the LORD, he said,"
10,5,24,""
10,5,25,"And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer."
10,6,1,"Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand."
10,6,2,"And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts who dwells between the cherubim."
10,6,3,"And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart."
10,6,4,"And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark."
10,6,5,"And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on tambourines, and on castanets, and on cymbals."
10,6,6,"And when they came to Naconâ€™s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it."
10,6,7,"And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah; and God struck him there for his irreverence; and there he died by the ark of God."
10,6,8,"And David was angry, because the LORD had made an outbreak against Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day."
10,6,9,"And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?"
10,6,10,"So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite."
10,6,11,"And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obed-edom, and all his household."
10,6,12,"And it was told king David, saying, The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertains unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness."
10,6,13,"And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings."
10,6,14,"And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was wearing a linen ephod."
10,6,15,"So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet."
10,6,16,"And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saulâ€™s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart."
10,6,17,"And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD."
10,6,18,"And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts."
10,6,19,"And he distributed among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to the women and to the men, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house."
10,6,20,"Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the base fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!"
10,6,21,"And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, who chose me before your father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I make merry before the LORD."
10,6,22,"And I will yet be more contemptible than this, and will be abased in my own sight: and of the maidservants whom you have spoken, of them shall I be held in honor."
10,6,23,"Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death."
10,7,1,"And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest all around from all his enemies;"
10,7,2,"That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains."
10,7,3,"And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart; for the LORD is with you."
10,7,4,"And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,"
10,7,5,""
10,7,6,""
10,7,7,""
10,7,8,""
10,7,9,""
10,7,10,""

10,7,13,""
10,7,14,""
10,7,15,""
10,7,16,""
10,7,17,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David."
10,7,18,"Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?"
10,7,19,"And this was yet a small thing in your sight, O Lord GOD; but you have spoken also of your servantâ€™s house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?"
10,7,20,"And what can David say more unto you? for you, Lord GOD, know your servant."
10,7,21,"For your wordâ€™s sake, and according to your own heart, have you done all these great things, to make your servant know them."
10,7,22,"Therefore you are great, O LORD God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
10,7,23,"And what one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make himself a name, and to do for you great things and awesome, for your land, before your people, whom you redeemed to yourself from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?"
10,7,24,"For you have confirmed to yourself your people Israel to be a people unto you forever: and you, LORD, have become their God."
10,7,25,"And now, O LORD God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, establish it forever, and do as you have said."
10,7,26,"And let your name be magnified forever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of your servant David be established before you."
10,7,27,"For you, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying,"
10,7,28,"And now, O Lord GOD, you are that God, and your words are true, and you have promised this goodness unto your servant:"
10,7,29,"Therefore now let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you: for you, O Lord GOD, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your servant be blessed forever."
10,8,1,"And after this it came to pass, that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines."
10,8,2,"And he struck Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he the ones to put to death, and with one full line the ones to keep alive. And so the Moabites became Davidâ€™s servants, and brought gifts."
10,8,3,"David struck also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his territory at the river Euphrates."
10,8,4,"And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots."
10,8,5,"And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men."
10,8,6,"Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went."
10,8,7,"And David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
10,8,8,"And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took very much bronze."
10,8,9,"When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the armies of Hadadezer,"
10,8,10,"Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and defeated him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of bronze:"
10,8,11,"Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;"
10,8,12,"Of Edom, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah."
10,8,13,"And David got him a name when he returned from defeating of the Edomites in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men."
10,8,14,"And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became Davidâ€™s servants. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went."
10,8,15,"And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people."
10,8,16,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;"
10,8,17,"And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;"
10,8,18,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and Davidâ€™s sons were chief rulers."
10,9,1,"And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathanâ€™s sake?"
10,9,2,"And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Are you Ziba? And he said, Your servant is he."
10,9,3,"And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame on his feet."
10,9,4,"And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar."
10,9,5,"Then king David sent, and brought him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar."
10,9,6,"Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold your servant!"
10,9,7,"And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your fatherâ€™s sake, and will restore you all the land of Saul your father; and you shall eat bread at my table continually."
10,9,8,"And he bowed himself, and said, What is your servant, that you should look upon such a dead dog as I am?"
10,9,9,"Then the king called to Ziba, Saulâ€™s servant, and said unto him, I have given unto your masterâ€™s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house."
10,9,10,"You therefore, and your sons, and your servants, shall till the land for him, and you shall bring in the fruits, that your masterâ€™s son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth your masterâ€™s son shall eat bread always at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants."
10,9,11,"Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so shall your servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the kingâ€™s sons."
10,9,12,"And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth."
10,9,13,"So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the kingâ€™s table; and was lame in both his feet."
10,10,1,"And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead."
10,10,2,"Then said David, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And Davidâ€™s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon."
10,10,3,"And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Think you that David does honor your father, that he has sent comforters unto you? Has not David rather sent his servants unto you, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?"
10,10,4,"Therefore Hanun took Davidâ€™s servants, and shaved off one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away."
10,10,5,"When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards are grown, and then return."
10,10,6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they had become repulsive before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ish-tob twelve thousand men."
10,10,7,"And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men."
10,10,8,"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ish-tob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field."
10,10,9,"When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both before and behind, he chose some of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:"
10,10,10,"And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon."
10,10,11,"And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you, then I will come and help you."
10,10,12,"Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seems to him good."
10,10,13,"And Joab drew near, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him."
10,10,14,"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then they also fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem."
10,10,15,"And when the Syrians saw that they were defeated before Israel, they gathered themselves together."
10,10,16,"And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the army of Hadarezer went before them."
10,10,17,"And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him."
10,10,18,"And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army, who died there."
10,10,19,"And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more."
10,11,1,"And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem."
10,11,2,"And it came to pass in an evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the kingâ€™s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon."
10,11,3,"And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
10,11,4,"And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house."
10,11,5,"And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child."
10,11,6,"And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David."
10,11,7,"And when Uriah was come unto him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered."
10,11,8,"And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet. And Uriah departed out of the kingâ€™s house, and there followed him a present from the king."
10,11,9,"But Uriah slept at the door of the kingâ€™s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house."
10,11,10,"And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Came you not from your journey? why then did you not go down unto your house?"
10,11,11,"And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing."
10,11,12,"And David said to Uriah, Tarry here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow."
10,11,13,"And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house."
10,11,14,"And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah."
10,11,15,"And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire from him, that he may be struck down, and die."
10,11,16,"And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were."
10,11,17,"And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also."
10,11,18,"Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;"
10,11,19,"And charged the messenger, saying, When you have finished telling the matters of the war unto the king,"
10,11,20,"And if so be that the kingâ€™s anger arises, and he says unto you, Why approached you so near unto the city when you did fight? knew you not that they would shoot from the wall?"
10,11,21,"Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went you near the wall? then say, Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
10,11,22,"So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent him for."
10,11,23,"And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entrance of the gate."
10,11,24,"And the shooters shot from off the wall upon your servants; and some of the kingâ€™s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
10,11,25,"Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shall you say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another: make your battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and so encourage him."
10,11,26,"And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband."
10,11,27,"And when the mourning was past, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD."
10,12,1,"And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor."
10,12,2,"The rich man had a great many flocks and herds:"
10,12,3,"But the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own food, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter."
10,12,4,"And there came a traveler unto the rich man, and he refused to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to prepare for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor manâ€™s lamb, and prepared it for the man that was come to him."
10,12,5,"And Davidâ€™s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD lives, the man that has done this thing shall surely die:"
10,12,6,"And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity."
10,12,7,"And Nathan said to David, You are the man. Thus says the LORD God of Israel,"
10,12,8,""
10,12,9,""
10,12,10,""
10,12,11,"Thus says the LORD,"
10,12,12,""
10,12,13,"And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die."
10,12,14,"However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto you shall surely die."
10,12,15,"And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriahâ€™s wife bore unto David, and it was very sick."
10,12,16,"David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth."
10,12,17,"And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them."
10,12,18,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?"
10,12,19,"But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead."
10,12,20,"Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshiped: then he came to his own house; and when he asked, they set food before him, and he did eat."
10,12,21,"Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that you have done? you did fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, you did rise and eat bread."
10,12,22,"And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?"
10,12,23,"But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me."
10,12,24,"And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him."
10,12,25,"And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD."
10,12,26,"And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city."
10,12,27,"And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters."
10,12,28,"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name."
10,12,29,"And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it."
10,12,30,"And he took their kingâ€™s crown from off his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on Davidâ€™s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance."
10,12,31,"And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them to work with saws, and with picks of iron, and with axes of iron, and made them toil at the brick kilns: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem."
10,13,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her."
10,13,2,"And Amnon was so distressed, that he became sick over his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it improper for him to do anything to her."
10,13,3,"But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah Davidâ€™s brother: and Jonadab was a very subtle man."
10,13,4,"And he said unto him, Why are you, being the kingâ€™s son, so haggard from day to day? will you not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalomâ€™s sister."
10,13,5,"And Jonadab said unto him, Lay you down on your bed, and pretend to be sick: and when your father comes to see you, say unto him, I pray you, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand."
10,13,6,"So Amnon lay down, and pretended to be sick: and when the king had come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray you, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand."
10,13,7,"Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnonâ€™s house, and prepare him food."
10,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnonâ€™s house; and he was lying down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes."
10,13,9,"And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Send out all men from me. And they went out every man from him."
10,13,10,"And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat of your hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother."
10,13,11,"And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister."
10,13,12,"And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not you this folly."
10,13,13,"And I, where shall I cause my shame to go? and as for you, you shall be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from you."
10,13,14,"However he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her."
10,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone."
10,13,16,"And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that you did unto me. But he would not hearken unto her."
10,13,17,"Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her."
10,13,18,"And she had a garment of many colors upon her: for with such robes were the kingâ€™s daughters that were virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her."
10,13,19,"And Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of many colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying."
10,13,20,"And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon your brother been with you? but hold now your peace, my sister: he is your brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalomâ€™s house."
10,13,21,"But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry."
10,13,22,"And Absalom spoke unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar."
10,13,23,"And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the kingâ€™s sons."
10,13,24,"And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, your servant has sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech you, and his servants go with your servant."
10,13,25,"And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto you. And he pressed him: however he would not go, but blessed him."
10,13,26,"Then said Absalom, If not, I pray you, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with you?"
10,13,27,"But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the kingâ€™s sons go with him."
10,13,28,"Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now when Amnonâ€™s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Strike Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant."
10,13,29,"And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the kingâ€™s sons arose, and every man got him up upon his mule, and fled."
10,13,30,"And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the kingâ€™s sons, and there is not one of them left."
10,13,31,"Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn."
10,13,32,"And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah Davidâ€™s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the kingâ€™s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar."
10,13,33,"Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the kingâ€™s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead."
10,13,34,"But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came many people by the way of the hillside behind him."
10,13,35,"And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the kingâ€™s sons come: as your servant said, so it is."
10,13,36,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the kingâ€™s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly."
10,13,37,"But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day."
10,13,38,"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years."
10,13,39,"And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead."
10,14,1,"Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the kingâ€™s heart went out toward Absalom."
10,14,2,"And Joab sent to Tekoah, and brought from there a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray you, pretend to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not yourself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:"
10,14,3,"And come to the king, and speak in this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth."
10,14,4,"And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and pain him honor, and said, Help, O king."
10,14,5,"And the king said unto her, What ails you? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead."
10,14,6,"And your handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one struck the other, and slew him."
10,14,7,"And, behold, the whole family is risen against your handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that struck his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my ember which is left, and shall not leave to my husband either name or remnant upon the earth."
10,14,8,"And the king said unto the woman, Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you."
10,14,9,"And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my fatherâ€™s house: and the king and his throne be guiltless."
10,14,10,"And the king said, Whosoever says anything unto you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you any more."
10,14,11,"Then said she, I pray you, let the king remember the LORD your God, that you would not allow the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of your son fall to the earth."
10,14,12,"Then the woman said, Let your handmaid, I pray you, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on."
10,14,13,"And the woman said, Why then have you thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king does speak this thing as one who is faulty, in that the king does not bring home again his banished one."
10,14,14,"For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God respect any person: yet does he devise means, that his banished one be not expelled from him."
10,14,15,"Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid."
10,14,16,"For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God."
10,14,17,"Then your handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD your God will be with you."
10,14,18,"Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray you, the thing that I shall ask you. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak."
10,14,19,"And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman answered and said, As your soul lives, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken: for your servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid:"
10,14,20,"To bring about this change of affairs has your servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth."
10,14,21,"And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again."
10,14,22,"And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, Today your servant knows that I have found grace in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant."
10,14,23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem."
10,14,24,"And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the kingâ€™s face."
10,14,25,"But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him."
10,14,26,"And when he cut the hair of his head, (for it was at every yearâ€™s end that he cut it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he cut it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the kingâ€™s weight."
10,14,27,"And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance."
10,14,28,"So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the kingâ€™s face."
10,14,29,"Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come."
10,14,30,"Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joabâ€™s field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalomâ€™s servants set the field on fire."
10,14,31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?"
10,14,32,"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto you, saying, Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the kingâ€™s face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me."
10,14,33,"So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom."
10,15,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him."
10,15,2,"And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel."
10,15,3,"And Absalom said unto him, See, your matters are good and right; but there is no man appointed of the king to hear you."
10,15,4,"Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!"
10,15,5,"And it was so, that when any man came near to him to bow down to him, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him."
10,15,6,"And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel."
10,15,7,"And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray you, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron."
10,15,8,"For your servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Aram, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD."
10,15,9,"And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron."
10,15,10,"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron."
10,15,11,"And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went along innocently, and they knew not any thing."
10,15,12,"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, Davidâ€™s counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom."
10,15,13,"And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom."
10,15,14,"And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword."
10,15,15,"And the kingâ€™s servants said unto the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall command."
10,15,16,"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house."
10,15,17,"And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off."
10,15,18,"And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king."
10,15,19,"Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with us? return to your place, and abide with the king: for you are a stranger, and also an exile."
10,15,20,"You came only yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us? seeing I go where I may, return you, and take back your brethren: mercy and truth be with you."
10,15,21,"And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will your servant be."
10,15,22,"And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him."
10,15,23,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness."
10,15,24,"And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had all passed out of the city."
10,15,25,"And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:"
10,15,26,"But if he thus says, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seems good unto him."
10,15,27,"The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Are not you a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar."
10,15,28,"See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to inform me."
10,15,29,"Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there."
10,15,30,"And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up."
10,15,31,"And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness."
10,15,32,"And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshiped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and earth upon his head:"
10,15,33,"Unto whom David said, If you go on with me, then you shall be a burden unto me:"
10,15,34,"But if you return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your fatherâ€™s servant in time past, so will I now also be your servant: then you may for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel."
10,15,35,"And have you not there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that whatsoever thing you shall hear out of the kingâ€™s house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests."
10,15,36,"Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadokâ€™s son, and Jonathan Abiatharâ€™s son; and by them you shall send unto me everything that you can hear."
10,15,37,"So Hushai Davidâ€™s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem."
10,16,1,"And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine."
10,16,2,"And the king said unto Ziba, What mean you by these? And Ziba said, The donkeys are for the kingâ€™s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink."
10,16,3,"And the king said, And where is your masterâ€™s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father."
10,16,4,"Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, all that belonged unto Mephibosheth are yours. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech you that I may find grace in your sight, my lord, O king."
10,16,5,"And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed continually as he came."
10,16,6,"And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left."
10,16,7,"And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, you bloody man, and you man of Belial:"
10,16,8,"The LORD has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son: and, behold, you are taken in your mischief, because you are a bloody man."
10,16,9,"Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray you, and take off his head."
10,16,10,"And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD has said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why have you done so?"
10,16,11,"And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth of my own body, seeks my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD has bidden him."
10,16,12,"It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction, and that the LORD will repay me good for his cursing this day."
10,16,13,"And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hillâ€™s side opposite him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust."
10,16,14,"And the king, and all the people that were with him, became weary, and refreshed themselves there."
10,16,15,"And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him."
10,16,16,"And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, Davidâ€™s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king."
10,16,17,"And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? why went you not with your friend?"
10,16,18,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide."
10,16,19,"And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in your fatherâ€™s presence, so will I be in your presence."
10,16,20,"Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do."
10,16,21,"And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto your fatherâ€™s concubines, which he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that you are abhorred by your father: then shall the hands of all that are with you be strong."
10,16,22,"So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his fatherâ€™s concubines in the sight of all Israel."
10,16,23,"And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom."
10,17,1,"Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:"
10,17,2,"And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will strike the king only:"
10,17,3,"And I will bring back all the people unto you: only the man whom you seek will be struck: so all the people shall be in peace."
10,17,4,"And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel."
10,17,5,"Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says."
10,17,6,"And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke unto him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak you."
10,17,7,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time."
10,17,8,"For, said Hushai, you know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people."
10,17,9,"Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of the people fall at the first attack, that whosoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom."
10,17,10,"And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and they who are with him are valiant men."
10,17,11,"Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto you, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person."
10,17,12,"So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one."
10,17,13,"Moreover, if he has gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there."
10,17,14,"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had purposed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom."
10,17,15,"Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled."
10,17,16,"Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him."
10,17,17,"Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they dared not be seen to come into the city: and a maidservant went and told them; and they went and told king David."
10,17,18,"Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a manâ€™s house in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down into it."
10,17,19,"And the woman took and spread a covering over the wellâ€™s mouth, and spread ground grain thereon; and the thing was not known."
10,17,20,"And when Absalomâ€™s servants came to the woman at the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They are gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem."
10,17,21,"And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you."
10,17,22,"Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there was left not one of them that was not gone over Jordan."
10,17,23,"And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and got him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulcher of his father."
10,17,24,"Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him."
10,17,25,"And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a manâ€™s son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joabâ€™s mother."
10,17,26,"So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead."
10,17,27,"And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,"
10,17,28,"Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched grain, and beans, and lentils, and parched seed,"
10,17,29,"And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cows, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness."
10,18,1,"And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them."
10,18,2,"And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joabâ€™s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also."
10,18,3,"But the people answered, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now you are worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that you support us from out of the city."
10,18,4,"And the king said unto them, What seems to you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands."
10,18,5,"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains the charge concerning Absalom."
10,18,6,"So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim;"
10,18,7,"Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men."
10,18,8,"For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured."
10,18,9,"And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught fast in the oak, and he was left hanging between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away."
10,18,10,"And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak."
10,18,11,"And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, you saw him, and why did you not strike him there to the ground? and I would have given you ten shekels of silver, and a belt."
10,18,12,"And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the kingâ€™s son: for in our hearing the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom."
10,18,13,"Otherwise I should have dealt falsely against my own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me."
10,18,14,"Then said Joab, I cannot tarry thus with you. And he took three spears in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak."
10,18,15,"And ten young men that bore Joabâ€™s armor compassed about and struck Absalom, and slew him."
10,18,16,"And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people."
10,18,17,"And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent."
10,18,18,"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the kingâ€™s valley: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalomâ€™s pillar."
10,18,19,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD has avenged him of his enemies."
10,18,20,"And Joab said unto him, You shall not bear tidings this day, but you shall bear tidings another day: but this day you shall bear no tidings, because the kingâ€™s son is dead."
10,18,21,"Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what you have seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran."
10,18,22,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, Come what may, let me, I pray you, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why will you run, my son, seeing that you have no tidings ready?"
10,18,23,"Come what may, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran Cushi."
10,18,24,"And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone."
10,18,25,"And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he is alone, there are tidings in his mouth. And he came rapidly, and drew near."
10,18,26,"And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the gatekeeper, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings tidings."
10,18,27,"And the watchman said, I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good tidings."
10,18,28,"And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king."
10,18,29,"And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the kingâ€™s servant, and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was."
10,18,30,"And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still."
10,18,31,"And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD has avenged you this day of all them that rose up against you."
10,18,32,"And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against you to do you hurt, be as that young man is."
10,18,33,"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for you, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10,19,1,"And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom."
10,19,2,"And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son."
10,19,3,"And the people stole back that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle."
10,19,4,"But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!"
10,19,5,"And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;"
10,19,6,"In that you love your enemies, and hate your friends. For you have declared this day, that you regard neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it would have pleased you well."
10,19,7,"Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak kindly unto your servants: for I swear by the LORD, if you go not forth, there will not tarry one with you this night: and that will be worse unto you than all the evil that befell you from your youth until now."
10,19,8,"Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king does sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent."
10,19,9,"And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land because of Absalom."
10,19,10,"And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak you not a word of bringing the king back?"
10,19,11,"And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel has come to the king, even to his house."
10,19,12,"You are my brethren, you are my bones and my flesh: why then are you the last to bring back the king?"
10,19,13,"And say you to Amasa, Are you not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you be not captain of the army before me continually in the place of Joab."
10,19,14,"And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return you, and all your servants."
10,19,15,"So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan."
10,19,16,"And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David."
10,19,17,"And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king."
10,19,18,"And there went over a ferryboat to carry over the kingâ€™s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;"
10,19,19,"And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart."
10,19,20,"For your servant does know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king."
10,19,21,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORDâ€™S anointed?"
10,19,22,"And David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?"
10,19,23,"Therefore the king said unto Shimei, You shall not die. And the king swore unto him."
10,19,24,"And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace."
10,19,25,"And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Why went you not with me, Mephibosheth?"
10,19,26,"And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because your servant is lame."
10,19,27,"And he has slandered your servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in your eyes."
10,19,28,"For all of my fatherâ€™s house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet did you set your servant among them that did eat at your own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?"
10,19,29,"And the king said unto him, Why speak you any more of your matters? I have said, You and Ziba divide the land."
10,19,30,"And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house."
10,19,31,"And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan."
10,19,32,"Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king with supplies while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man."
10,19,33,"And the king said unto Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I will feed you with me in Jerusalem."
10,19,34,"And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?"
10,19,35,"I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why then should your servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?"
10,19,36,"Your servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense me with such a reward?"
10,19,37,"Let your servant, I pray you, turn back again, that I may die in my own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto you."
10,19,38,"And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto you: and whatsoever you shall ask of me, that will I do for you."
10,19,39,"And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place."
10,19,40,"Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel."
10,19,41,"And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen you away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all Davidâ€™s men with him, over Jordan?"
10,19,42,"And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: why then are you angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the kingâ€™s cost? or has he given us any gift?"
10,19,43,"And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than you: why then did you despise us, since our advice was first in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel."
10,20,1,"And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel."
10,20,2,"So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah remained loyal to their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem."
10,20,3,"And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in confinement, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood."
10,20,4,"Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and you be here present."
10,20,5,"So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him."
10,20,6,"And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take you your lordâ€™s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get himself fortified cities, and escape us."
10,20,7,"And there went out after him Joabâ€™s men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,8,"When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came before them. And Joabâ€™s garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a belt with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out."
10,20,9,"And Joab said to Amasa, Are you in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him."
10,20,10,"But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joabâ€™s hand: so he struck him with it in the fifth rib, and shed out his entrails to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,11,"And one of Joabâ€™s men stood by him, and said, He that favors Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab."
10,20,12,"And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still."
10,20,13,"When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri."
10,20,14,"And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him."
10,20,15,"And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down."
10,20,16,"Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near here, that I may speak with you."
10,20,17,"And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Are you Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of your handmaid. And he answered, I do hear."
10,20,18,"Then she spoke, saying, They used to speak in former time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter."
10,20,19,"I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why will you swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?"
10,20,20,"And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy."
10,20,21,"The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall."
10,20,22,"Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king."
10,20,23,"Now Joab was over all the army of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:"
10,20,24,"And Adoram was over the forced labor: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:"
10,20,25,"And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:"
10,20,26,"And Ira also the Jairite was a chief minister under David."
10,21,1,"Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites."
10,21,2,"And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)"
10,21,3,"Therefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and with what shall I make the atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?"
10,21,4,"And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shall you kill any man in Israel. And he said, What you shall say, that will I do for you."
10,21,5,"And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the territory of Israel,"
10,21,6,"Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them."
10,21,7,"But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORDâ€™S oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul."
10,21,8,"But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:"
10,21,9,"And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest."
10,21,10,"And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and allowed neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night."
10,21,11,"And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done."
10,21,12,"And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:"
10,21,13,"And he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged."
10,21,14,"And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulcher of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God heeded prayers for the land."
10,21,15,"Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David grew faint."
10,21,16,"And Ishbi-benob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of bronze in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to slay David."
10,21,17,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah aided him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore unto him, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you quench not the light of Israel."
10,21,18,"And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant."
10,21,19,"And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaverâ€™s beam."
10,21,20,"And there was yet again a battle in Gath, where there was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant."
10,21,21,"And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei the brother of David slew him."
10,21,22,"These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants."
10,22,1,"And David spoke unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:"
10,22,2,"And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;"
10,22,3,"The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my savior; you save me from violence."
10,22,4,"I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies."
10,22,5,"When the waves of death surrounded me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;"
10,22,6,"The sorrows of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me;"
10,22,7,"In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears."
10,22,8,"Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was angry."
10,22,9,"There went up smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it."
10,22,10,"He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet."
10,22,11,"And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind."
10,22,12,"And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies."
10,22,13,"Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled."
10,22,14,"The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice."
10,22,15,"And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and vanquished them."
10,22,16,"And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils."
10,22,17,"He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;"
10,22,18,"He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me."
10,22,19,"They confronted me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay."
10,22,20,"He brought me forth also into a broad place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me."
10,22,21,"The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me."
10,22,22,"For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God."
10,22,23,"For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them."
10,22,24,"I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from my iniquity."
10,22,25,"Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eyesight."
10,22,26,"With the merciful you will show yourself merciful, and with the upright man you will show yourself upright."
10,22,27,"With the pure you will show yourself pure; and with the devious you will show yourself shrewd."
10,22,28,"And the afflicted people you will save: but your eyes are upon the haughty, that you may bring them down."
10,22,29,"For you are my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will enlighten my darkness."
10,22,30,"For by you I can run against a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall."
10,22,31,"As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is proven: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him."
10,22,32,"For who is God, except the LORD? and who is a rock, except our God?"
10,22,33,"God is my strength and power: and he makes my way perfect."
10,22,34,"He makes my feet like hindsâ€™ feet: and sets me upon my high places."
10,22,35,"He teaches my hands to make war; so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms."
10,22,36,"You have also given me the shield of your salvation: and your gentleness has made me great."
10,22,37,"You have enlarged my path under me; so that my feet did not slip."
10,22,38,"I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them."
10,22,39,"And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet."
10,22,40,"For you have girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me have you subdued under me."
10,22,41,"You have also given me the necks of my enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me."
10,22,42,"They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not."
10,22,43,"Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad."
10,22,44,"You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people, you have kept me to be head of the nations: a people whom I knew not shall serve me."
10,22,45,"Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me."
10,22,46,"Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid coming out of their hiding places."
10,22,47,"The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be God, the rock of my salvation."
10,22,48,"It is God that avenges me, and that brings down the people under me,"
10,22,49,"And that brings me forth from my enemies: you also have lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: you have delivered me from the violent man."
10,22,50,"Therefore I will give thanks unto you, O LORD, among the nations, and I will sing praises unto your name."
10,22,51,"He is the tower of salvation for his king: and shows mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his descendants forevermore."
10,23,1,"Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,"
10,23,2,"The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and his word was in my tongue."
10,23,3,"The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me,"
10,23,4,""
10,23,5,"Although my house be not so with God; yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he makes it not to grow."
10,23,6,"But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:"
10,23,7,"But the man that shall touch them must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in their place."
10,23,8,"These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lifted up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time."
10,23,9,"And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel had gone away:"
10,23,10,"He arose, and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand stuck to the sword: and the LORD brought about a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to plunder."
10,23,11,"And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines."
10,23,12,"But he stood in the middle of the field, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD brought about a great victory."
10,23,13,"And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim."
10,23,14,"And David was then in a stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem."
10,23,15,"And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!"
10,23,16,"And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink it, but poured it out unto the LORD."
10,23,17,"And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men."
10,23,18,"And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among another three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among these three."
10,23,19,"Was he not most honorable of three? therefore he was their captain: however he attained not unto the first three."
10,23,20,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lion-like heroes of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in a time of snow:"
10,23,21,"And he slew an Egyptian, a handsome man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptianâ€™s hand, and slew him with his own spear."
10,23,22,"These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and won a name among three mighty men."
10,23,23,"He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard."
10,23,24,"Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,"
10,23,25,"Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,"
10,23,26,"Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,"
10,23,27,"Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,"
10,23,28,"Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,"
10,23,29,"Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,"
10,23,30,"Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,"
10,23,31,"Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,"
10,23,32,"Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,"
10,23,33,"Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,"
10,23,34,"Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,"
10,23,35,"Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,"
10,23,36,"Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,"
10,23,37,"Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armorbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,"
10,23,38,"Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,"
10,23,39,"Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all."
10,24,1,"And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah."
10,24,2,"For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number you the people, that I may know the number of the people."
10,24,3,"And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD your God add unto the people, however many they may be, a hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?"
10,24,4,"Nevertheless the kingâ€™s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. And Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel."
10,24,5,"And they passed over Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lies in the midst of the valley of Gad, and toward Jazer:"
10,24,6,"Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and around to Sidon,"
10,24,7,"And came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beer-sheba."
10,24,8,"So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days."
10,24,9,"And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men."
10,24,10,"And Davidâ€™s heart condemned him after he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in what I have done: and now, I beseech you, O LORD, take away the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly."
10,24,11,"And when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, Davidâ€™s seer, saying,"
10,24,12,"Go and say unto David,"
10,24,13,"So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto you in your land? or will you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? or shall there be three daysâ€™ pestilence in your land? now consider, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me."
10,24,14,"And David said unto Gad, I am in a great distress: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man."
10,24,15,"So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men."
10,24,16,"And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD turned from the destruction, and said to the angel that destroyed the people,"
10,24,17,"And David spoke unto the LORD when he saw the angel that struck the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let your hand, I pray you, be against me, and against my fatherâ€™s house."
10,24,18,"And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, erect an altar unto the LORD in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
10,24,19,"And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded."
10,24,20,"And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground."
10,24,21,"And Araunah said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy your threshing floor, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people."
10,24,22,"And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good unto him: behold, here are oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and yokes of the oxen for wood."
10,24,23,"All these things, O King, Araunah gives unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD your God accept you."
10,24,24,"And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it from you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver."
10,24,25,"And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD heeded supplications for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel."
11,1,1,"Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat."
11,1,2,"Therefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may get heat."
11,1,3,"So they sought for a fair young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king."
11,1,4,"And the young woman was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not."
11,1,5,"Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him."
11,1,6,"And his father had not rebuked him at any time in saying, Why have you done so? and he also was a very handsome man; and his mother bore him after Absalom."
11,1,7,"And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him."
11,1,8,"But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah."
11,1,9,"And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and invited all his brethren the kingâ€™s sons, and all the men of Judah the kingâ€™s servants:"
11,1,10,"But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he invited not."
11,1,11,"Therefore Nathan spoke unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith does reign, and David our lord knows it not?"
11,1,12,"Now therefore come, let me, I pray you, give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon."
11,1,13,"Go and get in unto king David, and say unto him, Did not you, my lord, O king, swear unto your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?"
11,1,14,"Behold, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words."
11,1,15,"And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king."
11,1,16,"And Bath-sheba bowed, and knelt before the king. And the king said, What would you?"
11,1,17,"And she said unto him, My lord, you swore by the LORD your God unto your handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne."
11,1,18,"And now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and now, my lord the king, you know it not:"
11,1,19,"And he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army: but Solomon your servant has he not called."
11,1,20,"And you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him."
11,1,21,"Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders."
11,1,22,"And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in."
11,1,23,"And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground."
11,1,24,"And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?"
11,1,25,"For he has gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the kingâ€™s sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah."
11,1,26,"But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon, has he not invited."
11,1,27,"Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you have not showed it unto your servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
11,1,28,"Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the kingâ€™s presence, and stood before the king."
11,1,29,"And the king swore, and said, As the LORD lives, that has redeemed my soul out of all distress,"
11,1,30,"Even as I swore unto you by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my place; even so will I certainly do this day."
11,1,31,"Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and knelt before to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever."
11,1,32,"And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king."
11,1,33,"The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:"
11,1,34,"And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon."
11,1,35,"Then you shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my place: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah."
11,1,36,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too."
11,1,37,"As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David."
11,1,38,"So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king Davidâ€™s mule, and brought him to Gihon."
11,1,39,"And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon."
11,1,40,"And all the people came up after him, and the people played on flutes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with the sound of them."
11,1,41,"And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?"
11,1,42,"And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for you are a valiant man, and bring good tidings."
11,1,43,"And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David has made Solomon king."
11,1,44,"And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the kingâ€™s mule:"
11,1,45,"And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city resounds with it. This is the noise that you have heard."
11,1,46,"And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom."
11,1,47,"And moreover the kingâ€™s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed."
11,1,48,"And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it."
11,1,49,"And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way."
11,1,50,"And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold of the horns of the altar."
11,1,51,"And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon: for, lo, he has caught hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword."
11,1,52,"And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die."
11,1,53,"So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to your house."
11,2,1,"Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,"
11,2,2,"I go the way of all the earth: be strong therefore, and show yourself a man;"
11,2,3,"And keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do, and wherever you turn yourself:"
11,2,4,"That the LORD may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying,"
11,2,5,"Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his belt that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet."
11,2,6,"Do therefore according to your wisdom, and let not his gray head go down to the grave in peace."
11,2,7,"But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother."
11,2,8,"And, behold, you have with you Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword."
11,2,9,"Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for you are a wise man, and know what you ought to do unto him; but his gray head bring you down to the grave with blood."
11,2,10,"So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David."
11,2,11,"And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem."
11,2,12,"Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly."
11,2,13,"And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Come you peaceably? And he said, Peaceably."
11,2,14,"He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto you. And she said, Say on."
11,2,15,"And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: however the kingdom has turned about, and has become my brotherâ€™s: for it was his from the LORD."
11,2,16,"And now I ask one petition of you, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on."
11,2,17,"And he said, Speak, I pray you, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say nay to you,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to be my wife."
11,2,18,"And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for you unto the king."
11,2,19,"Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the kingâ€™s mother; and she sat on his right hand."
11,2,20,"Then she said, I desire one small petition of you; I pray you, say not nay to me. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say nay to you."
11,2,21,"And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife."
11,2,22,"And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah."
11,2,23,"Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life."
11,2,24,"Now therefore, as the LORD lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day."
11,2,25,"And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he struck him down so that he died."
11,2,26,"And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, unto your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted."
11,2,27,"So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh."
11,2,28,"Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar."
11,2,29,"And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, strike him down."
11,2,30,"And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me."
11,2,31,"And the king said unto him, Do as he has said, and strike him down, and bury him; that you may take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father."
11,2,32,"And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who struck down two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing of it, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah."
11,2,33,"Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his descendants forever: but upon David, and upon his descendants, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace forever from the LORD."
11,2,34,"So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and struck him down, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness."
11,2,35,"And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the place of Abiathar."
11,2,36,"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build you a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth from there anywhere."
11,2,37,"For it shall be, that on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, you shall know for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be upon your own head."
11,2,38,"And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days."
11,2,39,"And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants are in Gath."
11,2,40,"And Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath."
11,2,41,"And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again."
11,2,42,"And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make you to swear by the LORD, and admonished you, saying, Know for a certain, on the day you go out, and travel anywhere, that you shall surely die? and you said unto me, The word that I have heard is good."
11,2,43,"Why then have you not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged you with?"
11,2,44,"The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which was in your heart, that you did to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return your wickedness upon your own head;"
11,2,45,"And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever."
11,2,46,"So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out, and struck him, so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon."
11,3,1,"And Solomon made a treaty with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaohâ€™s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about."
11,3,2,"However the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days."
11,3,3,"And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: except that he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places."
11,3,4,"And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar."
11,3,5,"In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said,"
11,3,6,"And Solomon said, You have shown unto your servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you; and you have kept for him this great kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day."
11,3,7,"And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in."
11,3,8,"And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude."
11,3,9,"Give therefore your servant an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this your so great a people?"
11,3,10,"And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing."
11,3,11,"And God said unto him,"
11,3,12,""
11,3,13,""
11,3,14,""
11,3,15,"And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants."
11,3,16,"Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him."
11,3,17,"And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house."
11,3,18,"And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, except we two in the house."
11,3,19,"And this womanâ€™s child died in the night; because she laid on it."
11,3,20,"And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom."
11,3,21,"And when I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead: but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I did bear."
11,3,22,"And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son. And the first said, No; but the dead is your son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king."
11,3,23,"Then said the king, The one says, This is my son that lives, and your son is dead: and the other says, Nay; but your son is dead, and my son is living."
11,3,24,"And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king."
11,3,25,"And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other."
11,3,26,"Then spoke the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her heart yearned for her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and by no means slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor yours, but divide it."
11,3,27,"Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and by no means slay it: she is the mother of it."
11,3,28,"And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice."
11,4,1,"So king Solomon was king over all Israel."
11,4,2,"And these were the princes whom he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,"
11,4,3,"Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder."
11,4,4,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:"
11,4,5,"And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was priest, and the kingâ€™s friend:"
11,4,6,"And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the forced labor."
11,4,7,"And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision."
11,4,8,"And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:"
11,4,9,"The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan:"
11,4,10,"The son of Hesed, in Arubboth; to him belonged Socoh, and all the land of Hepher:"
11,4,11,"The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; who had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as his wife:"
11,4,12,"Baana the son of Ahilud; in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokmeam:"
11,4,13,"The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him belonged the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also belonged the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and bronze bars:"
11,4,14,"Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:"
11,4,15,"Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as his wife:"
11,4,16,"Baana the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:"
11,4,17,"Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:"
11,4,18,"Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin:"
11,4,19,"Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer who was in the land."
11,4,20,"Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and rejoicing."
11,4,21,"And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life."
11,4,22,"And Solomonâ€™s provision for one day was thirty cors of fine flour, and threescore cors of meal,"
11,4,23,"Ten fatted oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, beside harts, gazelles, roebucks, and fatted fowl."
11,4,24,"For he had dominion over all the region on this side of the river, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side of the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him."
11,4,25,"And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon."
11,4,26,"And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen."
11,4,27,"And those officers provided food for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomonâ€™s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing."
11,4,28,"Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge."
11,4,29,"And God gave Solomon wisdom and exceedingly great understanding, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore."
11,4,30,"And Solomonâ€™s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt."
11,4,31,"For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about."
11,4,32,"And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five."
11,4,33,"And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springs out of the wall: he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes."
11,4,34,"And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom."
11,5,1,"And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father: for Hiram was always a lover of David."
11,5,2,"And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,"
11,5,3,"You know how that David my father could not build a house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet."
11,5,4,"But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor misfortune."
11,5,5,"And, behold, I purpose to build a house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke unto David my father, saying,"
11,5,6,"Now therefore command you that they cut me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with your servants: and unto you will I give wages for your servants according to all that you shall appoint: for you know that there is not among us any that has skill to cut timber like unto the Sidonians."
11,5,7,"And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, who has given unto David a wise son over this great people."
11,5,8,"And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which you sent to me: and I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir."
11,5,9,"My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and you shall receive them: and you shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household."
11,5,10,"So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire."
11,5,11,"And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat for food to his household, and twenty thousand cors of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year."
11,5,12,"And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they both made a treaty together."
11,5,13,"And king Solomon raised forced labor out of all Israel; and the forced labor was thirty thousand men."
11,5,14,"And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by shifts: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the forced labor."
11,5,15,"And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand quarried stone in the mountains;"
11,5,16,"Besides the chief of Solomonâ€™s officers who were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who ruled over the people that labored in the work."
11,5,17,"And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewn stones, to lay the foundation of the house."
11,5,18,"And Solomonâ€™s builders and Hiramâ€™s builders did hew them, and the men of Gebal: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house."
11,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomonâ€™s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD."
11,6,2,"As for the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits."
11,6,3,"And the porch in front of the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof in front of the house."
11,6,4,"And for the house he made windows of narrow lights."
11,6,5,"And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the inner sanctuary: and he made chambers round about:"
11,6,6,"The lowest chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for outside in the wall of the house he made narrowed ledges round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house."
11,6,7,"And the house, when it was being built, was built of stone made ready before it was brought there: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was being built."
11,6,8,"The door for the lowest chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third."
11,6,9,"So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar."
11,6,10,"And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar."
11,6,11,"And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,"
11,6,12,""
11,6,13,""
11,6,14,"So Solomon built the house, and finished it."
11,6,15,"And he built the walls of the house inside with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir."
11,6,16,"And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it inside, even for the inner sanctuary, even for the most holy place."
11,6,17,"And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long."
11,6,18,"And the cedar of the house inside was carved with knobs and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen."
11,6,19,"And the inner sanctuary he prepared in the house inside, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD."
11,6,20,"And the inner sanctuary was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and also covered the altar which was of cedar."
11,6,21,"So Solomon overlaid the house inside with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the inner sanctuary; and he overlaid it with gold."
11,6,22,"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold."
11,6,23,"And within the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high."
11,6,24,"And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the tip of the one wing unto the tip of the other were ten cubits."
11,6,25,"And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one size."
11,6,26,"The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub."
11,6,27,"And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the middle of the house."
11,6,28,"And he overlaid the cherubim with gold."
11,6,29,"And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms."
11,6,30,"And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, in the inner and outer rooms."
11,6,31,"And for the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall."
11,6,32,"The two doors also were of olive wood; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees."
11,6,33,"So also he made for the door of the temple posts of olive wood, a fourth part of the wall."
11,6,34,"And the two doors were of fir wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding."
11,6,35,"And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work."
11,6,36,"And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams."
11,6,37,"In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Ziv:"
11,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all its plans. So was he seven years in building it."
11,7,1,"But Solomon was building his own house for thirteen years, and he finished all his house."
11,7,2,"He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length of it was a hundred cubits, and the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars."
11,7,3,"And it was covered with cedar above the beams, that lay on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row."
11,7,4,"And there were windows in three rows, and window was opposite window in three tiers."
11,7,5,"And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and window was opposite window in three tiers."
11,7,6,"And he made a porch of pillars; the length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth of it thirty cubits: and the porch was in front of them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were in front of them."
11,7,7,"Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other."
11,7,8,"And his house where he dwelt had another court inside the porch, which was of like workmanship. Solomon made also a house for Pharaohâ€™s daughter, whom he had taken as his wife, like unto this porch."
11,7,9,"All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of cut stones, sawed with saws, inside and out, even from the foundation unto the eaves, and also on the outside toward the great court."
11,7,10,"And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits."
11,7,11,"And above were costly stones, after the measures of cut stones, and cedars."
11,7,12,"And the great court round about was with three rows of cut stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house."
11,7,13,"And king Solomon sent and brought Hiram out of Tyre."
11,7,14,"He was a widowâ€™s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in bronze. And he came to king Solomon, and did all his work."
11,7,15,"For he cast two pillars of bronze, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of each."
11,7,16,"And he made two capitals of molten bronze, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits:"
11,7,17,"And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital."
11,7,18,"And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other capital."
11,7,19,"And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits."
11,7,20,"And the capitals upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the rounded projection which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other capital."
11,7,21,"And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz."
11,7,22,"And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished."
11,7,23,"And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and its height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference."
11,7,24,"And under the brim of it round about there were knobs compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knobs were cast in two rows, when it was cast."
11,7,25,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hind parts were inward."
11,7,26,"And it was a handbreadth thick, and the brim thereof was shaped like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths."
11,7,27,"And he made ten stands of bronze; four cubits was the length of one stand, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it."
11,7,28,"And the work of the stands was on this manner: they had panels, and the panels were between the frames:"
11,7,29,"And on the panels that were between the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim: and upon the frames there was a pedestal above: and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths made of hammered work."
11,7,30,"And every stand had four bronze wheels, and axles of bronze: and the four corners thereof had supports: under the laver were molten supports, at the side of every wreath."
11,7,31,"And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round like the shape of a pedestal, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were engravings with their panels, foursquare, not round."
11,7,32,"And under the panels were four wheels; and the axles of the wheels were joined to the stand: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half."
11,7,33,"And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axles, and their rims, and their hubs, and their spokes, were all molten."
11,7,34,"And there were four supports to the four corners of each stand: and the supports were of one piece with the stand itself."
11,7,35,"And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high: and on the top of the stand the frames thereof and the panels thereof were all one piece."
11,7,36,"For on the plates of the frames thereof, and on the panels thereof, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each one, and wreaths round about."
11,7,37,"After this manner he made the ten stands: all of them were of the same casting, of the same measure, and the same shape."
11,7,38,"Then made he ten lavers of bronze: each laver contained forty baths: and each laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten stands was one laver."
11,7,39,"And he put five stands on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house toward the southeast."
11,7,40,"And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished doing all the work that he made for king Solomon for the house of the LORD:"
11,7,41,"The two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars;"
11,7,42,"And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;"
11,7,43,"And the ten stands, and ten lavers on the stands;"
11,7,44,"And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;"
11,7,45,"And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: and all these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright bronze."
11,7,46,"In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan."
11,7,47,"And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were very many: neither was the weight of the bronze measured."
11,7,48,"And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, on which was the showbread,"
11,7,49,"And the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the inner sanctuary, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,"
11,7,50,"And the bowls, and the wick trimmers, and the basins, and the ladles, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner room, the most holy place, and for the doors of the main hall of the temple."
11,7,51,"So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the furnishings, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD."
11,8,1,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chiefs of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion."
11,8,2,"And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month."
11,8,3,"And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark."
11,8,4,"And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up."
11,8,5,"And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude."
11,8,6,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim."
11,8,7,"For the cherubim spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above."
11,8,8,"And they drew out the poles, so that the ends of the poles were seen out in the holy place before the inner sanctuary, and they were not seen outside: and there they are unto this day."
11,8,9,"There was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt."
11,8,10,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,"
11,8,11,"So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD."
11,8,12,"Then spoke Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness."
11,8,13,"I have surely built you a house to dwell in, a settled place for you to abide in forever."
11,8,14,"And the king turned his face around, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)"
11,8,15,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth unto David my father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,"
11,8,16,""
11,8,17,"And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel."
11,8,18,"And the LORD said unto David my father,"
11,8,19,""
11,8,20,"And the LORD has performed his word that he spoke, and I am risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel."
11,8,21,"And I have set there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt."
11,8,22,"And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:"
11,8,23,"And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keeps covenant and mercy with your servants that walk before you with all their heart:"
11,8,24,"Who has kept with your servant David my father what you promised him: you spoke also with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day."
11,8,25,"Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you promised him, saying,"
11,8,26,"And now, O God of Israel, let your word, I pray you, be confirmed, which you spoke unto your servant David my father."
11,8,27,"But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built?"
11,8,28,"Yet have you respect unto the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which your servant prays before you today:"
11,8,29,"That your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said,"
11,8,30,"And hearken to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear in heaven your dwelling place: and when you hear, forgive."
11,8,31,"If any man trespasses against his neighbor, and an oath is required of him to cause him to swear, and the oath comes before your altar in this house:"
11,8,32,"Then hear you in heaven, and act, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness."
11,8,33,"When your people Israel are defeated before the enemy, because they have sinned against you, and shall turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray, and make supplication unto you in this house:"
11,8,34,"Then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which you gave unto their fathers."
11,8,35,"When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you afflict them:"
11,8,36,"Then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, that you teach them the good way in which they should walk, and give rain upon your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance."
11,8,37,"If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blight, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;"
11,8,38,"Whatsoever prayer and supplication be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall know every man the affliction of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:"
11,8,39,"Then hear you in heaven your dwelling place, and forgive, and act, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the children of men;)"
11,8,40,"That they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave unto our fathers."
11,8,41,"Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of your people Israel, but comes out of a far country for your nameâ€™s sake;"
11,8,42,"(For they shall hear of your great name, and of your strong hand, and of your outstretched arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;"
11,8,43,"Hear you in heaven your dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls to you for: that all people of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have built, is called by your name."
11,8,44,"If your people go out to battle against their enemy, wherever you shall send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house that I have built for your name:"
11,8,45,"Then hear you in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
11,8,46,"If they sin against you, (for there is no man that sins not,) and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;"
11,8,47,"Yet if they shall come to themselves in the land where they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto you in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;"
11,8,48,"And so return unto you with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto you toward their land, which you gave unto their fathers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name:"
11,8,49,"Then hear you their prayer and their supplication in heaven your dwelling place, and maintain their cause,"
11,8,50,"And forgive your people that have sinned against you, and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:"
11,8,51,"For they are your people, and your inheritance, which you brought forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:"
11,8,52,"That your eyes may be open unto the supplication of your servant, and unto the supplication of your people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto you."
11,8,53,"For you did separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be your inheritance, as you spoke by the hand of Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD."
11,8,54,"And it was so, that when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven."
11,8,55,"And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,"
11,8,56,"Blessed be the LORD, that has given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant."
11,8,57,"The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:"
11,8,58,"That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers."
11,8,59,"And let these my words, with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be near unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:"
11,8,60,"That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else."
11,8,61,"Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day."
11,8,62,"And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD."
11,8,63,"And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD."
11,8,64,"The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brass altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings."
11,8,65,"And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days."
11,8,66,"On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people."
11,9,1,"And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the kingâ€™s house, and all Solomonâ€™s desire which he was pleased to do,"
11,9,2,"That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon."
11,9,3,"And the LORD said unto him,"
11,9,4,""
11,9,5,""
11,9,6,""
11,9,7,""
11,9,8,""
11,9,9,""
11,9,10,"And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the kingâ€™s house,"
11,9,11,"(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee."
11,9,12,"And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not."
11,9,13,"And he said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day."
11,9,14,"And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold."
11,9,15,"And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer."
11,9,16,"For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burned it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomonâ€™s wife."
11,9,17,"And Solomon built Gezer, and lower Beth-horon,"
11,9,18,"And Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,"
11,9,19,"And all the cities of storage that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion."
11,9,20,"And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel,"
11,9,21,"Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, of those did Solomon conscript for forced labor unto this day."
11,9,22,"But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no slaves: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen."
11,9,23,"These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomonâ€™s work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that did the work."
11,9,24,"But Pharaohâ€™s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo."
11,9,25,"And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house."
11,9,26,"And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom."
11,9,27,"And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, seaman that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon."
11,9,28,"And they came to Ophir, and brought from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon."
11,10,1,"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with hard questions."
11,10,2,"And she came to Jerusalem with a very great caravan, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was in her heart."
11,10,3,"And Solomon answered her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king, which he told her not."
11,10,4,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomonâ€™s wisdom, and the house that he had built,"
11,10,5,"And the food of his table, and the seating of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his entryway by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her."
11,10,6,"And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom."
11,10,7,"However I believed not the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: your wisdom and prosperity exceeds the fame which I heard."
11,10,8,"Happy are your men, happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, and that hear your wisdom."
11,10,9,"Blessed be the LORD your God, who delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel forever, therefore he made you king, to execute justice and righteousness."
11,10,10,"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a very great quantity, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon."
11,10,11,"And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great quantities of almug wood, and precious stones."
11,10,12,"And the king made of the almug wood pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the kingâ€™s house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug wood, nor was seen such unto this day."
11,10,13,"And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants."
11,10,14,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,"
11,10,15,"Besides that he received of the merchantmen, and of the traffic of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country."
11,10,16,"And king Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one large shield."
11,10,17,"And he made three hundred shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon."
11,10,18,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold."
11,10,19,"The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round at the back: and there were arms on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the arms."
11,10,20,"And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like of it made in any kingdom."
11,10,21,"And all king Solomonâ€™s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon."
11,10,22,"For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."
11,10,23,"So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom."
11,10,24,"And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart."
11,10,25,"And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a set rate year by year."
11,10,26,"And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."

11,11,5,"For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites."
11,11,6,"And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father."
11,11,7,"Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon."
11,11,8,"And likewise did he for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed unto their gods."

11,11,22,"Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what have you lacked with me, that, behold, you seek to go to your own country? And he answered, Nothing: only let me go anyway."
11,11,23,"And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliada, who fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:"

11,11,27,"And this was the reason that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father."
11,11,28,"And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph."

11,12,10,"And the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him, saying, Thus shall you speak unto this people that spoke unto you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter unto us; thus shall you say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my fatherâ€™s loins."
11,12,11,"And now whereas my father did lay upon you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father has chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."

11,16,11,"And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one single male, neither of his relatives, nor of his friends."
11,16,12,"Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,"
11,16,13,"For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities."
11,16,14,"Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,16,15,"In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines."
11,16,16,"And the people that were encamped heard it said, Zimri has conspired, and has also slain the king: therefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp."
11,16,17,"And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah."
11,16,18,"And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the kingâ€™s house, and burned the kingâ€™s house over him with fire, and he died,"
11,16,19,"For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin."
11,16,20,"Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he committed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,16,21,"Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri."
11,16,22,"But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned."
11,16,23,"In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years he reigned in Tirzah."
11,16,24,"And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria."
11,16,25,"But Omri did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him."
11,16,26,"For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities."
11,16,27,"Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,16,28,"So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his place."
11,16,29,"And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years."
11,16,30,"And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him."
11,16,31,"And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him."
11,16,32,"And he raised up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria."
11,16,33,"And Ahab made an idol pole; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him."
11,16,34,"In his days did Hiel of Bethel build Jericho: he laid the foundation of it at the cost of Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates of it at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun."
11,17,1,"And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word."
11,17,2,"And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,"
11,17,3,""
11,17,4,""
11,17,5,"So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is east of the Jordan."
11,17,6,"And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank of the brook."
11,17,7,"And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land."
11,17,8,"And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,"
11,17,9,""
11,17,10,"So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray you, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink."
11,17,11,"And as she was going to bring it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray you, a morsel of bread in your hand."
11,17,12,"And she said, As the LORD your God lives, I have not bread, but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a jar: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and prepare it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die."
11,17,13,"And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as you have said: but make me from it a little loaf first, and bring it unto me, and after that make some for you and for your son."
11,17,14,"For thus says the LORD God of Israel,"
11,17,15,"And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days."
11,17,16,"And the barrel of meal did not run out, neither did the jar of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Elijah."
11,17,17,"And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe, that there was no breath left in him."
11,17,18,"And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with you, O you man of God? are you come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?"
11,17,19,"And he said unto her, Give me your son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he was staying, and laid him upon his own bed."
11,17,20,"And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, have you also brought tragedy upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?"
11,17,21,"And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray you, let this childâ€™s soul come into him again."
11,17,22,"And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived."
11,17,23,"And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, your son lives."
11,17,24,"And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in your mouth is truth."
11,18,1,"And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth."
11,18,2,"And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And there was a severe famine in Samaria."
11,18,3,"And Ahab called Obadiah, who was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:"
11,18,4,"For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)"
11,18,5,"And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: perhaps we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the animals."
11,18,6,"So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself."
11,18,7,"And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Are you my lord Elijah?"
11,18,8,"And he answered him, I am: go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here."
11,18,9,"And he said, How have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?"
11,18,10,"As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found you not."
11,18,11,"And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here."
11,18,12,"And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the spirit of the LORD shall carry you I know not where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he shall slay me: but I your servant fear the LORD from my youth."
11,18,13,"Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORDâ€™S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?"
11,18,14,"And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me."
11,18,15,"And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself unto him today."
11,18,16,"So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah."
11,18,17,"And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Are you he that troubles Israel?"
11,18,18,"And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your fatherâ€™s house, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and you have followed Baalim."
11,18,19,"Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the idol poles four hundred, who eat at Jezebelâ€™s table."
11,18,20,"So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel."
11,18,21,"And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long do you halt between two opinions? if the LORD is God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word."
11,18,22,"Then said Eliajah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baalâ€™s prophets are four hundred and fifty men."
11,18,23,"Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under it: and I will prepare the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under it:"
11,18,24,"And call you on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answers by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken."
11,18,25,"And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and prepare it first; for you are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under it."
11,18,26,"And they took the bullock which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made."
11,18,27,"And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps, and must be awaked."
11,18,28,"And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon them."
11,18,29,"And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded."
11,18,30,"And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down."
11,18,31,"And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying,"
11,18,32,"And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench around the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed."
11,18,33,"And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood."
11,18,34,"And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time."
11,18,35,"And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water."
11,18,36,"And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word."
11,18,37,"Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that you are the LORD God, and that you have turned their heart back again."
11,18,38,"Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench."
11,18,39,"And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God."
11,18,40,"And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there."
11,18,41,"And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain."
11,18,42,"So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,"
11,18,43,"And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times."
11,18,44,"And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there arises a little cloud out of the sea, like a manâ€™s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare your chariot, and get you down, that the rain stops you not."
11,18,45,"And it came to pass in a little while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel."
11,18,46,"And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel."
11,19,1,"And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword."
11,19,2,"Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time."
11,19,3,"And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there."
11,19,4,"But he himself went a dayâ€™s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers."
11,19,5,"And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat."
11,19,6,"And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid himself down again."
11,19,7,"And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for you."
11,19,8,"And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God."
11,19,9,"And he came there unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him,"
11,19,10,"And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."
11,19,11,"And he said,"
11,19,12,"And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice."
11,19,13,"And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said,"
11,19,14,"And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away."
11,19,15,"And the LORD said unto him,"
11,19,16,""
11,19,17,""
11,19,18,""
11,19,19,"So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him."
11,19,20,"And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to you?"
11,19,21,"And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him."
11,20,1,"And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it."
11,20,2,"And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus says Ben-hadad,"
11,20,3,"Your silver and your gold is mine; your wives also and your children, even the fairest, are mine."
11,20,4,"And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to your saying, I am yours, and all that I have."
11,20,5,"And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent unto you, saying, You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and your children;"
11,20,6,"Yet I will send my servants unto you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away."
11,20,7,"Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeks trouble: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not."
11,20,8,"And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent."
11,20,9,"Therefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that you did send for to your servant at the first I will do: but this thing I will not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again."
11,20,10,"And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for a handful for each of the people that follow me."
11,20,11,"And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girds on his armor boast himself as he that puts it off."
11,20,12,"And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city."
11,20,13,"And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying,"
11,20,14,"And Ahab said, By whom? And he said,"
11,20,15,"Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand."
11,20,16,"And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him."
11,20,17,"And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria."
11,20,18,"And he said, If they be come out for peace, take them alive; or if they be come out for war, take them alive."
11,20,19,"So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them."
11,20,20,"And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen."
11,20,21,"And the king of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter."
11,20,22,"And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen yourself, and consider, and see what you should do: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you."
11,20,23,"And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they."
11,20,24,"And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their places:"
11,20,25,"And number you an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so."
11,20,26,"And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel."
11,20,27,"And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country."
11,20,28,"And there came a man of God, and spoke unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus says the LORD,"
11,20,29,"And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day."
11,20,30,"But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber."
11,20,31,"And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray you, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: perhaps he will save your life."
11,20,32,"So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Your servant Ben-hadad says, I pray you, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother."
11,20,33,"Now the men did diligently observe whether any sign of mercy would come from him, and did quickly catch it: and they said, Your brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot."
11,20,34,"And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from your father, I will restore; and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send you away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away."
11,20,35,"And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbor by the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray you. And the man refused to smite him."
11,20,36,"Then said he unto him, Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as you are departed from me, a lion shall slay you. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him."
11,20,37,"Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray you. And the man struck him, so that in smiting he wounded him."
11,20,38,"So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face."
11,20,39,"And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall your life be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver."
11,20,40,"And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall your judgment be; you have decided it."
11,20,41,"And he hurried, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets."
11,20,42,"And he said unto him, Thus says the LORD,"
11,20,43,"And the king of Israel went to his house sullen and displeased, and came to Samaria."
11,21,1,"And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, near by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria."
11,21,2,"And Ahab spoke unto Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you the worth of it in money."
11,21,3,"And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto you."
11,21,4,"And Ahab came into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid himself down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread."
11,21,5,"But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?"
11,21,6,"And he said unto her, Because I spoke unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard."
11,21,7,"And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
11,21,8,"So she wrote letters in Ahabâ€™s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth."
11,21,9,"And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:"
11,21,10,"And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, You did blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die."
11,21,11,"And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them."
11,21,12,"They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people."
11,21,13,"And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, so that he died."
11,21,14,"Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead."
11,21,15,"And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead."
11,21,16,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it."
11,21,17,"And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,"
11,21,18,""
11,21,19,""
11,21,20,"And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found you: because you have sold yourself to work evil in the sight of the LORD."
11,21,21,""
11,21,22,""
11,21,23,"And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying,"
11,21,24,"He that dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and he that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat."
11,21,25,"But there was none like unto Ahab, who did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up."
11,21,26,"And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel."
11,21,27,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly."
11,21,28,"And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,"
11,21,29,""
11,22,1,"And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel."
11,22,2,"And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel."
11,22,3,"And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know you that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?"
11,22,4,"And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
11,22,5,"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray you, at the word of the LORD today."
11,22,6,"Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king."
11,22,7,"And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?"
11,22,8,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so."
11,22,9,"Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah."
11,22,10,"And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in the threshing floor in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them."
11,22,11,"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus says the LORD, With these shall you push the Syrians, until you have consumed them."
11,22,12,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the kingâ€™s hand."
11,22,13,"And the messenger that had gone to call Micaiah spoke unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let your word, I pray you, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good."
11,22,14,"And Micaiah said, As the LORD lives, what the LORD says unto me, that will I speak."
11,22,15,"So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king."
11,22,16,"And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure you that you tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?"
11,22,17,"And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said,"
11,22,18,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?"
11,22,19,"And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left."
11,22,20,"And the LORD said,"
11,22,21,"And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him."
11,22,22,"And the LORD said unto him,"
11,22,23,"Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets, and the LORD has spoken evil concerning you."
11,22,24,"But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto you?"
11,22,25,"And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see in that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself."
11,22,26,"And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the kingâ€™s son;"
11,22,27,"And say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace."
11,22,28,"And Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you."
11,22,29,"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead."
11,22,30,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put you on your robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle."
11,22,31,"But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, but only with the king of Israel."
11,22,32,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out."
11,22,33,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him."
11,22,34,"And a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor: therefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the battle; for I am wounded."
11,22,35,"And the battle increased that day: and the king was propped up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at evening: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot."
11,22,36,"And there went a proclamation throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country."
11,22,37,"So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria."
11,22,38,"And someone washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according unto the word of the LORD which he spoke."
11,22,39,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
11,22,40,"So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place."
11,22,41,"And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel."
11,22,42,"Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi."
11,22,43,"And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places."
11,22,44,"And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel."
11,22,45,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he made war, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
11,22,46,"And the remnant of the male prostitutes, who remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land."
11,22,47,"There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king."
11,22,48,"Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber."
11,22,49,"Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not."
11,22,50,"And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his place."
11,22,51,"Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel."
11,22,52,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:"
11,22,53,"For he served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done."
12,1,1,"Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab."
12,1,2,"And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease."
12,1,3,"But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite,"
12,1,4,""
12,1,5,"And when the messengers returned unto him, he said unto them, Why are you now returned ?"
12,1,6,"And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, return unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus says the LORD,"
12,1,7,"And he said unto them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?"
12,1,8,"And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and wearing a belt of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite."
12,1,9,"Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty men. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of a hill. And he spoke unto him, You man of God, the king has said, Come down."
12,1,10,"And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty men. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."
12,1,11,"Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty men. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly."
12,1,12,"And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty men. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."
12,1,13,"And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty men. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty men your servants, be precious in your sight."
12,1,14,"Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in your sight."
12,1,15,"And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king."
12,1,16,"And he said unto him, Thus says the LORD,"
12,1,17,"So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son."
12,1,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,2,1,"And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal."
12,2,2,"And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Beth-el."
12,2,3,"And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from over you today? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold your peace."
12,2,4,"And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho."
12,2,5,"And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from over you today? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold your peace."
12,2,6,"And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray you, here; for the LORD has sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And they both went on."
12,2,7,"And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view from afar off: and they both stood by the Jordan."
12,2,8,"And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground."
12,2,9,"And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me."
12,2,10,"And he said, You have asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so unto you; but if not, it shall not be so."
12,2,11,"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and separated them both; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."
12,2,12,"And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces."
12,2,13,"He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;"
12,2,14,"And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had struck the waters, they parted to the one side and to the other: and Elisha went over."
12,2,15,"And when the sons of the prophets who were from Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him."
12,2,16,"And they said unto him, Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master: lest peradventure the spirit of the LORD has taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, You shall not send them."
12,2,17,"And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send them. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not."
12,2,18,"And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?"
12,2,19,"And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is bad, and the ground barren."
12,2,20,"And he said, Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it. And they brought it to him."
12,2,21,"And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus says the LORD,"
12,2,22,"So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke."
12,2,23,"And he went up from there unto Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth youths out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, you bald head; go up, you bald head."
12,2,24,"And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two of the youths."
12,2,25,"And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria."
12,3,1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years."
12,3,2,"And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made."
12,3,3,"Nevertheless he clung unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not from them."
12,3,4,"And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and rendered unto the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool."
12,3,5,"But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel."
12,3,6,"And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel."
12,3,7,"And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses."
12,3,8,"And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom."
12,3,9,"So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they made a circuit of seven daysâ€™ journey: and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them."
12,3,10,"And the king of Israel said, Alas! the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!"
12,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israelâ€™s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah."
12,3,12,"And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him."
12,3,13,"And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? get you to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab."
12,3,14,"And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you."
12,3,15,"But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him."
12,3,16,"And he said, Thus says the LORD,"
12,3,17,"For thus says the LORD,"
12,3,18,"And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand."
12,3,19,"And you shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up all wells of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones."
12,3,20,"And it came to pass in the morning, when the grain offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water."
12,3,21,"And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armor, and older, and stood in the border."
12,3,22,"And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:"
12,3,23,"And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil."
12,3,24,"And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck down the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country."
12,3,25,"And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and covered it; and they stopped up all the wells of water, and cut down all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they its stones; the slingers surrounded it, and conquered it."
12,3,26,"And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not."
12,3,27,"Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there came great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land."
12,4,1,"Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor has come to take unto him my two sons to be slaves."
12,4,2,"And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for you? tell me, what have you in the house? And she said, Your handmaid has not anything in the house, except a pot of oil."
12,4,3,"Then he said, Go, borrow you vessels outside of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few."
12,4,4,"And when you are come in, you shall shut the door upon you and upon your sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you shall set aside that which is full."
12,4,5,"So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out."
12,4,6,"And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stopped flowing."
12,4,7,"Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your children from the rest."
12,4,8,"And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a wealthy woman; and she urged him to eat some food. And so it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat some food."
12,4,9,"And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us continually."
12,4,10,"Let us make a little chamber, I pray you, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a lampstand: and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in there."
12,4,11,"And it fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there."
12,4,12,"And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him."
12,4,13,"And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, you have cared for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the army? And she answered, I dwell among my own people."
12,4,14,"And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she has no child, and her husband is old."
12,4,15,"And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door."
12,4,16,"And he said, About this season, next year, you shall embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, you man of God, do not lie unto your handmaid."
12,4,17,"And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that time that Elisha had said unto her, according to the appointed time."
12,4,18,"And when the child was grown, on a certain day, he went out to his father to the reapers."
12,4,19,"And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother."
12,4,20,"And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died."
12,4,21,"And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out."
12,4,22,"And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the young men, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again."
12,4,23,"And he said, Why will you go to him today? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well."
12,4,24,"Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not your riding for me, except I bid you."
12,4,25,"So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:"
12,4,26,"Run now, I pray you, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well."
12,4,27,"And when she came to the man of God at the mountain, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is bitter within her: and the LORD has hid it from me, and has not told me."
12,4,28,"Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?"
12,4,29,"Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, greet him not; and if any greet you, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child."
12,4,30,"And the mother of the child said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he arose, and followed her."
12,4,31,"And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child has not awakened."
12,4,32,"And when Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed."
12,4,33,"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon the two of them, and prayed unto the LORD."
12,4,34,"And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child became warm."
12,4,35,"Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes."
12,4,36,"And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up your son."
12,4,37,"Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out."
12,4,38,"And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets."
12,4,39,"And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it his lap full of wild gourds, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not."
12,4,40,"So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O you man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat of it."
12,4,41,"But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot."
12,4,42,"And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat."
12,4,43,"And his servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus says the LORD,"
12,4,44,"So he set it before them, and they did eat, and had some left, according to the word of the LORD."
12,5,1,"Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valor, but he was a leper."
12,5,2,"And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naamanâ€™s wife."
12,5,3,"And she said unto her mistress, Would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would cure him of his leprosy."
12,5,4,"And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel."
12,5,5,"And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment."
12,5,6,"And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto you, behold, I have with it sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy."
12,5,7,"And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man does send unto me to cure a man of his leprosy? therefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks a quarrel against me."
12,5,8,"And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you torn your clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel."
12,5,9,"So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha."
12,5,10,"And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean."
12,5,11,"But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and cure the leprosy."
12,5,12,"Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage."
12,5,13,"And his servants came near, and spoke unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid you do some great thing, would you not have done it? how much rather then, when he says to you, Wash, and be clean?"
12,5,14,"Then he went down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh was restored again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean."
12,5,15,"And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray you, take a blessing from your servant."
12,5,16,"But he said, As the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused."
12,5,17,"And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray you, be given to your servant two mulesâ€™ burden of earth? for your servant will never offer either burnt offering or sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD."
12,5,18,"In this thing the LORD pardon your servant, that when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this thing."
12,5,19,"And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way."
12,5,20,"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving from his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD lives, I will run after him, and take something from him."
12,5,21,"So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?"
12,5,22,"And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there has come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray you, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments."
12,5,23,"And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bore them before him."
12,5,24,"And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and put them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed."
12,5,25,"But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, From where come you, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant went nowhere."
12,5,26,"And he said unto him, Went not my heart with you, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?"
12,5,27,"The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cling unto you, and unto your descendants forever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow."
12,6,1,"And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with you is too small for us."
12,6,2,"Let us go, we pray you, unto the Jordan, and take there every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go."
12,6,3,"And one said, Be content, I pray you, and go with your servants. And he answered, I will go."
12,6,4,"So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood."
12,6,5,"But as one was cutting down a tree, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed."
12,6,6,"And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in there; and the iron did float."
12,6,7,"Therefore he said, Take it up to you. And he put out his hand, and took it."
12,6,8,"Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp."
12,6,9,"And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you pass not this place; for there the Syrians have come down."
12,6,10,"And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice."
12,6,11,"Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?"
12,6,12,"And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber."
12,6,13,"And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and bring him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan."
12,6,14,"Therefore sent he there horses, and chariots, and a great army: and they came by night, and surrounded the city."
12,6,15,"And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an army compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! what shall we do?"
12,6,16,"And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them."
12,6,17,"And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray you, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha."
12,6,18,"And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Strike these people, I pray you, with blindness. And he struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha."
12,6,19,"And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek. But he led them to Samaria."
12,6,20,"And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria."
12,6,21,"And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I slay them? shall I slay them?"
12,6,22,"And he answered, You shall not slay them: would you slay those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master."
12,6,23,"And he prepared a great feast for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel."
12,6,24,"And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria."
12,6,25,"And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until a donkeyâ€™s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of doveâ€™s dung for five pieces of silver."
12,6,26,"And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king."
12,6,27,"And he said, If the LORD does not help you, how shall I help you? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?"
12,6,28,"And the king said unto her, What ails you? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow."
12,6,29,"So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give your son, that we may eat him: and she has hid her son."
12,6,30,"And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth beneath upon his flesh."
12,6,31,"Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day."
12,6,32,"But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See you how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his masterâ€™s feet behind him?"
12,6,33,"And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; why should I wait for the LORD any longer?"
12,7,1,"Then Elisha said, Hear you the word of the LORD; Thus says the LORD,"
12,7,2,"Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it."
12,7,3,"And there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?"
12,7,4,"If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the army of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die."
12,7,5,"And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the edge of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there."
12,7,6,"For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us."
12,7,7,"Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life."
12,7,8,"And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried from there also, and went and hid it."
12,7,9,"Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the kingâ€™s household."
12,7,10,"So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and donkeys tied, and the tents as they were."
12,7,11,"And he called the porters; and they told it to the kingâ€™s house inside."
12,7,12,"And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city."
12,7,13,"And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray you, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see."
12,7,14,"They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, Go and see."
12,7,15,"And they went after them unto the Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king."
12,7,16,"And the people went out, and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD."
12,7,17,"And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him."
12,7,18,"And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:"
12,7,19,"And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it."
12,7,20,"And so it happened unto him: for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died."
12,8,1,"Then spoke Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn: for the LORD has called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years."
12,8,2,"And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years."
12,8,3,"And it came to pass at the seven yearsâ€™ end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land."
12,8,4,"And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray you, all the great things that Elisha has done."
12,8,5,"And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life."
12,8,6,"And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now."
12,8,7,"And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God has come here."
12,8,8,"And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?"
12,8,9,"So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camelsâ€™ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Your son Ben-hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?"
12,8,10,"And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, You may certainly recover: however the LORD has shown me that he shall surely die."
12,8,11,"And he set his countenance and stared, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept."
12,8,12,"And Hazael said, Why do you weep my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds will you set on fire, and their young men will you slay with the sword, and will dash their children, and rip up their women with child."
12,8,13,"And Hazael said, But what, is your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD has shown me that you shall be king over Syria."
12,8,14,"So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to you? And he answered, He told me that you should surely recover."
12,8,15,"And it came to pass on the next day, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead."
12,8,16,"And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign."
12,8,17,"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem."
12,8,18,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD."
12,8,19,"Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servantâ€™s sake, as he promised him to give him always a light, and to his children."
12,8,20,"In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves."
12,8,21,"So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents."
12,8,22,"Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time."
12,8,23,"And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,8,24,"And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead."
12,8,25,"In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign."
12,8,26,"Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel."
12,8,27,"And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab."
12,8,28,"And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram."
12,8,29,"And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick."
12,9,1,"And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up your loins, and take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead:"
12,9,2,"And when you come there, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and take him to an inner chamber;"
12,9,3,"Then take the flask of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus says the LORD,"
12,9,4,"So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead."
12,9,5,"And when he came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting; and he said, I have a message to you, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of us? And he said, To you, O captain."
12,9,6,"And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD God of Israel,"

12,9,11,"Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? why came this mad fellow to you? And he said unto them, You know the man, and his communication."
12,9,12,"And they said, That is not true; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying, Thus says the LORD,"
12,9,13,"Then they hastened, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king."
12,9,14,"So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had defended Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, against Hazael king of Syria."
12,9,15,"But king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If this is your mind, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel."
12,9,16,"So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram."
12,9,17,"And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?"
12,9,18,"So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me. And the watchman reported, saying, The messenger came to them, but he comes not back again."
12,9,19,"Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus says the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me."
12,9,20,"And the watchman reported, saying, He came even unto them, and comes not back: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously."
12,9,21,"And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the property of Naboth the Jezreelite."
12,9,22,"And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?"
12,9,23,"And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah."
12,9,24,"And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and struck Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot."
12,9,25,"Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take him up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;"

12,9,27,"But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Shoot him also in the chariot. And they did so at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there."
12,9,28,"And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the city of David."
12,9,29,"And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah."

12,10,4,"But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?"
12,10,5,"And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the guardians of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are your servants, and will do all that you shall bid us; we will not make any king: do you that which is good in your eyes."
12,10,6,"Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you are mine, and if you will hearken unto my voice, take you the heads of the men, your masterâ€™s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time. Now the kingâ€™s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up."
12,10,7,"And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the kingâ€™s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him at Jezreel."
12,10,8,"And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the kingâ€™s sons. And he said, Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning."
12,10,9,"And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, You are righteous: indeed, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?"
12,10,10,"Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah."
12,10,11,"So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his close associates, and his priests, until he left him none remaining."
12,10,12,"And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way,"
12,10,13,"Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are you? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we are going down to greet the children of the king and the children of the queen."
12,10,14,"And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men: neither left he any of them."
12,10,15,"And when he was departed there, He met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he greeted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot."
12,10,16,"And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they had him ride in his chariot."
12,10,17,"And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed them, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke to Elijah."
12,10,18,"And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much."
12,10,19,"Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be missing: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be missing, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal."
12,10,20,"And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it."
12,10,21,"And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to the other."
12,10,22,"And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments."
12,10,23,"And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only."
12,10,24,"And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men outside, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him."
12,10,25,"And it came to pass, as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they struck them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal."
12,10,26,"And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them."
12,10,27,"And they broke down the image of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a refuse dump unto this day."
12,10,28,"Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel."
12,10,29,"However from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, that is, from the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan."
12,10,30,"And the LORD said unto Jehu,"
12,10,31,"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin."
12,10,32,"In those days the LORD began to cut off parts of Israel: and Hazael defeated them in all the territory of Israel;"
12,10,33,"From the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan."
12,10,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,10,35,"And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead."
12,10,36,"And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years."
12,11,1,"And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs."
12,11,2,"But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the kingâ€™s sons who were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain."
12,11,3,"And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land."
12,11,4,"And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the kingâ€™s son."
12,11,5,"And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that you shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch over the kingâ€™s house;"
12,11,6,"And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall you keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down."
12,11,7,"And two divisions of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king."
12,11,8,"And you shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that comes within the ranks, let him be slain: and be you with the king as he goes out and as he comes in."
12,11,9,"And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest."
12,11,10,"And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king Davidâ€™s spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD."
12,11,11,"And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple."
12,11,12,"And he brought forth the kingâ€™s son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king."
12,11,13,"And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD."
12,11,14,"And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah tore her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason."
12,11,15,"But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the army, and said unto them, Take her forth outside with the ranks: and he that follows her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD."
12,11,16,"And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by which the horses came into the kingâ€™s house: and there was she slain."
12,11,17,"And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORDâ€™S people; between the king also and the people."
12,11,18,"And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and broke it down; its altars and its images broke they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD."
12,11,19,"And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the kingâ€™s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings."
12,11,20,"And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet: because they slew Athaliah with the sword at the kingâ€™s house."
12,11,21,"Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign."
12,12,1,"In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba."
12,12,2,"And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him."
12,12,3,"But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places."
12,12,4,"And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of everyone that is in the census, the money that every man is assessed, and all the money that comes into any manâ€™s heart to bring into the house of the LORD,"
12,12,5,"Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the damages of the house, wherever any damage shall be found."
12,12,6,"But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash, the priests had not repaired the damages of the house."
12,12,7,"Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said unto them, Why repair you not the damages of the house? now therefore take no more money of your acquaintances, but deliver it to repair the damages of the house."
12,12,8,"And the priests consented to take no more money of the people, neither to repair the damages of the house."
12,12,9,"But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put in it all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD."
12,12,10,"And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the kingâ€™s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put it in bags, and counted the money that was found in the house of the LORD."
12,12,11,"And they gave the money, being counted, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they paid it out to the carpenters and builders, that worked upon the house of the LORD,"
12,12,12,"And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the damages of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it."
12,12,13,"However there were not made for the house of the LORD basins of silver, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:"
12,12,14,"But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired with it the house of the LORD."
12,12,15,"Moreover they required no accounting with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be paid to the workmen: for they dealt faithfully."
12,12,16,"The trespass offering money and sin offering money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priestsâ€™."
12,12,17,"Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem."
12,12,18,"And Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own sacred things, and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD, and in the kingâ€™s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem."
12,12,19,"And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,12,20,"And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, on the road which goes down to Silla."
12,12,21,"For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him down, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead."
12,13,1,"In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years."
12,13,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not from there."
12,13,3,"And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all their days."
12,13,4,"And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them."
12,13,5,"(And the LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as before."
12,13,6,"Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked in them: and there remained the idol poles also in Samaria.)"
12,13,7,"Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust at threshing."
12,13,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,13,9,"And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead."
12,13,10,"In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years."
12,13,11,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but he walked in them."
12,13,12,"And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,13,13,"And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel."
12,13,14,"Now Elisha had fallen sick of his sickness of which he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof."
12,13,15,"And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows."
12,13,16,"And he said to the king of Israel, Put your hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the kingâ€™s hands."
12,13,17,"And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORDâ€™S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for you shall smite the Syrians in Aphek, till you have consumed them."
12,13,18,"And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Strike the ground. And he struck three times, and stopped."
12,13,19,"And the man of God was angry with him, and said, You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Syria till you had consumed it: whereas now you shall strike down Syria but three times."
12,13,20,"And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land in the spring of the year."
12,13,21,"And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they saw a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulcher of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet."
12,13,22,"But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz."
12,13,23,"And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet."
12,13,24,"So Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead."
12,13,25,"And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel."
12,14,1,"In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah."
12,14,2,"He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem."
12,14,3,"And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did."
12,14,4,"However the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places."
12,14,5,"And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father."
12,14,6,"But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, in which the LORD commanded, saying,"
12,14,7,"He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day."
12,14,8,"Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face."
12,14,9,"And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle."
12,14,10,"You have indeed struck down Edom, and your heart has lifted you up: glory in this, and tarry at home: for why should you meddle to your harm, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?"
12,14,11,"But Amaziah would not listen. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah."
12,14,12,"And Judah was defeated before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents."
12,14,13,"And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits."
12,14,14,"And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the kingâ€™s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria."
12,14,15,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,14,16,"And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead."
12,14,17,"And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years."
12,14,18,"And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,14,19,"Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there."
12,14,20,"And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David."
12,14,21,"And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah."
12,14,22,"He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers."
12,14,23,"In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years."
12,14,24,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin."
12,14,25,"He restored the border of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was from Gath-hepher."
12,14,26,"For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter: for there was not any, bond nor free left, nor any helper for Israel."
12,14,27,"And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash."
12,14,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he made war, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,14,29,"And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead."
12,15,1,"In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign."
12,15,2,"Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem."
12,15,3,"And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;"
12,15,4,"Except that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places."
12,15,5,"And the LORD struck the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the kingâ€™s son was over the house, judging the people of the land."
12,15,6,"And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,15,7,"So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead."
12,15,8,"In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months."
12,15,9,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin."
12,15,10,"And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck him down before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead."
12,15,11,"And the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
12,15,12,"This was the word of the LORD which he spoke unto Jehu, saying,"
12,15,13,"Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria."
12,15,14,"For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and struck down Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead."
12,15,15,"And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
12,15,16,"Then Menahem attacked Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the territory thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he attacked it; and all the women in it that were with child he ripped up."
12,15,17,"In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and he reigned ten years in Samaria."
12,15,18,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin."
12,15,19,"And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand."
12,15,20,"And Menahem exacted the money from Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land."
12,15,21,"And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
12,15,22,"And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead."
12,15,23,"In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years."
12,15,24,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin."
12,15,25,"But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and struck him down in Samaria, in the palace of the kingâ€™s house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his stead."
12,15,26,"And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel."
12,15,27,"In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years."
12,15,28,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin."
12,15,29,"In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and captured Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria."

12,15,33,"Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok."
12,15,34,"And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done."
12,15,35,"However the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD."
12,15,36,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,15,37,"In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah."
12,15,38,"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead."
12,16,1,"In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign."
12,16,2,"Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father."
12,16,3,"But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel."
12,16,4,"And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree."
12,16,5,"Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him."
12,16,6,"At that time Rezin king of Syria captured Elath for Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day."
12,16,7,"So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me."
12,16,8,"And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the kingâ€™s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria."
12,16,9,"And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin."
12,16,10,"And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof."
12,16,11,"And Uriah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Uriah the priest made it before king Ahaz came from Damascus."
12,16,12,"And when the king had come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon."
12,16,13,"And he burnt his burnt offering and his grain offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar."
12,16,14,"And he brought also the bronze altar, which was before the LORD, from the front of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar."
12,16,15,"And king Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening grain offering, and the kingâ€™s burnt sacrifice, and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their grain offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by."
12,16,16,"Thus did Uriah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded."
12,16,17,"And king Ahaz cut off the panels of the stands, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones."
12,16,18,"And the covered place for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the kingâ€™s outer entry, he removed from the house of the LORD because of the king of Assyria."
12,16,19,"Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,16,20,"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead."
12,17,1,"In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years."
12,17,2,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him."
12,17,3,"Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents."
12,17,4,"And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison."
12,17,5,"Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years."
12,17,6,"In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes."
12,17,7,"For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,"
12,17,8,"And walked in the statutes of the nations, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made."
12,17,9,"And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city."
12,17,10,"And they set them up images and idol poles on every high hill, and under every green tree:"
12,17,11,"And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations which the LORD carried away before them; and did wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:"
12,17,12,"For they served idols, of which the LORD had said unto them,"
12,17,13,"Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying,"
12,17,14,"Nevertheless they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God."
12,17,15,"And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them."
12,17,16,"And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an idol pole and worshiped all the army of heaven, and served Baal."
12,17,17,"And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger."
12,17,18,"Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only."
12,17,19,"Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made."
12,17,20,"And the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of plunderers, until he had cast them out of his sight."
12,17,21,"For he tore Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin."
12,17,22,"For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;"
12,17,23,"Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day."
12,17,24,"And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in its cities."
12,17,25,"And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them."
12,17,26,"Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land."
12,17,27,"Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Send there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land."
12,17,28,"Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the LORD."
12,17,29,"However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they dwelt."
12,17,30,"And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,"
12,17,31,"And the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim."
12,17,32,"So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places."
12,17,33,"They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from there."
12,17,34,"Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they follow their statutes, or their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;"
12,17,35,"With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying,"
12,17,36,""
12,17,37,""
12,17,38,""
12,17,39,""
12,17,40,"However they did not hearken, but they did according to their former manner."
12,17,41,"So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their childrenâ€™s children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day."
12,18,1,"Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign."
12,18,2,"Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah."
12,18,3,"And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did."
12,18,4,"He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the idol poles, and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made: for until those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan."
12,18,5,"He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him."
12,18,6,"For he clung to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses."
12,18,7,"And the LORD was with him; and he prospered wherever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not."
12,18,8,"He struck the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city."
12,18,9,"And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it."
12,18,10,"And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken."
12,18,11,"And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:"
12,18,12,"Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them."
12,18,13,"Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them."
12,18,14,"And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; turn away from me: that which you put on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold."
12,18,15,"And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the kingâ€™s house."
12,18,16,"At that time did Hezekiah strip the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria."
12,18,17,"And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool, which is on the highway of the fullerâ€™s field."
12,18,18,"And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder."
12,18,19,"And Rab-shakeh said unto them, Speak you now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which you trust?"
12,18,20,"You say, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?"
12,18,21,"Now, behold, you trust upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust in him."
12,18,22,"But if you say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?"
12,18,23,"Now therefore, I pray you, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders upon them."
12,18,24,"How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my masterâ€™s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?"
12,18,25,"Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it."
12,18,26,"Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Aramaic language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jewsâ€™ language in the ears of the people that are on the wall."
12,18,27,"But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat and drink their own waste with you?"
12,18,28,"Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewsâ€™ language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:"
12,18,29,"Thus says the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:"
12,18,30,"Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria."
12,18,31,"Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus says the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by paying a tribute, and come out to me, and then eat you every man of his own vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and drink you everyone the waters of his cistern:"
12,18,32,"Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and of honey, that you may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, The LORD will deliver us."
12,18,33,"Has any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?"
12,18,34,"Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?"
12,18,35,"Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?"
12,18,36,"But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the kingâ€™s commandment was, Answer him not."
12,18,37,"Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh."
12,19,1,"And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD."
12,19,2,"And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz."
12,19,3,"And they said unto him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring them forth."
12,19,4,"It may be the LORD your God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD your God has heard: therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that are left."
12,19,5,"So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah."
12,19,6,"And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall you say to your master,"

12,19,8,"So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish."

12,19,10,"Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria."
12,19,11,"Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shall you be delivered?"
12,19,12,"Have the gods of the nations delivered them whom my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telasar?"
12,19,13,"Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?"
12,19,14,"And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD."
12,19,15,"And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, who dwells between the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth."
12,19,16,"LORD, bow down your ear, and hear: open, LORD, your eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, who has sent him to reproach the living God."
12,19,17,"Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,"
12,19,18,"And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of menâ€™s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them."

12,21,26,"And he was buried in his sepulcher in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead."
12,22,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozcath."
12,22,2,"And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left."
12,22,3,"And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,"
12,22,4,"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered from the people:"
12,22,5,"And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work who are in the house of the LORD, to repair the damages of the house,"
12,22,6,"Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house."
12,22,7,"However there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully."
12,22,8,"And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it."
12,22,9,"And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD."
12,22,10,"And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king."
12,22,11,"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes."
12,22,12,"And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the kingâ€™s, saying,"
12,22,13,"Go you, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us."
12,22,14,"So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they talked with her."
12,22,15,"And she said unto them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel,"
12,22,16,""
12,22,17,""
12,22,18,"But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him,"
12,22,19,""
12,22,20,""
12,23,1,"And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem."
12,23,2,"And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD."
12,23,3,"And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people joined in to the covenant."
12,23,4,"And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the idol poles, and for all the army of heaven: and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Beth-el."
12,23,5,"And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the hosts of heaven."
12,23,6,"And he brought out the idol pole from the house of the LORD, outside Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small into powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people."
12,23,7,"And he broke down the houses of the male prostitutes, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the idol pole."
12,23,8,"And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba, and broke down the high places of the gates that were in the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a manâ€™s left hand at the gate of the city."
12,23,9,"Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren."
12,23,10,"And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech."
12,23,11,"And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the court, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire."
12,23,12,"And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king pull down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron."
12,23,13,"And the high places that were east of Jerusalem, which were on the south of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile."
12,23,14,"And he broke in pieces the images, and cut down the idol poles, and filled their places with the bones of men."
12,23,15,"Moreover the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and crushed it to powder, and burned the idol pole."
12,23,16,"And as Josiah turned, he saw the sepulchers that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words."
12,23,17,"Then he said, What gravestone is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulcher of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Beth-el."
12,23,18,"And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria."
12,23,19,"And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el."
12,23,20,"And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned menâ€™s bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem."
12,23,21,"And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant."
12,23,22,"Surely there was not held such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;"
12,23,23,"But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, in which this passover was kept to the LORD in Jerusalem."
12,23,24,"Moreover the workers with mediums, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD."
12,23,25,"And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him."
12,23,26,"Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him."
12,23,27,"And the LORD said,"
12,23,28,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,23,29,"In his days Pharaoh-neco king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him."
12,23,30,"And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his fatherâ€™s stead."
12,23,31,"Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
12,23,32,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done."
12,23,33,"And Pharaoh-neco put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and imposed on the land a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold."
12,23,34,"And Pharaoh-neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name to Johoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there."
12,23,35,"And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, of everyone according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-neco."
12,23,36,"Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah."
12,23,37,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done."
12,24,1,"In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him."
12,24,2,"And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servants the prophets."
12,24,3,"Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;"
12,24,4,"And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon."
12,24,5,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
12,24,6,"So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead."
12,24,7,"And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that belonged to the king of Egypt."
12,24,8,"Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his motherâ€™s name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem."
12,24,9,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done."
12,24,10,"At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged."
12,24,11,"And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it."
12,24,12,"And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign."
12,24,13,"And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the kingâ€™s house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said."
12,24,14,"And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, except the poorest sort of the people of the land."
12,24,15,"And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the kingâ€™s mother, and the kingâ€™s wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon."
12,24,16,"And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon."
12,24,17,"And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his fatherâ€™s brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah."
12,24,18,"Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah."
12,24,19,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done."
12,24,20,"For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon."
12,25,1,"And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built a siege wall against it round about."
12,25,2,"And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah."
12,25,3,"And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no food for the people of the land."
12,25,4,"And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the kingâ€™s garden: (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain."
12,25,5,"And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army was scattered from him."
12,25,6,"So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they pronounced judgment upon him."
12,25,7,"And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of bronze, and carried him to Babylon."
12,25,8,"And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:"
12,25,9,"And he burned the house of the LORD, and the kingâ€™s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great manâ€™s house burned he with fire."
12,25,10,"And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about."
12,25,11,"Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry away."
12,25,12,"But the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and farmers."
12,25,13,"And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands, and the bronze sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried their bronze to Babylon."
12,25,14,"And the pots, and the shovels, and the wick trimmers, and the ladles, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered, they took away."
12,25,15,"And the firepans, and the basins, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away."
12,25,16,"The two pillars, one sea, and the stands which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight."
12,25,17,"The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital upon it was bronze: and the height of the capital three cubits; and the network, and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of bronze: and like unto these the second pillar with a network."
12,25,18,"And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:"
12,25,19,"And out of the city he took an officer that was in charge over the men of war, and five men of them that had been in the kingâ€™s presence, who were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the army, who mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city:"
12,25,20,"And Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:"
12,25,21,"And the king of Babylon struck them down, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land."
12,25,22,"And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor."
12,25,23,"And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maacathite, they and their men."
12,25,24,"And Gedaliah swore to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you."
12,25,25,"But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family, came, and ten men with him, and struck down Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah."
12,25,26,"And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldeans."
12,25,27,"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;"
12,25,28,"And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;"
12,25,29,"And changed his prison garments: and he did eat food regularly before him all the days of his life."
12,25,30,"And his allowance was a regular allowance given him from the king, a daily portion for every day, all the days of his life."

13,10,4,"Then said Saul to his armorbearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not; for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it."
13,10,5,"And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on his sword, and died."
13,10,6,"So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together."
13,10,7,"And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them."
13,10,8,"And it came to pass on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on mount Gilboa."
13,10,9,"And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people."
13,10,10,"And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon."
13,10,11,"And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,"
13,10,12,"They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days."
13,10,13,"So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that was a medium, to seek council;"
13,10,14,"And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse."
13,11,1,"Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh."
13,11,2,"And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD your God said unto you,"
13,11,3,"Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel."
13,11,4,"And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land."
13,11,5,"And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come here. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David."
13,11,6,"And David said, Whosoever smites the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief."
13,11,7,"And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of David."
13,11,8,"And he built the city around it, even from Millo and around: and Joab repaired the rest of the city."
13,11,9,"So David grew greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him."
13,11,10,"These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel."
13,11,11,"And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time."
13,11,12,"And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men."
13,11,13,"He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines."
13,11,14,"And they set themselves in the midst of that plot, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance."
13,11,15,"Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim."
13,11,16,"And David was then in the stronghold, and the Philistinesâ€™ garrison was then at Bethlehem."
13,11,17,"And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me a drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!"
13,11,18,"And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD,"
13,11,19,"And said, My God forbid me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men."
13,11,20,"And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three."
13,11,21,"Of the three, he was more honorable than the two; for he was their captain: however he attained not to the first three."
13,11,22,"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many great deeds; he slew two lion-like men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit on a snowy day."
13,11,23,"And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall; and in the Egyptianâ€™s hand was a spear like a weaverâ€™s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptianâ€™s hand, and slew him with his own spear."
13,11,24,"These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and won a name among the three mighty men."
13,11,25,"Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard."

13,12,16,"And there came from the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold unto David."
13,12,17,"And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If you are come peaceably unto me to help me, my heart shall be knit unto you: but if you are come to betray me to my enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look on it, and rebuke it."
13,12,18,"Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Yours we are, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you. Then David received them, and made them captains of his troop."
13,12,19,"And there deserted some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines after counsel sent him away, saying, He will desert to his master Saul to the peril of our heads."
13,12,20,"As he went to Ziklag, there deserted to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zellethai, captains of the thousands that were from Manasseh."
13,12,21,"And they helped David against the band of raiders: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the army."
13,12,22,"For at that time day by day there came more to David to help him, until it was a great army, like the army of God."
13,12,23,"And these are the numbers of the men that were ready armed for war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD."
13,12,24,"The children of Judah that bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed for war."
13,12,25,"Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for war, seven thousand and one hundred."
13,12,26,"Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred."
13,12,27,"And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred;"
13,12,28,"And Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his fatherâ€™s house twenty and two captains."
13,12,29,"And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for until now the greatest part of them had remained loyal to the house of Saul."
13,12,30,"And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men throughout the house of their fathers."
13,12,31,"And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were designated by name, to come and make David king."
13,12,32,"And of the children of Issachar, who were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were under their command."
13,12,33,"Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, who could keep ranks: they had singleness of heart."
13,12,34,"And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand."
13,12,35,"And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred."
13,12,36,"And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand."
13,12,37,"And on the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for battle, a hundred and twenty thousand."
13,12,38,"All these men of war, that could keep ranks, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king."
13,12,39,"And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them."
13,12,40,"Moreover they that were near them, even from Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought food on donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and supplies of meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel."
13,13,1,"And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader."
13,13,2,"And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seems good unto you, and that it is of the LORD our God, let us send out unto our brethren everywhere, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites who are in their cities and pasture lands, that they may gather themselves unto us:"
13,13,3,"And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we have not inquired at it in the days of Saul."
13,13,4,"And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people."
13,13,5,"So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim."
13,13,6,"And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who dwells between the cherubim, whose name is proclaimed there."
13,13,7,"And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzzah and Ahio drove the cart."
13,13,8,"And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with lyres, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets."
13,13,9,"And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzzah put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled."
13,13,10,"And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and he struck him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God."
13,13,11,"And David was displeased, because the LORD had broken forth upon Uzzah: therefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day."
13,13,12,"And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?"
13,13,13,"So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite."
13,13,14,"And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had."
13,14,1,"Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house."
13,14,2,"And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel."
13,14,3,"And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters."
13,14,4,"Now these are the names of his children whom he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,"
13,14,5,"And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,"
13,14,6,"And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,"
13,14,7,"And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet."
13,14,8,"And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them."
13,14,9,"And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim."
13,14,10,"And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and will you deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said unto him,"
13,14,11,"So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David defeated them there. Then David said, God has broken in upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim."
13,14,12,"And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire."
13,14,13,"And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley."
13,14,14,"Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him,"
13,14,15,""
13,14,16,"David therefore did as God commanded him: and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer."
13,14,17,"And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations."
13,15,1,"And David made himself houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent."
13,15,2,"Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them has the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him forever."
13,15,3,"And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto its place, which he had prepared for it."
13,15,4,"And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:"
13,15,5,"Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty:"
13,15,6,"Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:"
13,15,7,"Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty:"
13,15,8,"Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:"
13,15,9,"Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:"
13,15,10,"Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve."
13,15,11,"And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,"
13,15,12,"And said unto them, You are the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of the Levites: Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it."
13,15,13,"For because you did it not at the first, the LORD our God broke forth upon us, for we sought him not about the proper order."
13,15,14,"So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel."
13,15,15,"And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the its poles, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD."
13,15,16,"And David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of music, lyres and harps and cymbals sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy."
13,15,17,"So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;"
13,15,18,"And with them their brethren of the second order, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers."
13,15,19,"So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of bronze;"
13,15,20,"And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with harps according to Alamoth;"
13,15,21,"And Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with lyres according to the Sheminith, to lead."
13,15,22,"And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, in music: he instructed about the music, because he was skillful."
13,15,23,"And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark."
13,15,24,"And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark."
13,15,25,"So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy."
13,15,26,"And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams."
13,15,27,"And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the leader of the music with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen."
13,15,28,"Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making music with lyres and harps."
13,15,29,"And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart."
13,16,1,"So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God."
13,16,2,"And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD."
13,16,3,"And he gave to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins."
13,16,4,"And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to invoke, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:"
13,16,5,"Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with lyres and with harps; but Asaph made music with cymbals;"
13,16,6,"Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests blew trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God."
13,16,7,"Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren."
13,16,8,"Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people."
13,16,9,"Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk you of all his wondrous works."
13,16,10,"Glory you in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD."
13,16,11,"Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually."
13,16,12,"Remember his marvelous works that he has done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;"
13,16,13,"O you descendants of Israel his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen ones."
13,16,14,"He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth."
13,16,15,"Be you mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;"
13,16,16,"Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;"
13,16,17,"And has confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,"
13,16,18,"Saying, Unto you will I give the land of Canaan, the portion of your inheritance;"
13,16,19,"When you were but few, even a few, and strangers in it."
13,16,20,"And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;"
13,16,21,"He allowed no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,"
13,16,22,"Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm."
13,16,23,"Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; show forth from day to day his salvation."
13,16,24,"Declare his glory among the nations; his marvelous works among all peoples."
13,16,25,"For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods."
13,16,26,"For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens."
13,16,27,"Glory and honor are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place."
13,16,28,"Give unto the LORD, you families of the peoples, give unto the LORD glory and strength."
13,16,29,"Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness."
13,16,30,"Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved."
13,16,31,"Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigns."
13,16,32,"Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein."
13,16,33,"Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he comes to judge the earth."
13,16,34,"O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endures forever."
13,16,35,"And say, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name, and glory in your praise."
13,16,36,"Blessed be the LORD God of Israel forever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD."
13,16,37,"So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every dayâ€™s work required:"
13,16,38,"And Obed-edom with his brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be gatekeepers:"
13,16,39,"And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,"
13,16,40,"To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;"
13,16,41,"And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endures forever;"
13,16,42,"And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were gatekeepers."
13,16,43,"And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house."
13,17,1,"Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remains under curtains."
13,17,2,"Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you."
13,17,3,"And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,"
13,17,4,""
13,17,5,""
13,17,6,""
13,17,7,""
13,17,8,""
13,17,9,""
13,17,10,""
13,17,11,""
13,17,12,""
13,17,13,""
13,17,14,""
13,17,15,"According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David."
13,17,16,"And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that you have brought me this far?"
13,17,17,"And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O God; for you have also spoken of your servantâ€™s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God."
13,17,18,"What can David speak more to you for the honor of your servant? for you know your servant."
13,17,19,"O LORD, for your servantâ€™s sake, and according to your own heart, have you done all this greatness, in making known all these great things."
13,17,20,"O LORD, there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears."
13,17,21,"And what one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make you a name of greatness and awesomeness, by driving out nations from before your people, whom you have redeemed out of Egypt?"
13,17,22,"For your people Israel did you make your own people forever; and you, LORD, became their God."
13,17,23,"Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as you have said."
13,17,24,"Let it even be established, that your name may be magnified forever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David your servant be established before you."
13,17,25,"For you, O my God, have told your servant that you will build him a house: therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray before you."
13,17,26,"And now, LORD, you are God, and have promised this goodness unto your servant:"
13,17,27,"Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may be before you forever: for you bless, O LORD, and it shall be blessed forever."
13,18,1,"Now after this it came to pass, that David defeated the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines."
13,18,2,"And he defeated Moab; and the Moabites became Davidâ€™s servants, and brought tribute."
13,18,3,"And David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to establish his rule by the river Euphrates."
13,18,4,"And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them a hundred chariots."
13,18,5,"And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men."
13,18,6,"Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became Davidâ€™s servants, and brought tribute. Thus the LORD preserved David wherever he went."
13,18,7,"And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem."
13,18,8,"Likewise from Tibhath, and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, brought David very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of bronze."
13,18,9,"Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah;"
13,18,10,"He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and defeated him; (for Hadadezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and bronze."
13,18,11,"Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek."
13,18,12,"Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand."
13,18,13,"And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became Davidâ€™s servants. Thus the LORD preserved David wherever he went."
13,18,14,"So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people."
13,18,15,"And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder."
13,18,16,"And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;"
13,18,17,"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief officials at the kingâ€™s side."
13,19,1,"Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead."
13,19,2,"And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him."
13,19,3,"But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Think you that David does honor your father, that he has sent comforters unto you? are not his servants come unto you to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?"
13,19,4,"Therefore Hanun took Davidâ€™s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them away."
13,19,5,"Then there went certain, and told David how the men were treated. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Remain at Jericho until your beards are grown, and then return."
13,19,6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire themselves chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Aram-maachah, and out of Zobah."
13,19,7,"So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle."
13,19,8,"And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men."
13,19,9,"And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that had come were by themselves in the field."
13,19,10,"Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians."
13,19,11,"And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon."
13,19,12,"And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me: but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you."
13,19,13,"Be of good courage, and let us fight valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight."
13,19,14,"So Joab and the people that were with him drew near before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him."
13,19,15,"And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem."
13,19,16,"And when the Syrians saw that they were defeated before Israel, they sent messengers, and brought forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer went before them."
13,19,17,"And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him."
13,19,18,"But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men who fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army."
13,19,19,"And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more."
13,20,1,"And it came to pass, that after the year was ended, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the strength of the army, and ravaged the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. And Joab defeated Rabbah, and destroyed it."
13,20,2,"And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon Davidâ€™s head: and he brought also a great amount of spoil out of the city."
13,20,3,"And he brought out the people that were in it, and put them to work with saws, and with picks of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem."
13,20,4,"And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued."
13,20,5,"And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spearâ€™s shaft was like a weaverâ€™s beam."
13,20,6,"And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant."
13,20,7,"But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea Davidâ€™s brother slew him."
13,20,8,"These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants."
13,21,1,"And Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to number Israel."
13,21,2,"And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it."
13,21,3,"And Joab answered, The LORD make his people a hundred times so many more as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lordâ€™s servants? why then does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?"
13,21,4,"Nevertheless the kingâ€™s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem."
13,21,5,"And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword."
13,21,6,"But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the kingâ€™s command was abominable to Joab."
13,21,7,"And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel."
13,21,8,"And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech you, take away the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly."
13,21,9,"And the LORD spoke unto Gad, Davidâ€™s seer, saying,"
13,21,10,""
13,21,11,"So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus says the LORD,"
13,21,12,""
13,21,13,"And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man."
13,21,14,"So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men."
13,21,15,"And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the angel that destroyed,"
13,21,16,"And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces."
13,21,17,"And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let your hand, I pray you, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my fatherâ€™s house; but not on your people, that they should be plagued."
13,21,18,"Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite."
13,21,19,"And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD."
13,21,20,"And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat."
13,21,21,"And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground."
13,21,22,"Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar on it unto the LORD: you shall give it to me for the full price: that the plague may be averted from the people."
13,21,23,"And Ornan said unto David, Take it to yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give you the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering; I give it all."
13,21,24,"And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will indeed buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is yours for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost."
13,21,25,"So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight."
13,21,26,"And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering."
13,21,27,"And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath."
13,21,28,"At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there."
13,21,29,"For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon."
13,21,30,"But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD."
13,22,1,"Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel."
13,22,2,"And David commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut hewn stones to build the house of God."
13,22,3,"And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the fittings; and bronze in abundance without weight;"
13,22,4,"Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David."
13,22,5,"And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death."
13,22,6,"Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel."
13,22,7,"And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the LORD my God:"
13,22,8,"But the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
13,22,9,""
13,22,10,""
13,22,11,"Now, my son, the LORD be with you; and prosper you, and build the house of the LORD your God, as he has said of you."
13,22,12,"Only the LORD give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel, that you may keep the law of the LORD your God."
13,22,13,"Then shall you prosper, if you take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed."
13,22,14,"Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of bronze and iron beyond weighing; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and you may add to it."
13,22,15,"Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skillful men for every manner of work."
13,22,16,"Of the gold, the silver, and the bronze, and the iron, there is no limit. Arise therefore, and begin working, and the LORD be with you."
13,22,17,"David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,"
13,22,18,"Is not the LORD your God with you? and has he not given you rest on every side? for he has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people."
13,22,19,"Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build you the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD."
13,23,1,"So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel."
13,23,2,"And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites."
13,23,3,"Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand."
13,23,4,"Of which, twenty and four thousand were to look after the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:"
13,23,5,"Moreover four thousand were gatekeepers; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, for praise."
13,23,6,"And David divided them into divisions among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
13,23,7,"Of the Gershonites were, Ladan, and Shimei."
13,23,8,"The sons of Ladan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three."
13,23,9,"The sons of Shimei; Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of Ladan."
13,23,10,"And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei."
13,23,11,"And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, as one fatherâ€™s house."
13,23,12,"The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four."
13,23,13,"The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to give the blessing in his name forever."
13,23,14,"Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi."
13,23,15,"The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer."
13,23,16,"Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief."
13,23,17,"And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many."
13,23,18,"Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief."
13,23,19,"Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth."
13,23,20,"Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first, and Issiah the second."
13,23,21,"The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish."
13,23,22,"And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them."
13,23,23,"The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three."
13,23,24,"These were the sons of Levi by their fathersâ€™ houses; even the heads of their fathersâ€™ houses, as they were counted individually by the number of their names, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward."
13,23,25,"For David said, The LORD God of Israel has given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem forever:"
13,23,26,"And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof."
13,23,27,"For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:"
13,23,28,"Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;"
13,23,29,"Both for the showbread, and for the fine flour for meal offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is mixed with all kinds of measures and sizes;"
13,23,30,"And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at evening;"
13,23,31,"And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to that required of them, continually before the LORD:"
13,23,32,"And that they should attend to the needs of the tabernacle of meeting, and the needs of the holy place, and the needs of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD."
13,24,1,"Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
13,24,2,"But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priestâ€™s office."
13,24,3,"And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service."
13,24,4,"And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen heads of their fathersâ€™ houses, and eight heads of their fathersâ€™ houses among the sons of Ithamar."
13,24,5,"Thus were they divided by lot, one group as another; for the officials of the sanctuary, and officials of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar."
13,24,6,"And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them down before the king, and the leaders, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of the priests and Levites: one fatherâ€™s house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar."
13,24,7,"Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,"
13,24,8,"The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,"
13,24,9,"The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,"
13,24,10,"The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,"
13,24,11,"The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah,"
13,24,12,"The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,"
13,24,13,"The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,"
13,24,14,"The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,"
13,24,15,"The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,"
13,24,16,"The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,"
13,24,17,"The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,"
13,24,18,"The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah."
13,24,19,"This was the schedule of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their procedure established under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him."
13,24,20,"And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah."
13,24,21,"Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah."
13,24,22,"Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath."
13,24,23,"And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth."
13,24,24,"Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah: of the sons of Micah; Shamir."
13,24,25,"The brother of Micah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah."
13,24,26,"The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno."
13,24,27,"The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri."
13,24,28,"Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons."
13,24,29,"Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel."
13,24,30,"The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to the house of their fathers."
13,24,31,"These likewise cast lots even as their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of the priests and Levites; the principal fathers did even as their younger brethren."
13,25,1,"Moreover David and the captains of the army separated for the service some of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with lyres, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:"
13,25,2,"Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied according to the order of the king."
13,25,3,"Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Shemei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD."
13,25,4,"Of Heman: the sons of Heman; Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth:"
13,25,5,"All these were the sons of Heman the kingâ€™s seer in the words of God, to exalt the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters."
13,25,6,"All these were under the direction of their father in the music in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, lyres, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the kingâ€™s order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman."
13,25,7,"So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were skillful, was two hundred fourscore and eight."
13,25,8,"And they cast lots for their duties, the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the student."
13,25,9,"Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve:"
13,25,10,"The third to Zaccur, his sons, and his brethren, twelve:"

13,26,8,"All these of the sons of Obed-edom: they and their sons and their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were threescore and two of Obed-edom."
13,26,9,"And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen."
13,26,10,"Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Shimri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;)"

13,26,12,"Among these were the divisions of the gatekeepers, even among the chief men, having duties like one another, to minister in the house of the LORD."
13,26,13,"And they cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate."
13,26,14,"And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward."
13,26,15,"To Obed-edom southward; and to his sons the storehouse."
13,26,16,"To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the road that goes up, watch opposite watch."

13,27,23,"But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the heavens."
13,27,24,"Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David."
13,27,25,"And over the kingâ€™s treasuries was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the towers, was Jonathan the son of Uzziah:"
13,27,26,"And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:"
13,27,27,"And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the produce of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:"
13,27,28,"And over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in the lowlands was Baal-hanan the Gederite: and over the stores of oil was Joash:"
13,27,29,"And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai:"
13,27,30,"Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:"
13,27,31,"And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite. All these were the officials over the property of king David."
13,27,32,"Also Jonathan Davidâ€™s uncle was a counselor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the kingâ€™s sons:"
13,27,33,"And Ahithophel was the kingâ€™s counselor: and Hushai the Archite was the kingâ€™s companion:"
13,27,34,"And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the kingâ€™s army was Joab."
13,28,1,"And David assembled all the leaders of Israel, the leaders of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by division, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possessions of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem."
13,28,2,"Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:"
13,28,3,"But God said unto me,"
13,28,4,"However the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever: for he has chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel:"
13,28,5,"And of all my sons, (for the LORD has given me many sons,) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel."
13,28,6,"And he said unto me,"
13,28,7,""
13,28,8,"Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you forever."
13,28,9,"And you, Solomon my son, know you the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts: if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever."
13,28,10,"Take heed now; for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it."
13,28,11,"Then David gave to Solomon his son the plans of the vestibule, and of its houses, and of its treasuries, and of its upper chambers, and of its inner chambers, and of the place for the mercy seat,"
13,28,12,"And the plans for all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:"
13,28,13,"Also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD."
13,28,14,"He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all articles of all manner of service; silver also for all articles of silver by weight, for all articles of every kind of service:"
13,28,15,"Even the weight for the lampstands of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every lampstand, and for the lamps thereof: and for the lampstands of silver by weight, both for the lampstand, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every lampstand."
13,28,16,"And by weight he gave gold for the tables of showbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:"
13,28,17,"Also pure gold for the forks, and the basins, and the cups: and for the golden bowls he gave gold by weight for every bowl; and likewise silver by weight for every bowl of silver:"
13,28,18,"And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the plan of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD."
13,28,19,"All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this plan."
13,28,20,"And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD."
13,28,21,"And, behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with you for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with you for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the leaders and all the people will be wholly at your command."
13,29,1,"Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God."
13,29,2,"Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the bronze for things of bronze, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistening stones, and of various colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance."
13,29,3,"Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, I have of my own things, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,"
13,29,4,"Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses:"
13,29,5,"The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of craftsmen. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?"
13,29,6,"Then the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses and the leaders of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the officers over the kingâ€™s work, offered willingly,"
13,29,7,"And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of bronze eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron."
13,29,8,"And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite."
13,29,9,"Then the people rejoiced, for they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy."
13,29,10,"Therefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be you, LORD God of Israel our father, forever and ever."
13,29,11,"Yours, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is yours; yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all."
13,29,12,"Both riches and honor come from you, and you reign over all; and in your hand is power and might; and in your hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all."
13,29,13,"Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name."
13,29,14,"But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? for all things come from you, and of your own have we given you."
13,29,15,"For we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding."
13,29,16,"O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is all your own."
13,29,17,"I know also, my God, that you test the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy your people, who are present here, to offer willingly unto you."
13,29,18,"O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and direct their heart unto you:"
13,29,19,"And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision."
13,29,20,"And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshiped the LORD, and the king."
13,29,21,"And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the next day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:"
13,29,22,"And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the prince, and Zadok to be priest."
13,29,23,"Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him."
13,29,24,"And all the leaders, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king."
13,29,25,"And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel."
13,29,26,"Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel."
13,29,27,"And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem."
13,29,28,"And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead."
13,29,29,"Now the acts of David the king, from first to last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,"
13,29,30,"With all his reign and his might, and the events that happened to him, and to Israel, and to all the kingdoms of the countries."
14,1,1,"And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly."
14,1,2,"Then Solomon spoke unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses."
14,1,3,"So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness."
14,1,4,"But the ark of God had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem."
14,1,5,"Moreover the bronze altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought the LORD there."
14,1,6,"And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it."
14,1,7,"In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him,"
14,1,8,"And Solomon said unto God, You have shown great mercy unto David my father, and have made me to reign in his stead."
14,1,9,"Now, O LORD God, let your promise unto David my father be established: for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude."
14,1,10,"Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this your people, that are so great?"
14,1,11,"And God said to Solomon,"
14,1,12,""
14,1,13,"Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of meeting, and reigned over Israel."
14,1,14,"And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
14,1,15,"And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plentiful as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland for abundance."
14,1,16,"And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and Kue: the kingâ€™s merchants received them from Kue at a price."
14,1,17,"And they acquired and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by the merchants."
14,2,1,"And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the LORD, and a house for his kingdom."
14,2,2,"And Solomon selected threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to quarry in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them."
14,2,3,"And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As you did deal with David my father, and did send him cedars to build him a house to dwell in, even so deal with me."
14,2,4,"Behold, I build a house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel."
14,2,5,"And the house which I build will be great: for great is our God above all gods."
14,2,6,"But who is able to build him a house, seeing the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him a house, except only to burn sacrifices before him?"
14,2,7,"Send me now therefore a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that has skill to engrave with the skillful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide."
14,2,8,"Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that your servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants,"
14,2,9,"Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderfully great."
14,2,10,"And, behold, I will give to your servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand cors of ground wheat, and twenty thousand cors of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil."
14,2,11,"Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD has loved his people, he has made you king over them."
14,2,12,"Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build a house for the LORD, and a house for his kingdom."
14,2,13,"And now I have sent a skillful man, endued with understanding, Huramabi,"
14,2,14,"The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, and in wood, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to engrave any manner of engraving, and to execute every design which shall be given to him, with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father."
14,2,15,"Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send unto his servants:"
14,2,16,"And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need: and we will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem."
14,2,17,"And Solomon numbered all the sojourners that were in the land of Israel, according to the census by which David his father had numbered them; and there were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred."
14,2,18,"And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to quarry in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to make the people work."
14,3,1,"Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite."
14,3,2,"And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign."
14,3,3,"Now these are the things in which Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits according to the old cubit was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits."
14,3,4,"And the vestibule that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was a hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it inside with pure gold."
14,3,5,"And the greater room he lined with fir wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains."
14,3,6,"And he adorned the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim."
14,3,7,"He lined also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and carved cherubim on the walls."
14,3,8,"And he made the most holy place, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents."
14,3,9,"And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold."
14,3,10,"And in the most holy place he made two cherubim of wood, and overlaid them with gold."
14,3,11,"And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub."
14,3,12,"And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub."
14,3,13,"The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and they faced inward."
14,3,14,"And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wove cherubim into it."
14,3,15,"Also he made in front of the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits."
14,3,16,"And he made chains, as in the inner sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains."
14,3,17,"And he raised up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz."
14,4,1,"Moreover he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height."
14,4,2,"Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in shape, and five cubits its height; and a line of thirty cubits did measure its circumference."
14,4,3,"And under it was the likeness of oxen, which did circle it round about: ten to a cubit, circling the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast."
14,4,4,"It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set upon them, and all their hind parts were inward."
14,4,5,"And the thickness of it was a handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; and it received and held three thousand baths."
14,4,6,"He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in."
14,4,7,"And he made ten lampstands of gold according to their design, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left."
14,4,8,"He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold."
14,4,9,"Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with bronze."
14,4,10,"And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, toward the south."
14,4,11,"And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;"
14,4,12,"The two pillars, and the bowls, and the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;"
14,4,13,"And four hundred pomegranates on the two networks; two rows of pomegranates on each net, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were upon the pillars."
14,4,14,"He made also stands, and lavers made he upon the stands;"
14,4,15,"One sea, and twelve oxen under it."
14,4,16,"The pots also, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their articles, did Huram his father make for king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright bronze."
14,4,17,"In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredath."
14,4,18,"Thus Solomon made all these articles in great abundance: for the weight of the bronze could not be measured."
14,4,19,"And Solomon made all the articles that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables on which the showbread was set;"
14,4,20,"Moreover the lampstands with their lamps, that they should burn in the prescribed manner before the inner sanctuary, of pure gold;"
14,4,21,"And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, the purest gold;"
14,4,22,"And the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entrance of the house, the inner doors for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold."
14,5,1,"Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the furnishings, put he in the treasuries of the house of God."
14,5,2,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion."
14,5,3,"Therefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month."
14,5,4,"And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark."
14,5,5,"And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up."
14,5,6,"Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be counted nor numbered for multitude."
14,5,7,"And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto its place, to the inner sanctuary of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim:"
14,5,8,"For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles."
14,5,9,"And the poles of the ark extended out, so that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark in front of the inner sanctuary; but they were not seen outside. And there it is unto this day."
14,5,10,"There was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt."
14,5,11,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, without regard to their divisions."
14,5,12,"Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and lyres and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)"
14,5,13,"It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures forever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;"
14,5,14,"So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God."
14,6,1,"Then said Solomon, The LORD has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness."
14,6,2,"But I have built a house of habitation for you, and a place for your dwelling forever."
14,6,3,"And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood."
14,6,4,"And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who has with his hands fulfilled that which he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying,"
14,6,5,""
14,6,6,""
14,6,7,"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel."
14,6,8,"But the LORD said to David my father,"
14,6,9,""
14,6,10,"The LORD therefore has performed his word that he has spoken: for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel."
14,6,11,"And in it have I put the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel."
14,6,12,"And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:"
14,6,13,"For Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, and five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven,"
14,6,14,"And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like you in the heaven, nor in the earth; who keeps covenant, and shows mercy unto your servants, that walk before you with all their hearts:"
14,6,15,"You who have kept with your servant David my father that which you have promised him; and spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day."
14,6,16,"Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying,"
14,6,17,"Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you have spoken unto your servant David."
14,6,18,"But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you; how much less this house which I have built!"
14,6,19,"Have respect therefore to the prayer of your servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which your servant prays before you:"
14,6,20,"That your eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place of which you have said that you would put your name there; to hearken unto the prayer which your servant prays toward this place."
14,6,21,"Hearken therefore unto the supplications of your servant, and of your people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear you from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive."
14,6,22,"If a man sins against his neighbor, and is made to take an oath, and the oath is made before your altar in this house;"
14,6,23,"Then hear from heaven, and act, and judge your servants, by requiting the wicked, by bringing his conduct upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving to him according to his righteousness."
14,6,24,"And if your people Israel are defeated before the enemy, because they have sinned against you; and shall return and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house;"
14,6,25,"Then hear from the heavens, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which you gave to them and to their fathers."
14,6,26,"When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you do afflict them;"
14,6,27,"Then hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you have taught them the good way, in which they should walk; and send rain upon your land, which you have given unto your people for an inheritance."
14,6,28,"If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever plague or whatsoever sickness there is:"
14,6,29,"Then whatsoever prayer or whatsoever supplication shall be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, when each one shall know his own affliction and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:"
14,6,30,"Then hear from heaven your dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you alone know the hearts of the children of men:)"
14,6,31,"That they may fear you, to walk in your ways, as long as they live in the land which you gave unto our fathers."
14,6,32,"Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, but has come from a far country for your great nameâ€™s sake, and your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm; if they come and pray in this house;"
14,6,33,"Then hear from the heavens, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all people of the earth may know your name, and fear you, as does your people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by your name."
14,6,34,"If your people go out to war against their enemies by the way that you shall send them, and they pray unto you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name;"
14,6,35,"Then hear from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause."
14,6,36,"If they sin against you, (for there is no man who sins not,) and you are angry with them, and deliver them over to their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far or near;"
14,6,37,"Yet if they come to themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto you in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done wrong, and have dealt wickedly;"
14,6,38,"If they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which you gave unto their fathers, and toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name:"
14,6,39,"Then hear from the heavens, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you."
14,6,40,"Now, my God, let, I beseech you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive unto the prayer that is made in this place."
14,6,41,"Now therefore arise, O LORD God, to your resting place, you, and the ark of your strength: let your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in goodness."
14,6,42,"O LORD God, turn not away the face of your anointed: remember the mercies of David your servant."
14,7,1,"Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house."
14,7,2,"And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORDâ€™S house."
14,7,3,"And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshiped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures forever."
14,7,4,"Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD."
14,7,5,"And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God."
14,7,6,"And the priests stood at their posts: the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endures forever, whenever David offered praise by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets opposite them, and all Israel stood."
14,7,7,"Moreover Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the grain offerings, and the fat."
14,7,8,"Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath unto the river of Egypt."
14,7,9,"And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they observed the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days."
14,7,10,"And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shown unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people."
14,7,11,"Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the kingâ€™s house: and all that came into Solomonâ€™s heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he successfully accomplished."
14,7,12,"And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him,"

14,8,1,"And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,"
14,8,2,"That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon rebuilt them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there."
14,8,3,"And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it."
14,8,4,"And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built in Hamath."
14,8,5,"Also he built upper Beth-horon, and lower Beth-horon, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;"
14,8,6,"And Baalath, and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities for the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion."
14,8,7,"As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,"
14,8,8,"But of their descendants, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon put to forced labor until this day."
14,8,9,"But of the children of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen."
14,8,10,"And these were the chief of king Solomonâ€™s officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bore rule over the people."
14,8,11,"And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, to which the ark of the LORD has come."
14,8,12,"Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the vestibule,"
14,8,13,"Even according to a certain duty every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles."
14,8,14,"And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and serve before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the gatekeepers also by their divisions at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded."
14,8,15,"And they departed not from the command of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasuries."
14,8,16,"Now all the work of Solomon was accomplished unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed."
14,8,17,"Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom."
14,8,18,"And Huram sent him ships by the hands of his servants, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon."
14,9,1,"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to test Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she had come to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was in her heart."
14,9,2,"And Solomon answered her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he answered her not."
14,9,3,"And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,"
14,9,4,"And the food of his table, and the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his entryway by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her."
14,9,5,"And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom:"
14,9,6,"However I believed not their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me: for you exceed the fame that I heard."
14,9,7,"Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom."
14,9,8,"Blessed be the LORD your God, who delighted in you to set you on his throne, to be king for the LORD your God: because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore he made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness."
14,9,9,"And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither were there any such spices as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon."
14,9,10,"And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones."
14,9,11,"And the king made of the algum wood steps to the house of the LORD, and to the kingâ€™s palace, and harps and lyres for the singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah."
14,9,12,"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, more than that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants."
14,9,13,"Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;"
14,9,14,"Besides that which traders and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon."
14,9,15,"And king Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold: six hundred shekels of hammered gold went to each large shield."
14,9,16,"And three hundred shields made he of hammered gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon."
14,9,17,"Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold."
14,9,18,"And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and arm rests on each side of the seat, and two lions standing by the arm rests:"
14,9,19,"And twelve lions stood there, one on each side upon the six steps. There was not the like of which made in any kingdom."
14,9,20,"And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; for it was not counted as anything in the days of Solomon."
14,9,21,"For the kingâ€™s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: once every three years came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks."
14,9,22,"And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom."
14,9,23,"And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart."
14,9,24,"And they brought every man his present, articles of silver, and articles of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a set rate year by year."
14,9,25,"And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he stationed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem."
14,9,26,"And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt."
14,9,27,"And the king made silver in Jerusalem as common as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that are in the low plains in abundance."
14,9,28,"And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands."
14,9,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?"
14,9,30,"And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years."
14,9,31,"And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead."
14,10,1,"And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem had all Israel come to make him king."
14,10,2,"And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt."
14,10,3,"And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,"
14,10,4,"Your father made our yoke heavy: now therefore ease you somewhat the heavy service of your father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve you."
14,10,5,"And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed."
14,10,6,"And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel do you give me to return an answer to this people?"
14,10,7,"And they spoke unto him, saying, If you are kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever."
14,10,8,"But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him."
14,10,9,"And he said unto them, What advice do you give that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that your father did put upon us?"
14,10,10,"And the young men that were brought up with him spoke unto him, saying, Thus shall you answer the people that spoke unto you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it somewhat lighter for us; thus shall you say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my fatherâ€™s waist."
14,10,11,"For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will add more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."
14,10,12,"So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had asked, saying, Come again to me on the third day."
14,10,13,"And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,"
14,10,14,"And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."
14,10,15,"So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the turn of events was from God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat."
14,10,16,"And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to your own house. So all Israel went to their tents."
14,10,17,"But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them."
14,10,18,"Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram who was over the forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, so that he died. But king Rehoboam made haste to get himself up into his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem."
14,10,19,"And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day."
14,11,1,"And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam."
14,11,2,"But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
14,11,3,""
14,11,4,""
14,11,5,"And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah."
14,11,6,"He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,"
14,11,7,"And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,"
14,11,8,"And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,"
14,11,9,"And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,"
14,11,10,"And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities."
14,11,11,"And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and store of food, and of oil and wine."
14,11,12,"And in every city he put shields and spears, and made them very strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side."
14,11,13,"And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their territories."
14,11,14,"For the Levites left their pastures lands and their possessions, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from executing the priestâ€™s office unto the LORD:"
14,11,15,"And he ordained himself priests for the high places, and for the goat idols, and for the calf idols which he had made."
14,11,16,"And after that, out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers."
14,11,17,"So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon."
14,11,18,"And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David as his wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;"
14,11,19,"Who bore him children; Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham."
14,11,20,"And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; who bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith."
14,11,21,"And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)"
14,11,22,"And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king."
14,11,23,"And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fortified city: and he gave them provisions in abundance. And he procured many wives for them."
14,12,1,"And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him."
14,12,2,"And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,"
14,12,3,"With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Libyans, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians."
14,12,4,"And he took the fortified cities which belonged to Judah, and came to Jerusalem."
14,12,5,"Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus says the LORD,"
14,12,6,"Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous."
14,12,7,"And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying,"
14,12,8,""
14,12,9,"So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the kingâ€™s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made."
14,12,10,"In place of them king Rehoboam made shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, that kept the entrance of the kingâ€™s house."
14,12,11,"And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and bore them, and brought them again into the guard chamber."
14,12,12,"And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well."
14,12,13,"So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his motherâ€™s name was Naamah an Ammonitess."
14,12,14,"And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD."
14,12,15,"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually."
14,12,16,"And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead."
14,13,1,"Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah."
14,13,2,"He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s name also was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam."
14,13,3,"And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valor."
14,13,4,"And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the mountains of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, you Jeroboam, and all Israel;"
14,13,5,"Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?"
14,13,6,"Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, has risen up, and has rebelled against his lord."
14,13,7,"And there are gathered unto him worthless men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them."
14,13,8,"And now do you think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods."
14,13,9,"Have you not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made yourselves priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods."
14,13,10,"But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, who minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites attend to their service:"
14,13,11,"And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the showbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the lampstand of gold with its lamps, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but you have forsaken him."
14,13,12,"And, behold, God himself is with us as our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight not against the LORD God of your fathers; for you shall not prosper."
14,13,13,"But Jeroboam sent an ambush to come around behind them: so they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them."
14,13,14,"And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets."
14,13,15,"Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah."
14,13,16,"And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand."
14,13,17,"And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men."
14,13,18,"Thus the children of Israel were subdued at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers."
14,13,19,"And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with its villages, and Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages."
14,13,20,"Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died."
14,13,21,"But Abijah grew mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begot twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters."
14,13,22,"And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo."
14,14,1,"So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years."
14,14,2,"And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:"
14,14,3,"For he took away the altars of the foreign gods, and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the idol poles:"
14,14,4,"And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment."
14,14,5,"Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense altars: and the kingdom was quiet under him."
14,14,6,"And he built fortified cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest."
14,14,7,"Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered."
14,14,8,"And Asa had an army of men that bore large shields and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor."
14,14,9,"And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah."
14,14,10,"Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah."
14,14,11,"And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with you to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on you, and in your name we go against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let not man prevail against you."
14,14,12,"So the LORD defeated the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled."
14,14,13,"And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, so that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his army; and they carried away very much plunder."
14,14,14,"And they defeated all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they plundered all the cities; for there was very much plunder in them."
14,14,15,"They struck also the enclosures of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem."
14,15,1,"And the spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:"
14,15,2,"And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while you are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you."
14,15,3,"Now for a long time Israel has been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law."
14,15,4,"But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them."
14,15,5,"And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great turmoil was upon all the inhabitants of the countries."
14,15,6,"And nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city: for God did trouble them with all adversity."
14,15,7,"Be you strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded."
14,15,8,"And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken in the mountains of Ephraim, and repaired the altar of the LORD, that was before the vestibule of the LORD."
14,15,9,"And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the sojourners with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they came over to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him."
14,15,10,"So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa."
14,15,11,"And they offered unto the LORD on that day some of the plunder which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep."
14,15,12,"And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;"
14,15,13,"That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman."
14,15,14,"And they swore unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with horns."
14,15,15,"And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about."
14,15,16,"And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an abominable image on an idol pole: and Asa cut down her idol, and crushed it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron."
14,15,17,"But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days."
14,15,18,"And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels."
14,15,19,"And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa."
14,16,1,"In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah."
14,16,2,"Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the kingâ€™s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,"
14,16,3,"Let there be a treaty between me and you, as there was between my father and your father: behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me."
14,16,4,"And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali."
14,16,5,"And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah, and let his work cease."
14,16,6,"Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, with which Baasha was building; and he built with them Geba and Mizpah."
14,16,7,"And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD your God, therefore has the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand."
14,16,8,"Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because you did rely on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand."
14,16,9,"For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. In this you have done foolishly: therefore from now on you shall have wars."
14,16,10,"Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time."
14,16,11,"And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14,16,12,"And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease became severe: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians."
14,16,13,"And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign."
14,16,14,"And they buried him in his own sepulcher, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet ointments and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumerâ€™s art: and they made a very great fire in honor of him."
14,17,1,"And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel."
14,17,2,"And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken."
14,17,3,"And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;"
14,17,4,"But sought to the LORD God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel."
14,17,5,"Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he had riches and honor in abundance."
14,17,6,"And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and idol poles out of Judah."
14,17,7,"Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his leaders, even to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethanel, and to Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah."
14,17,8,"And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests."
14,17,9,"And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people."
14,17,10,"And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat."
14,17,11,"Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats."
14,17,12,"And Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built in Judah fortresses, and storage cities."
14,17,13,"And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valor, were in Jerusalem."
14,17,14,"And these are the numbers of them according to their fatherâ€™s houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand."
14,17,15,"And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand."
14,17,16,"And next to him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor."
14,17,17,"And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand."
14,17,18,"And next to him was Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and fourscore thousand prepared for war."
14,17,19,"These served the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah."
14,18,1,"Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and made a marriage alliance with Ahab."
14,18,2,"And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead."
14,18,3,"And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as you are, and my people as your people; and we will be with you in the war."
14,18,4,"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray you, for the word of the LORD today."
14,18,5,"Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the kingâ€™s hand."
14,18,6,"But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?"
14,18,7,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so."
14,18,8,"And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imla."
14,18,9,"And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat each of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them."
14,18,10,"And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made himself horns of iron, and said, Thus says the LORD, With these you shall push Syria until they are consumed."
14,18,11,"And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king."
14,18,12,"And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let your word therefore, I pray you, be like one of theirs, and speak you good."
14,18,13,"And Micaiah said, As the LORD lives, even what my God says, that will I speak."
14,18,14,"And when he had come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go you up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand."
14,18,15,"And the king said to him, How many times shall I make you swear that you say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?"
14,18,16,"Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said,"
14,18,17,"And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?"
14,18,18,"Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left."
14,18,19,"And the LORD said,"
14,18,20,"Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him,"
14,18,21,"And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the LORD said,"
14,18,22,"Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets, and the LORD has spoken evil against you."
14,18,23,"Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto you?"
14,18,24,"And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself."
14,18,25,"Then the king of Israel said, Take you Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the kingâ€™s son;"
14,18,26,"And say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with little bread and with little water, until I return in peace."
14,18,27,"And Micaiah said, If you ever return in peace, then has not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all you people."
14,18,28,"So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead."
14,18,29,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put you on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle."
14,18,30,"Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight you not with small or great, except only with the king of Israel."
14,18,31,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they surrounded him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God led them to depart from him."
14,18,32,"For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him."
14,18,33,"And a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn your hand, that you may carry me out of the battle; for I am wounded."
14,18,34,"And the battle increased that day: and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening: and about the time of the sun going down he died."
14,19,1,"And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem."
14,19,2,"And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Should you help the wicked, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath came upon you from the LORD."
14,19,3,"Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you have taken away the idol poles out of the land, and have prepared your heart to seek God."
14,19,4,"And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers."
14,19,5,"And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,"
14,19,6,"And said to the judges, Take heed what you do: for you judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment."
14,19,7,"Therefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes."
14,19,8,"Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat appoint some of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the heads of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem."
14,19,9,"And he charged them, saying, Thus shall you do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart."
14,19,10,"And whatsoever cause shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, you shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so bring wrath upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and you shall not trespass."
14,19,11,"And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the kingâ€™s matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good."
14,20,1,"It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them others besides the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle."
14,20,2,"Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There comes a great multitude against you from beyond the sea on this side of Edom; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar, which is En-gedi."
14,20,3,"And Jehoshaphat feared, and set his face to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah."
14,20,4,"And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD."
14,20,5,"And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,"
14,20,6,"And said, O LORD God of our fathers, are not you God in heaven? and rule you not over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in your hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand you?"
14,20,7,"Are not you our God, who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and gave it to the descendants of Abraham your friend forever?"
14,20,8,"And they dwelt in it, and have built you a sanctuary in it for your name, saying,"
14,20,9,"If, when evil comes upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in your presence, (for your name is in this house,) and cry unto you in our affliction, then you will hear and help."
14,20,10,"And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;"
14,20,11,"Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit."
14,20,12,"O our God, will you not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon you."
14,20,13,"And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children."
14,20,14,"Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;"
14,20,15,"And he said, Hearken you, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you king Jehoshaphat, Thus says the LORD unto you,"
14,20,16,""
14,20,17,""
14,20,18,"And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshiping the LORD."
14,20,19,"And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high."
14,20,20,"And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall you be established; believe his prophets, so shall you prosper."
14,20,21,"And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endures forever."
14,20,22,"And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, who were come against Judah; and they were defeated."
14,20,23,"For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, to slay and destroy them utterly: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy one another."
14,20,24,"And when Judah came to the watchtower in the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped."
14,20,25,"And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in the gathering of the spoil, it was so much."
14,20,26,"And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Beracah, unto this day."
14,20,27,"Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies."
14,20,28,"And they came to Jerusalem with lyres and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD."
14,20,29,"And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel."
14,20,30,"So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about."
14,20,31,"And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi."
14,20,32,"And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD."
14,20,33,"However the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers."
14,20,34,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel."
14,20,35,"And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:"
14,20,36,"And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-geber."
14,20,37,"Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has broken your works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish."
14,21,1,"Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead."
14,21,2,"And he had brothers the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel."
14,21,3,"And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn."
14,21,4,"Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel."
14,21,5,"Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem."
14,21,6,"And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab as his wife: and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD."
14,21,7,"Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons forever."
14,21,8,"In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king."
14,21,9,"Then Jehoram went forth with his officers, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots."
14,21,10,"So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers."
14,21,11,"Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotries, and led Judah astray."
14,21,12,"And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says the LORD God of David your father,"
14,21,13,""
14,21,14,""
14,21,15,""
14,21,16,"Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:"
14,21,17,"And they came up into Judah, and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the kingâ€™s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was not a son left him, except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons."
14,21,18,"And after all this the LORD struck him in his intestines with an incurable disease."
14,21,19,"And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his intestines fell out because of his sickness: so he died in great pain. And his people made no fire in his honor, like the fires made for his fathers."
14,21,20,"Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without anyoneâ€™s regret. However they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings."
14,22,1,"And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned."
14,22,2,"Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s name also was Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri."
14,22,3,"He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly."
14,22,4,"Therefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction."
14,22,5,"He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram."
14,22,6,"And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick."
14,22,7,"And the downfall of Ahaziah was of God by his coming to Joram: for when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab."
14,22,8,"And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he killed them."
14,22,9,"And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he had hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, they said, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no one able to rule the kingdom."
14,22,10,"But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal descendants of the house of Judah."
14,22,11,"But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the kingâ€™s sons that were being slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not."
14,22,12,"And he was hid with them in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land."
14,23,1,"And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with himself."
14,23,2,"And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem."
14,23,3,"And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the kingâ€™s son shall reign, as the LORD has said of the sons of David."
14,23,4,"This is the thing that you shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be gatekeepers of the doors;"
14,23,5,"And a third part shall be at the kingâ€™s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD."
14,23,6,"But let none come into the house of the LORD, except the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD."
14,23,7,"And the Levites shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else comes into the house, he shall be put to death: but you be with the king when he comes in, and when he goes out."
14,23,8,"So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took everyone his men that were to come on duty on the sabbath, with them that were to go off duty on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the divisions."
14,23,9,"Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and large, and small shields, that had been king Davidâ€™s, which were in the house of God."
14,23,10,"And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, all around the king."
14,23,11,"Then they brought out the kingâ€™s son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, Long live the king."
14,23,12,"Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:"
14,23,13,"And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entrance, and the leaders and the trumpeters by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason."
14,23,14,"Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the army, and said unto them, Bring her forth between the ranks: and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD."
14,23,15,"So they laid hands on her; and when she had come to the entrance of the horse gate by the kingâ€™s house, they killed her there."
14,23,16,"And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be the LORDâ€™S people."
14,23,17,"Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke its altars and its images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars."
14,23,18,"Also Jehoiada appointed the oversight of the house of the LORD to the hands of the priests, the Levites, whom David had assigned in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David."
14,23,19,"And he set the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in anything should enter in."
14,23,20,"And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the kingâ€™s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom."
14,23,21,"And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after they had slain Athaliah with the sword."
14,24,1,"Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s name also was Zibiah of Beer-sheba."
14,24,2,"And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest."
14,24,3,"And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters."
14,24,4,"And it came to pass after this, that Joash had a mind to repair the house of the LORD."
14,24,5,"And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you hasten the matter. But the Levites hastened it not."
14,24,6,"And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why have you not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?"
14,24,7,"For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they dedicate to Baalim."
14,24,8,"And at the kingâ€™s commandment they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of the LORD."
14,24,9,"And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness."
14,24,10,"And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had finished."
14,24,11,"Now it came to pass, that at whatsoever time the chest was brought unto the kingâ€™s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the kingâ€™s scribe and the high priestâ€™s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance."
14,24,12,"And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as worked in iron and bronze to restore the house of the LORD."
14,24,13,"So the workmen labored, and the work was completed by them, and they put the house of God in order, and strengthened it."
14,24,14,"And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which were made articles for the house of the LORD, even articles for ministering, and for offering, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada."
14,24,15,"But Jehoiada grew old, and was full of days when he died; a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died."
14,24,16,"And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house."
14,24,17,"Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and bowed before the king. Then the king hearkened unto them."
14,24,18,"And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served idol poles and other idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass."
14,24,19,"Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear."
14,24,20,"And the spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus says God,"
14,24,21,"And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD."
14,24,22,"Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and repay it."
14,24,23,"And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus."
14,24,24,"For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash."
14,24,25,"And when they were departed from him, (for they left him severely wounded,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchers of the kings."
14,24,26,"And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess."
14,24,27,"Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead."
14,25,1,"Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem."
14,25,2,"And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart."
14,25,3,"Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father."
14,25,4,"But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying,"
14,25,5,"Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to their fathersâ€™ houses, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield."
14,25,6,"He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver."
14,25,7,"But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with you; for the LORD is not with Israel, not with all the children of Ephraim."
14,25,8,"But if you will go, do it, be strong for the battle: but God shall make you fall before the enemy: for God has power to help, and to cast down."
14,25,9,"And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give you much more than this."
14,25,10,"Then Amaziah separated them, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger."
14,25,11,"And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and killed of the children of Seir ten thousand."
14,25,12,"And another ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were dashed to pieces."
14,25,13,"But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and killed three thousand of them, and took much spoil."
14,25,14,"Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them."
14,25,15,"Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, who said unto him, Why have you sought after the gods of the people, who could not deliver their own people out of your hand?"
14,25,16,"And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Are you made the kingâ€™s counselor? stop; why should you be killed? Then the prophet stopped, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not hearkened unto my counsel."
14,25,17,"Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face."
14,25,18,"And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as a wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle."
14,25,19,"You say, Lo, you have smitten the Edomites; and your heart lifts you up to boast: abide now at home; why should you meddle to your hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?"
14,25,20,"But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom."
14,25,21,"So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they looked one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah."
14,25,22,"And Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled every man to his tent."
14,25,23,"And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits."
14,25,24,"And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the kingâ€™s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria."
14,25,25,"And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years."
14,25,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?"
14,25,27,"Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there."
14,25,28,"And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah."
14,26,1,"Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah."
14,26,2,"He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers."
14,26,3,"Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem."
14,26,4,"And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did."
14,26,5,"And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper."
14,26,6,"And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities around Ashdod, and among the Philistines."
14,26,7,"And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunites."
14,26,8,"And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly."
14,26,9,"Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them."
14,26,10,"Also he built towers in the desert, and dug many wells: for he had many cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: farmers also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved the soil."
14,26,11,"Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war by divisions, according to the number on their roll by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the kingâ€™s captains."
14,26,12,"The whole number of the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of the mighty men of valor were two thousand and six hundred."
14,26,13,"And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy."
14,26,14,"And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and body armor, and bows, and slings to cast stones."
14,26,15,"And he made in Jerusalem devices, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and upon the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, till he was strong."
14,26,16,"But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense."
14,26,17,"And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:"
14,26,18,"And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It belongs not unto you, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither shall it be for your honor from the LORD God."
14,26,19,"Then Uzziah was angry, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was angry with the priests, leprosy even broke out in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar."
14,26,20,"And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from there; yea, he himself hastened also to go out, because the LORD had struck him."
14,26,21,"And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the kingâ€™s house, judging the people of the land."
14,26,22,"Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write."
14,26,23,"So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead."
14,27,1,"Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s name also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok."
14,27,2,"And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: although he entered not into the temple of the LORD. But the people acted yet corruptly."
14,27,3,"He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much."
14,27,4,"Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built forts and towers."
14,27,5,"He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third."
14,27,6,"So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God."
14,27,7,"Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
14,27,8,"He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem."
14,27,9,"And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead."
14,28,1,"Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:"
14,28,2,"For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim."
14,28,3,"Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the nations which the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel."
14,28,4,"He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree."
14,28,5,"Therefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they defeated him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who defeated him with a great slaughter."
14,28,6,"For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, who were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers."
14,28,7,"And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the kingâ€™s son, and Azrikam the officer over the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king."
14,28,8,"And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria."
14,28,9,"But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the army that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage that reaches up unto heaven."
14,28,10,"And now you purpose to subjugate the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?"
14,28,11,"Now hear me therefore, and return the captives, whom you have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you."
14,28,12,"Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,"
14,28,13,"And said unto them, You shall not bring in the captives here: for since we have offended against the LORD already, you intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel."
14,28,14,"So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation."
14,28,15,"And the men who were mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and dressed them, and gave them sandals, and gave them food and drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria."
14,28,16,"At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him."
14,28,17,"For again the Edomites had come and attacked Judah, and carried away captives."
14,28,18,"The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with its villages, and Timnah with its villages, Gimzo also and its villages: and they dwelt there."
14,28,19,"For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed greatly against the LORD."
14,28,20,"And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, and strengthened him not."
14,28,21,"For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not."
14,28,22,"And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz."
14,28,23,"For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which had defeated him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel."
14,28,24,"And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem."
14,28,25,"And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers."
14,28,26,"Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14,28,27,"And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead."
14,29,1,"Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah."
14,29,2,"And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done."
14,29,3,"He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them."
14,29,4,"And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street,"
14,29,5,"And said unto them, Hear me, you Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filth out of the holy place."
14,29,6,"For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs."
14,29,7,"Also they have shut up the doors of the vestibule, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel."
14,29,8,"Therefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as you see with your eyes."
14,29,9,"For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this."
14,29,10,"Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us."
14,29,11,"My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD has chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that you should minister unto him, and burn incense."
14,29,12,"Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:"
14,29,13,"And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeuel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:"
14,29,14,"And of the sons of Heman; Jehuel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel."
14,29,15,"And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD."
14,29,16,"And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron."
14,29,17,"Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the vestibule of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they finished."
14,29,18,"Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all its utensils, and the showbread table, with all its utensils."
14,29,19,"Moreover all the utensils, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD."
14,29,20,"Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD."
14,29,21,"And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD."
14,29,22,"So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar."
14,29,23,"And they brought forth the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:"
14,29,24,"And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel."
14,29,25,"And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with lyres, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the kingâ€™s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets."
14,29,26,"And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets."
14,29,27,"And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel."
14,29,28,"And all the congregation worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished."
14,29,29,"And when they had finished offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshiped."
14,29,30,"Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped."
14,29,31,"Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now you have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings."
14,29,32,"And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD."
14,29,33,"And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep."
14,29,34,"But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings: therefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests."
14,29,35,"And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order."
14,29,36,"And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly."
14,30,1,"And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel."
14,30,2,"For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month."
14,30,3,"For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem."
14,30,4,"And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation."
14,30,5,"So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it for a long time in the way in which it was written."
14,30,6,"So the runners went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, You children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria."
14,30,7,"And be not like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as you see."
14,30,8,"Now be you not stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you."
14,30,9,"For if you turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return unto him."
14,30,10,"So the runners passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them."
14,30,11,"Nevertheless some from Asher and Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem."
14,30,12,"Also the hand of God was upon Judah to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD."
14,30,13,"And there assembled at Jerusalem many people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation."
14,30,14,"And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron."
14,30,15,"Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD."
14,30,16,"And they stood in their place according to their custom, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received from the hand of the Levites."
14,30,17,"For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had charge of the killing of the passover lambs for everyone that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD."
14,30,18,"For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon everyone"
14,30,19,"That prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary."
14,30,20,"And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people."
14,30,21,"And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD."
14,30,22,"And Hezekiah spoke encouragingly unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers."
14,30,23,"And the whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days: and they kept another seven days with gladness."
14,30,24,"For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves."
14,30,25,"And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced."
14,30,26,"So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was nothing like this in Jerusalem."
14,30,27,"Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven."
14,31,1,"Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the sacred pillars in pieces, and cut down the idol poles, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities."
14,31,2,"And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites according to their divisions, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of the LORD."
14,31,3,"He appointed also the kingâ€™s portion of his possessions for the burnt offerings, the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD."
14,31,4,"Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD."
14,31,5,"And as soon as the commandment was spread abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of grain, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly."
14,31,6,"And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them in heaps."
14,31,7,"In the third month they began laying them in heaps, and finished them in the seventh month."
14,31,8,"And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel."
14,31,9,"Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps."
14,31,10,"And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have plenty left: for the LORD has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great abundance."
14,31,11,"Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,"
14,31,12,"And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was in charge, and Shimei his brother was next."
14,31,13,"And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God."
14,31,14,"And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the east gate, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the offerings to the LORD, and the most holy things."
14,31,15,"And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, assisting him to give the portions to their brethren by divisions, to the old as well as to the young:"
14,31,16,"Besides their males enrolled by genealogy, from three years old and upward, even unto everyone that enters into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their work according to their divisions;"
14,31,17,"And to the priests enrolled by genealogy according to their fathersâ€™ house, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their work by their divisions;"
14,31,18,"And to all enrolled by genealogy, their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their faithfulness they sanctified themselves in holiness:"
14,31,19,"Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the pasture lands of their cities, in every city, men were designated by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were listed by genealogies among the Levites."
14,31,20,"And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and did that which was good and right and true before the LORD his God."
14,31,21,"And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered."
14,32,1,"After these things, and the establishment of them, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself."
14,32,2,"And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,"
14,32,3,"He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were outside the city: and they did help him."
14,32,4,"So there were gathered many people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?"
14,32,5,"Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall outside, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance."
14,32,6,"And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,"
14,32,7,"Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed by the king of Assyria, nor by all the multitude that is with him: for there are more with us than with him:"
14,32,8,"With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people encouraged themselves by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah."
14,32,9,"After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his forces with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,"
14,32,10,"Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria, On what do you trust, that you remain in the siege in Jerusalem?"
14,32,11,"Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?"
14,32,12,"Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, You shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?"
14,32,13,"Know you not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand?"
14,32,14,"Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?"
14,32,15,"Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this way, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?"
14,32,16,"And his servants spoke yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah."
14,32,17,"He wrote also letters to revile the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand."
14,32,18,"Then they cried with a loud voice in the language of Judah unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city."
14,32,19,"And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man."
14,32,20,"And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven."
14,32,21,"And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he had come into the house of his god, sons that came forth of his own body struck him down there with the sword."
14,32,22,"Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side."
14,32,23,"And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and precious gifts to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from that time on."
14,32,24,"In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spoke unto him, and he gave him a sign."
14,32,25,"But Hezekiah returned not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem."
14,32,26,"Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah."
14,32,27,"And Hezekiah had exceedingly great riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of costly articles;"
14,32,28,"Storehouses also for the increase of grain, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of animals, and folds for flocks."
14,32,29,"Moreover he provided himself cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him very great possessions."
14,32,30,"This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper water outlet of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works."
14,32,31,"However, regarding the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who were sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart."
14,32,32,"Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."
14,32,33,"And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper sepulchers of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead."
14,33,1,"Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:"
14,33,2,"But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the nations, which the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel."
14,33,3,"For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he raised up altars for Baalim, and made idol poles, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them."
14,33,4,"Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said,"
14,33,5,"And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD."
14,33,6,"And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he practiced soothsaying, and used sorcery, and used witchcraft, and dealt with mediums, and with wizards: he did much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger."
14,33,7,"And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son,"
14,33,8,""
14,33,9,"So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the nations, which the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel."
14,33,10,"And the LORD spoke to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken."
14,33,11,"Therefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with hooks, and bound him with bronze fetters, and carried him to Babylon."
14,33,12,"And when he was in affliction, he sought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,"
14,33,13,"And prayed unto him: and he received his entreaty, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD was God."
14,33,14,"Now after this he built a wall outside the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance of the fish gate, and enclosed Ophel, and raised it up to a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fortified cities of Judah."
14,33,15,"And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city."
14,33,16,"And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed on it peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel."
14,33,17,"Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only."
14,33,18,"Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel."
14,33,19,"His prayer also, and how God received his entreaty, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up idol poles and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers."
14,33,20,"So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead."
14,33,21,"Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem."
14,33,22,"But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;"
14,33,23,"And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more."
14,33,24,"And his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his own house."
14,33,25,"But the people of the land killed all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead."
14,34,1,"Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years."
14,34,2,"And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and turned aside neither to the right hand, nor to the left."
14,34,3,"For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the idol poles, and the carved images, and the molten images."
14,34,4,"And they broke down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the idol poles, and the carved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and scattered it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them."
14,34,5,"And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem."
14,34,6,"And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, in their ruins round about."
14,34,7,"And when he had broken down the altars and the idol poles, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem."
14,34,8,"Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God."
14,34,9,"And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem."
14,34,10,"And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that worked in the house of the LORD, to repair and restore the house:"
14,34,11,"Even to the craftsmen and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for beams, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed."
14,34,12,"And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to have oversight; and other of the Levites, all that were skillful with instruments of music."
14,34,13,"Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that did the work in any kind of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and gatekeepers."
14,34,14,"And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses."
14,34,15,"And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan."
14,34,16,"And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to your servants, they are doing."
14,34,17,"And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen."
14,34,18,"Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king."
14,34,19,"And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he tore his clothes."
14,34,20,"And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,"
14,34,21,"Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book."
14,34,22,"And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter:) and they spoke to her to that effect."
14,34,23,"And she answered them, Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,"
14,34,24,"Thus says the LORD,"
14,34,25,""
14,34,26,"And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall you say unto him,"
14,34,27,""
14,34,28,""
14,34,29,"Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem."
14,34,30,"And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD."
14,34,31,"And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book."
14,34,32,"And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers."
14,34,33,"And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the country that belonged to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers."
14,35,1,"Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month."
14,35,2,"And he set the priests in their duties, and encouraged them for the service of the house of the LORD,"
14,35,3,"And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, who were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall no longer be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,"
14,35,4,"And prepare yourselves according to your fathersâ€™ houses, according to your divisions, according to the writings of David king of Israel, and according to the writings of Solomon his son."
14,35,5,"And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathersâ€™ houses of your brethren the lay people, and according to the division of the families of the Levites."
14,35,6,"So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses."
14,35,7,"And Josiah gave to the people, from the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the kingâ€™s possessions."
14,35,8,"And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen."
14,35,9,"Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chiefs of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen."
14,35,10,"So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their places, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the kingâ€™s commandment."
14,35,11,"And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites skinned them."
14,35,12,"And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen."
14,35,13,"And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them quickly among all the lay people."
14,35,14,"And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy in the offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron."
14,35,15,"And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the kingâ€™s seer; and the gatekeepers waited at every gate; they did not need to depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them."
14,35,16,"So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah."
14,35,17,"And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days."
14,35,18,"And there was no passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
14,35,19,"In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept."
14,35,20,"After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him."
14,35,21,"But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you this day, but against the house with which I am at war: for God commanded me to make haste: cease from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroys you not."
14,35,22,"Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo."
14,35,23,"And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Take me away; for I am badly wounded."
14,35,24,"His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchers of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah."
14,35,25,"And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations."
14,35,26,"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,"
14,35,27,"And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
14,36,1,"Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his fatherâ€™s stead in Jerusalem."
14,36,2,"Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem."
14,36,3,"And the king of Egypt dethroned him at Jerusalem, and imposed on the land a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold."
14,36,4,"And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt."
14,36,5,"Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God."
14,36,6,"Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon."
14,36,7,"Nebuchadnezzar also carried part of the articles of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon."
14,36,8,"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead."
14,36,9,"Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD."
14,36,10,"And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the costly articles from the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem."
14,36,11,"Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem."
14,36,12,"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD."
14,36,13,"And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning unto the LORD God of Israel."
14,36,14,"Moreover all the leaders of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much according to all the abominations of the nations; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem."
14,36,15,"And the LORD God of their fathers sent word to them by his messengers, sending them time and again; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:"
14,36,16,"But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy."
14,36,17,"Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that was stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand."
14,36,18,"And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon."
14,36,19,"And they burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its costly possessions."
14,36,20,"And those that had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the rule of the kingdom of Persia:"
14,36,21,"To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths: for as long as it lay desolate it kept sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years."
14,36,22,"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,"
14,36,23,"Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth has the LORD God of heaven given me; and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up."
15,1,1,"Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,"
15,1,2,"Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah."
15,1,3,"Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem."
15,1,4,"And whosoever remains in any place where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with animals, besides the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem."
15,1,5,"Then rose up the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had stirred, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem."
15,1,6,"And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with articles of silver, with gold, with goods, and with animals, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered."
15,1,7,"Also Cyrus the king brought forth the articles of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;"
15,1,8,"Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and counted them out unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah."
15,1,9,"And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, nine and twenty knives,"
15,1,10,"Thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a similar sort four hundred and ten, and other articles a thousand."
15,1,11,"All the articles of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with those of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem."
15,2,1,"Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city;"
15,2,2,"Who came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:"
15,2,3,"The children of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy and two."

15,2,59,"And these were they who went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harhsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer: but they could not prove their fatherâ€™s house, and their descent, whether they were of Israel:"
15,2,60,"The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two."
15,2,61,"And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai; who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name:"
15,2,62,"These sought their listing among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as defiled, excluded from the priesthood."
15,2,63,"And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till a priest could consult with Urim and with Thummim."
15,2,64,"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,"
15,2,65,"Beside their male and female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women."
15,2,66,"Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;"
15,2,67,"Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their donkeys, six thousand seven hundred and twenty."
15,2,68,"And some of the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in its place:"
15,2,69,"They gave according to their ability to the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestsâ€™ garments."
15,2,70,"So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their towns, and all Israel in their towns."
15,3,1,"And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the towns, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem."
15,3,2,"Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God."
15,3,3,"And they set the altar upon its bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening."
15,3,4,"They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required;"
15,3,5,"And afterward offered the continual burnt offerings, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD."
15,3,6,"From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid."
15,3,7,"They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and food, and drink, and oil, unto them of Sidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea to Joppa, according to the grant that they had from Cyrus king of Persia."
15,3,8,"Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to oversee the work of the house of the LORD."
15,3,9,"Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to oversee the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites."
15,3,10,"And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, according to the ordinance of David king of Israel."
15,3,11,"And they sang together responsively in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endures forever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid."
15,3,12,"But many of the priests and Levites and heads of the fathersâ€™ houses, who were old men, who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:"
15,3,13,"So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off."
15,4,1,"Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity built the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;"
15,4,2,"Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as you do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here."
15,4,3,"But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of Israel, said unto them, You have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us."
15,4,4,"Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,"
15,4,5,"And hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia."
15,4,6,"And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem."
15,4,7,"And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in Aramaic, and set forth in the Aramaic language."
15,4,8,"Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this fashion:"
15,4,9,"Then wrote Rehum the commander, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the judges, the governors, the officials, the Persians, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, and the Elamites,"
15,4,10,"And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and settled in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and so forth."
15,4,11,"This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Your servants the men on this side the river, send greetings."
15,4,12,"Be it known unto the king, that the Jews who came up from you to us have come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and wicked city, and are finishing its walls, and repairing the foundations."
15,4,13,"Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city is built, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so you shall impair the revenue of the kings."
15,4,14,"Now because we receive support from the kingâ€™s palace, and it was not proper for us to see the kingâ€™s dishonor, therefore have we sent and informed the king;"
15,4,15,"That search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers: so shall you find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and harmful unto kings and provinces, and that they have incited sedition within the city from of old: for which cause was this city destroyed."
15,4,16,"We inform the king that, if this city is built again, and its walls finished, by this means you shall have no dominion on this side of the river."
15,4,17,"Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the commander, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and so forth."
15,4,18,"The letter which you sent unto us has been plainly read before me."
15,4,19,"And I commanded, and search has been made, and it is found that this city from of old has made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it."
15,4,20,"There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them."
15,4,21,"Give you now command to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until another command shall be given from me."
15,4,22,"Take heed now that you fail not to do this: why should damage increase to the hurt of the kings?"
15,4,23,"Now when the copy of king Artaxerxesâ€™ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power."
15,4,24,"Then ceased the work on the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia."
15,5,1,"Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them."
15,5,2,"Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them."
15,5,3,"At the same time came to them Tattenai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who has commanded you to build this house, and to restore this wall?"
15,5,4,"Then said we unto them after this manner, These are the names of the men that make this building."
15,5,5,"But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned an answer by letter concerning this matter."
15,5,6,"The copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the governors, who were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:"
15,5,7,"They sent a letter unto him, in which was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace."
15,5,8,"Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goes on diligently, and prospers in their hands."
15,5,9,"Then asked we those elders, and said unto them, Who commanded you to build this house, and to complete these walls?"
15,5,10,"We asked their names also, to inform you, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them."
15,5,11,"And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished."
15,5,12,"But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon."
15,5,13,"But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God."
15,5,14,"And the articles also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;"
15,5,15,"And said unto him, Take these articles, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place."
15,5,16,"Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now has it been in building, and yet it is not finished."
15,5,17,"Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let there be search made in the kingâ€™s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter."
15,6,1,"Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the scrolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon."
15,6,2,"And there was found at Ecbatana, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a scroll, and in it was a record thus written:"
15,6,3,"In the first year of Cyrus the king, the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let its foundations be strongly laid; its height threescore cubits, and its breadth threescore cubits;"
15,6,4,"With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the kingâ€™s house:"
15,6,5,"And also let the golden and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place, and place them in the house of God."
15,6,6,"Now therefore, Tattenai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the governors, who are beyond the river, keep yourselves far from there:"
15,6,7,"Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place."
15,6,8,"Moreover I make a decree of what you shall do for the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the kingâ€™s goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, without delay expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered."
15,6,9,"And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the requirement of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:"
15,6,10,"That they may offer sacrifices of sweet aroma unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons."
15,6,11,"Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be impaled thereon; and let his house be made a pile of rubble because of this."
15,6,12,"And the God that has caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put their hand to alter it and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done diligently."
15,6,13,"Then Tattenai, governor on this side of the river, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily."
15,6,14,"And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."
15,6,15,"And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king."
15,6,16,"And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,"
15,6,17,"And offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel."
15,6,18,"And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their divisions, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses."
15,6,19,"And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month."
15,6,20,"For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were purified, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves."
15,6,21,"And the children of Israel, who had come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the nations of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,"
15,6,22,"And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel."
15,7,1,"Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,"
15,7,2,"The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,"
15,7,3,"The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,"
15,7,4,"The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,"
15,7,5,"The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:"
15,7,6,"This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a skilled scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him."
15,7,7,"And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king."
15,7,8,"And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king."
15,7,9,"For upon the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him."
15,7,10,"For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances."
15,7,11,"Now this is the copy of the letter that king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel."
15,7,12,"Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and so forth."
15,7,13,"I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, who are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, may go with you."
15,7,14,"For as you are sent by the king, and by his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your hand;"
15,7,15,"And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,"
15,7,16,"And all the silver and gold that you can find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offered willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem:"
15,7,17,"That you may buy promptly with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem."
15,7,18,"And whatsoever shall seem good to you, and to your brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do according to the will of your God."
15,7,19,"The articles also that are given you for the service of the house of your God, those you shall deliver before the God of Jerusalem."
15,7,20,"And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of your God, which you shall have occasion to provide, provide it out of the kingâ€™s treasure house."
15,7,21,"And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done promptly,"
15,7,22,"Unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred cors of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much."
15,7,23,"Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?"
15,7,24,"Also we inform you, that concerning any of the priests and Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them."
15,7,25,"And you, Ezra, after the wisdom of your God, that is in your hand, set magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of your God; and teach them that know them not."
15,7,26,"And whosoever will not do the law of your God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment."
15,7,27,"Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the kingâ€™s heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem:"
15,7,28,"And has extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counselors, and before all the kingâ€™s mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel leading men to go up with me."
15,8,1,"These are now the heads of their fathersâ€™ houses, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king."
15,8,2,"Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush."
15,8,3,"Of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh; Zechariah: and with him were registered by genealogy of the men a hundred and fifty."
15,8,4,"Of the sons of Pahath-moab; Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred men."
15,8,5,"Of the sons of Shecaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred men."
15,8,6,"Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty men."
15,8,7,"And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy men."
15,8,8,"And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore men."
15,8,9,"Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen men."
15,8,10,"And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred and threescore men."
15,8,11,"And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight men."
15,8,12,"And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten men."
15,8,13,"And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore men."
15,8,14,"Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zaccur, and with them seventy men."
15,8,15,"And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi."
15,8,16,"Then I sent for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, leading men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding."
15,8,17,"And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God."
15,8,18,"And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;"
15,8,19,"And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;"
15,8,20,"Also of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were registered by name."
15,8,21,"Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our possessions."
15,8,22,"For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him."
15,8,23,"So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he answered our prayer."
15,8,24,"Then I separated twelve of the leaders of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,"
15,8,25,"And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the articles, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:"
15,8,26,"I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver articles worth a hundred talents, and of gold a hundred talents;"
15,8,27,"Also twenty bowls of gold, worth a thousand darics; and two vessels of fine polished bronze, as precious as gold."
15,8,28,"And I said unto them, You are holy unto the LORD; the articles are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers."
15,8,29,"Watch, and keep them, until you weigh them before the leaders of the priests and the Levites, and heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD."
15,8,30,"So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the articles, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God."
15,8,31,"Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way."
15,8,32,"And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days."
15,8,33,"Now on the fourth day were the silver and the gold and the articles weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;"
15,8,34,"With the number and weight of everything: and all the weight was recorded at that time."
15,8,35,"Also the children of those that had been carried away, who had come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve male goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD."
15,8,36,"And they delivered the kingâ€™s orders unto the kingâ€™s satraps, and to the governors on this side the river: and they aided the people, and the house of God."
15,9,1,"Now when these things were done, the leaders came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, in regard to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites."
15,9,2,"For they have taken of their daughters as wives for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy race has mixed itself with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the leaders and rulers has been foremost in this trespass."
15,9,3,"And when I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down appalled."
15,9,4,"Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat appalled until the evening sacrifice."
15,9,5,"And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having torn my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,"
15,9,6,"And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, my God: for our iniquities have risen higher than our head, and our trespass has grown up unto the heavens."
15,9,7,"Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to humiliation, as it is this day."
15,9,8,"And now for a little while grace has been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us security in his holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage."
15,9,9,"For we were slaves; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to rebuild the house of our God, and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem."
15,9,10,"And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken your commandments,"
15,9,11,"Which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which you go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness."
15,9,12,"Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth forever: that you may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever."
15,9,13,"And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that you our God has punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and has given us such deliverance as this;"
15,9,14,"Should we again break your commandments, and join in marriage with the people of these abominations? would not you be angry with us till you had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?"
15,9,15,"O LORD God of Israel, you are righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before you in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before you because of this."
15,10,1,"Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept bitterly."
15,10,2,"And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing."
15,10,3,"Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law."
15,10,4,"Arise; for this matter belongs unto you: we also will be with you: be of good courage, and do it."
15,10,5,"Then arose Ezra, and made the leading priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they swore."
15,10,6,"Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came there, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away."
15,10,7,"And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;"
15,10,8,"And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the order of the leaders and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and he himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away."
15,10,9,"Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and because of the heavy rain."
15,10,10,"And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, You have transgressed, and have taken foreign wives, to increase the trespass of Israel."
15,10,11,"Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the foreign wives."
15,10,12,"Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As you has said, so must we do."
15,10,13,"But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain, and we are not able to stand outside, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing."
15,10,14,"Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them who have taken foreign wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter is turned from us."
15,10,15,"Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them."
15,10,16,"And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain heads of the fathersâ€™ houses, according to their fathersâ€™ houses, and each of them by name, were set apart, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter."
15,10,17,"And they finished with all the men that had taken foreign wives by the first day of the first month."
15,10,18,"And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken foreign wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah."
15,10,19,"And they gave their promise that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass."
15,10,20,"And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah."
15,10,21,"And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah."
15,10,22,"And of the sons of Pashhur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah."
15,10,23,"Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer."
15,10,24,"Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the gatekeepers; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri."
15,10,25,"Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Izziah, and Malchijah, and Mijamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah."
15,10,26,"And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Elijah."
15,10,27,"And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza."
15,10,28,"Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai."
15,10,29,"And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Jeremoth."
15,10,30,"And of the sons of Pahath-moab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, and Binnui, and Manasseh."
15,10,31,"And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,"
15,10,32,"Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah."
15,10,33,"Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei."
15,10,34,"Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,"
15,10,35,"Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi,"
15,10,36,"Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,"
15,10,37,"Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu,"
15,10,38,"And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,"
15,10,39,"And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,"
15,10,40,"Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,"
15,10,41,"Azarel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,"
15,10,42,"Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph."
15,10,43,"Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, and Joel, Benaiah."
15,10,44,"All these had taken foreign wives: and some of them had wives by whom they had children."
16,1,1,"The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the citadel,"
16,1,2,"That Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem."
16,1,3,"And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great distress and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire."
16,1,4,"And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,"
16,1,5,"And said, I beseech you, O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God, that keeps covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:"
16,1,6,"Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may hear the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you now, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you: both I and my fatherâ€™s house have sinned."
16,1,7,"We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses."
16,1,8,"Remember, I beseech you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying,"
16,1,9,""
16,1,10,"Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand."
16,1,11,"O Lord, I beseech you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the kingâ€™s cupbearer."
16,2,1,"And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had never been sad before in his presence."
16,2,2,"Therefore the king said unto me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much afraid,"
16,2,3,"And said unto the king, Let the king live forever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathersâ€™ sepulchers, lies waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?"
16,2,4,"Then the king said unto me, For what do you make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven."
16,2,5,"And I said unto the king, If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathersâ€™ sepulchers, that I may rebuild it."
16,2,6,"And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall your journey be? and when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time."
16,2,7,"Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may let me pass over till I come into Judah;"
16,2,8,"And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the kingâ€™s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which pertains to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the temple that I shall enter into. And the king so granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me."
16,2,9,"Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the kingâ€™s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me."
16,2,10,"When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel."
16,2,11,"So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days."
16,2,12,"And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any animal with me, except the animal that I rode upon."
16,2,13,"And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even to the jackalâ€™s well, and to the refuse gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down; and the gates thereof were consumed with fire."
16,2,14,"Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the kingâ€™s pool: but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass."
16,2,15,"Then went I up in the night by the valley, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned."
16,2,16,"And the rulers knew not where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work."
16,2,17,"Then said I unto them, You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we are no more a reproach."
16,2,18,"Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the kingâ€™s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work."
16,2,19,"But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed at us, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you do? will you rebel against the king?"
16,2,20,"Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem."
16,3,1,"Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananel."
16,3,2,"And next unto him built the men of Jericho. And next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri."
16,3,3,"But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
16,3,4,"And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana."
16,3,5,"And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord."
16,3,6,"Moreover the old gate repaired Joiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
16,3,7,"And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, who were under the authority of the governor on this side of the river."
16,3,8,"Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the perfumers, and they restored Jerusalem unto the broad wall."
16,3,9,"And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem."
16,3,10,"And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, opposite his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabneiah."
16,3,11,"Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab, repaired another section, and the tower of the ovens."
16,3,12,"And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters."
16,3,13,"The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the refuse gate."
16,3,14,"But the refuse gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof."
16,3,15,"But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the kingâ€™s garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David."
16,3,16,"After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half district of Beth-zur, unto the place opposite the sepulchers of David, and to the pool that was man made, and unto the house of the mighty men."
16,3,17,"After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half district of Keilah, in his district."
16,3,18,"After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half district of Keilah."
16,3,19,"And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another section opposite the ascent to the armory at the turning of the wall."
16,3,20,"After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another section, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest."
16,3,21,"After him repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz another section, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib."
16,3,22,"And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain."
16,3,23,"After him repaired Benjamin and Hasshub opposite their house. After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by his house."
16,3,24,"After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another section, from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even unto the corner."
16,3,25,"Palal the son of Uzai, made repairs opposite the turning of the wall, and the tower which projects out from the kingâ€™s upper house, that was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh made repairs."
16,3,26,"Moreover the Nethinim dwelling in Ophel, repaired unto the place opposite the water gate toward the east, and the tower that projects out."
16,3,27,"After them the Tekoites repaired another section, opposite the great tower that lies out, even unto the wall of Ophel."
16,3,28,"From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one opposite his house."
16,3,29,"After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer opposite his house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate."
16,3,30,"After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another section. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah opposite his chamber."
16,3,31,"After him repaired Malchijah the goldsmithâ€™s son unto the house of the Nethinim, and of the merchants, opposite the gate Hammiphkad, and to the upper chamber of the corner."
16,3,32,"And between the upper chamber of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants."
16,4,1,"But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we built the wall, he was angry, and felt great indignation, and mocked the Jews."
16,4,2,"And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they finish in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?"
16,4,3,"Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox goes up, he shall even break down their stone wall."
16,4,4,"Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a spoil in a land of captivity:"
16,4,5,"And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before you: for they have provoked you to anger before the builders."
16,4,6,"So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work."
16,4,7,"But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being repaired, and that the breaks began to be closed, then they were very angry,"
16,4,8,"And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it."
16,4,9,"Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them."
16,4,10,"And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is failing, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall."
16,4,11,"And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease."
16,4,12,"And it came to pass, that when the Jews who dwelt near them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places where you shall return unto us they will be upon you."
16,4,13,"Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people according to their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows."
16,4,14,"And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses."
16,4,15,"And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, everyone unto his work."
16,4,16,"And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants worked in the work, and the other half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the armor; and the rulers supported all the house of Judah."
16,4,17,"They who built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, so burdened themselves, everyone with one of his hands worked in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon."
16,4,18,"For the builders, everyone had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me."
16,4,19,"And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another."
16,4,20,"In whatever place therefore you hear the sound of the trumpet, come you there unto us: our God shall fight for us."
16,4,21,"So we labored in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared."
16,4,22,"Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labor during the day."
16,4,23,"So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing."
16,5,1,"And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews."
16,5,2,"For there were those that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore let us get grain for them, that we may eat, and live."
16,5,3,"Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy grain, because of the famine."
16,5,4,"There were also those that said, We have borrowed money for the kingâ€™s tax, and that upon our lands and vineyards."
16,5,5,"Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards."
16,5,6,"And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words."
16,5,7,"Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, you exact interest, every one from his brother. And I held a great assembly against them."
16,5,8,"And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold unto the nations; and will you even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer."
16,5,9,"Also I said, It is not good what you do: ought you not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?"
16,5,10,"I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, are lending them money and grain: I pray you, let us stop this charging interest."
16,5,11,"Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the wine, and the oil, that you exact of them."
16,5,12,"Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as you say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise."
16,5,13,"Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performs not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise."
16,5,14,"Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the food allowance of the governor."
16,5,15,"But the former governors that had been before me laid burdens upon the people, and had taken of them food and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bore rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God."
16,5,16,"Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered there unto the work."
16,5,17,"Moreover there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that are about us."
16,5,18,"Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days abundant stores of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the food allowance of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people."
16,5,19,"Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people."
16,6,1,"Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no break left in it; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)"
16,6,2,"That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me harm."
16,6,3,"And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?"
16,6,4,"Yet they sent unto me four times in this way; and I answered them after the same manner."
16,6,5,"Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in the same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;"
16,6,6,"In it was written, It is reported among the nations, and Geshem also says it, that you and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause you build the wall, that you may be their king, according to these words."
16,6,7,"And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together."
16,6,8,"Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as you say, but you invent them out of your own heart."
16,6,9,"For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it will not be done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands."
16,6,10,"Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you; yea, in the night will they come to slay you."
16,6,11,"And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in."
16,6,12,"And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him."
16,6,13,"Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me."
16,6,14,"My God, think you upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear."
16,6,15,"So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days."
16,6,16,"And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was done by our God."
16,6,17,"Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them."
16,6,18,"For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah."
16,6,19,"Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear."
16,7,1,"Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the doorkeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed,"
16,7,2,"That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God more than many."
16,7,3,"And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one at his station, and every one to be opposite his house."
16,7,4,"Now the city was large and great: but the people in it were few, and the houses were not rebuilt."
16,7,5,"And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be registered by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them who came up at the first, and found written in it,"
16,7,6,"These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;"
16,7,7,"Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahemani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this;"
16,7,8,"The children of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy and two."
16,7,9,"The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two."

16,7,60,"All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomonâ€™s servants, were three hundred ninety and two."
16,7,61,"And these were they who went up also from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not prove their fatherâ€™s house, nor their descendants, whether they were of Israel."
16,7,62,"The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two."
16,7,63,"And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite as his wife, and was called after their name."
16,7,64,"These sought their registration among those that were enrolled by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as defiled, put from the priesthood."
16,7,65,"And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till a priest could consult with Urim and Thummim."
16,7,66,"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,"
16,7,67,"Besides their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women."

16,7,69,"Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty donkeys."
16,7,70,"And some of the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priestsâ€™ garments."
16,7,71,"And some of the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses gave to the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand and two hundred minas of silver."
16,7,72,"And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand minas of silver, and threescore and seven priestsâ€™ garments."
16,7,73,"So the priests, and the Levites, and the gatekeepers, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities."
16,8,1,"And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spoke unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel."
16,8,2,"And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month."
16,8,3,"And he read in it facing the square that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law."
16,8,4,"And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddana, Zechariah, and Meshullam."
16,8,5,"And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:"
16,8,6,"And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground."
16,8,7,"Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place."
16,8,8,"So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading."
16,8,9,"And Nehemiah, who is the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law."
16,8,10,"Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet wine, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be you grieved; for the joy of the LORD is your strength."
16,8,11,"So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be you grieved."
16,8,12,"And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great rejoicing, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them."
16,8,13,"And on the second day were gathered together the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law."
16,8,14,"And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:"
16,8,15,"And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mountain, and bring olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of leafy trees, to make booths, as it is written."
16,8,16,"So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the square at the water gate, and in the square at the gate of Ephraim."
16,8,17,"And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness."
16,8,18,"Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance."
16,9,1,"Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and in sackcloth, and earth upon their heads."
16,9,2,"And the descendants of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers."
16,9,3,"And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshiped the LORD their God."
16,9,4,"Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God."
16,9,5,"Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God forever and ever: and blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise."
16,9,6,"You, even you, are LORD alone; you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and you preserve them all; and the host of heaven worships you."
16,9,7,"You are the LORD, the God who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham;"
16,9,8,"And found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his descendants, and have performed your words; for you are righteous:"
16,9,9,"And did see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red sea;"
16,9,10,"And showed signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for you knew that they dealt arrogantly against them. So did you get you a name, as it is this day."
16,9,11,"And you did divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors you threw into the deep, as a stone into the mighty waters."
16,9,12,"Moreover you led them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way in which they should go."
16,9,13,"You came down also upon mount Sinai, and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:"
16,9,14,"And made known unto them your holy sabbath, and commanded them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses your servant:"
16,9,15,"And gave them bread from heaven for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promised them that they should go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them."
16,9,16,"But they and our fathers acted presumptuously, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to your commandments,"
16,9,17,"And refused to obey, neither were mindful of your wonders that you did among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a leader to return to their bondage: but you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsook them not."
16,9,18,"Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God that brought you up out of Egypt, and had worked great provocations;"
16,9,19,"Yet you in your manifold mercies forsook them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go."
16,9,20,"You gave also your good spirit to instruct them, and withheld not your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst."
16,9,21,"Yea, forty years did you sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes grew not old, and their feet swelled not."
16,9,22,"Moreover you gave them kingdoms and nations, and did distribute them even into the corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan."
16,9,23,"Their children also you multiplied as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land, concerning which you had promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it."
16,9,24,"So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would."
16,9,25,"And they took strong cities, and a rich land, and possessed houses full of all goods, cisterns hewed out, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness."
16,9,26,"Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their backs, and slew your prophets who testified against them to turn them to you, and they worked great provocations."
16,9,27,"Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who oppressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto you, you heard them from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies."
16,9,28,"But after they had rest, they did evil again before you: therefore you left them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto you, you heard them from heaven; and many times did you deliver them according to your mercies;"
16,9,29,"And testified against them, that you might bring them again unto your law: yet they acted presumptuously, and hearkened not unto your commandments, but sinned against your judgments, (which if a man does, he shall live in them;) and turned the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear."
16,9,30,"Yet many years did you bear with them, and testified against them by your spirit in your prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore you gave them into the hand of the people of the lands."
16,9,31,"Nevertheless for your great merciesâ€™ sake you did not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God."
16,9,32,"Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before you, that has come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day."
16,9,33,"Yet you are just in all that is brought upon us; for you have done right, but we have done wickedly:"
16,9,34,"Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor hearkened unto your commandments and your testimonies, with which you did testify against them."
16,9,35,"For they have not served you in their kingdom, or in your great goodness that you gave them, or in the large and rich land which you gave before them, neither turned they from their wicked works."
16,9,36,"Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that you gave unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:"
16,9,37,"And it yields much increase unto the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress."
16,9,38,"And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our leaders, Levites, and priests, seal it."
16,10,1,"Now those that sealed it were, Nehemiah, the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,"

16,10,28,"And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Nethinim, and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge, and having understanding;"
16,10,29,"They joined with their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in Godâ€™s law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his ordinances and his statutes;"
16,10,30,"And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons:"
16,10,31,"And if the people of the land bring in wares or any grain on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it from them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would forego the crops of the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt."
16,10,32,"Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;"
16,10,33,"For the showbread, and for the continual grain offering, and for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God."
16,10,34,"And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, according to our fathersâ€™ houses, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law:"
16,10,35,"And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the LORD:"
16,10,36,"Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God:"
16,10,37,"And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our work."
16,10,38,"And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the storehouse."
16,10,39,"For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the grain, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the gatekeepers, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God."
16,11,1,"And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine tenths to dwell in other cities."
16,11,2,"And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem."
16,11,3,"Now these are the leaders of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt everyone in his own possession in their cities; Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of Solomonâ€™s servants."
16,11,4,"And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez;"

16,11,18,"All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four."
16,11,19,"Moreover the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that kept the gates, were a hundred seventy and two."
16,11,20,"And the rest of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance."
16,11,21,"But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinim."

16,11,23,"For it was the kingâ€™s commandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, as required every day."
16,11,24,"And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the kingâ€™s hand in all matters concerning the people."
16,11,25,"And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kiriath-arba, and in its villages, and at Dibon, and in its villages, and at Jekabzeel, and in its villages,"
16,11,26,"And at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Beth-pelet,"
16,11,27,"And at Hazar-shual, and at Beer-sheba, and in its villages,"
16,11,28,"And at Ziklag, and at Meconah, and in its villages,"

16,12,9,"Also Bakbukiah and Unno, their brethren, stood opposite them in the service."
16,12,10,"And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,"
16,12,11,"And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua."

16,12,23,"The sons of Levi, the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib."
16,12,24,"And the heads of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren opposite them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, watch corresponding with watch."
16,12,25,"Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates."
16,12,26,"These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe."
16,12,27,"And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, lyres, and harps."
16,12,28,"And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the countryside round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites;"
16,12,29,"Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had built them villages round about Jerusalem."
16,12,30,"And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall."
16,12,31,"Then I brought up the leaders of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, of which one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the refuse gate:"
16,12,32,"And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the leaders of Judah,"
16,12,33,"And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,"
16,12,34,"Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,"
16,12,35,"And certain of the priestsâ€™ sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:"
16,12,36,"And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe went before them."
16,12,37,"And at the fountain gate, which was opposite them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward."
16,12,38,"And the other company of them that gave thanks went the opposite of them, and I followed them, with half of the people upon the wall, going past the tower of the ovens even unto the broad wall;"
16,12,39,"And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of the hundred, even unto the sheep gate: and they stopped at the gate of the guard."
16,12,40,"So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and half of the rulers with me:"
16,12,41,"And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;"
16,12,42,"And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loudly, with Jezrahiah as their leader."
16,12,43,"Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off."
16,12,44,"And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the stores, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions required by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who ministered."
16,12,45,"And both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son."
16,12,46,"For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a leader of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God."
16,12,47,"And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers, every day their portion: and they set apart holy things for the Levites; and the Levites set them apart for the children of Aaron."
16,13,1,"On that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and in it was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God forever;"
16,13,2,"Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: however our God turned the curse into a blessing."
16,13,3,"Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude."
16,13,4,"And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:"
16,13,5,"And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where previously they stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers; and the offerings of the priests."
16,13,6,"But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:"
16,13,7,"And I came to Jerusalem, and discovered the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God."
16,13,8,"And it grieved me greatly: therefore I cast forth all the household goods of Tobiah out of the chamber."
16,13,9,"Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and there I brought again the articles of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense."
16,13,10,"And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field."
16,13,11,"Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place."
16,13,12,"Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the storehouse."
16,13,13,"And I made treasurers over the storehouse, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their duty was to distribute unto their brethren."
16,13,14,"Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its service."
16,13,15,"In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys; and also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them about the day in which they sold provisions."
16,13,16,"There dwelt men of Tyre also there, who brought fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the people of Judah, and in Jerusalem."
16,13,17,"Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the sabbath day?"
16,13,18,"Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath."
16,13,19,"And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day."
16,13,20,"So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice."
16,13,21,"Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge you before the wall? if you do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath."
16,13,22,"And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of your mercy."
16,13,23,"In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:"
16,13,24,"And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the language of Judah, but according to the language of each people."
16,13,25,"And I contended with them, and pronounced them cursed, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, You shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves."
16,13,26,"Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin."
16,13,27,"Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying foreign wives?"
16,13,28,"And one of the sons of Jehoiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me."
16,13,29,"Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites."
16,13,30,"Thus cleansed I them from everything foreign, and assigned the duties of the priests and the Levites, each one to his service;"
16,13,31,"And provided for the wood offering, at appointed times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good."
17,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus who reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)"
17,1,2,"That in those days, when king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the citadel,"
17,1,3,"In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the powers of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:"
17,1,4,"When he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and fourscore days."
17,1,5,"And when these days were completed, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the citadel, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;"
17,1,6,"Where there were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white and black marble."
17,1,7,"And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being different one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king."
17,1,8,"And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had ordered all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure."
17,1,9,"Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus."
17,1,10,"On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,"
17,1,11,"To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look upon."
17,1,12,"But queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his eunuchs: therefore was the king very angry, and his anger burned within him."
17,1,13,"Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:"
17,1,14,"And next to him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and who sat first in the kingdom;)"
17,1,15,"What shall we do unto queen Vashti according to law, because she has not obeyed the commandment of king Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?"
17,1,16,"And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen has not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus."
17,1,17,"For this deed of the queen shall become known to all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be said, King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not."
17,1,18,"Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, who have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath."
17,1,19,"If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she."
17,1,20,"And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honor, both to great and small."
17,1,21,"And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:"
17,1,22,"For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people."
17,2,1,"After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was abated, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her."
17,2,2,"Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be beautiful young virgins sought out for the king:"
17,2,3,"And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins unto Shushan the citadel, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hegai the king's eunuch, keeper of the women; and let their beautifying ointments be given them:"
17,2,4,"And let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so."
17,2,5,"Now in Shushan the citadel there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;"
17,2,6,"Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away."
17,2,7,"And he had brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took as his own daughter."
17,2,8,"So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the citadel, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women."
17,2,9,"And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her beautifying ointments, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, who were suitable to be given her, out of the king's house: and he moved her and her maidens unto the best place of the house of the women."
17,2,10,"Esther had not revealed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not show it."
17,2,11,"And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her."
17,2,12,"Now when every maiden's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after she had been there twelve months, according to the regulations for the women, (for so were the days of their beautification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfumes, and with other preparations for beautifying women;)"
17,2,13,"Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house."
17,2,14,"In the evening she went, and the next day she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch, who kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name."
17,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her."
17,2,16,"So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign."
17,2,17,"And the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti."
17,2,18,"Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a holiday in all the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the liberality of the king."
17,2,19,"And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate."
17,2,20,"Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai, just as when she was brought up with him."
17,2,21,"In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the door, were angry, and sought to lay hands on king Ahasuerus."
17,2,22,"And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king of it in Mordecai's name."
17,2,23,"And when inquiry was made into the matter, it was confirmed; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king."
17,3,1,"After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him."
17,3,2,"And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and paid homage to Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor paid him homage."
17,3,3,"Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgress you the king's commandment?"
17,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's words would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew."
17,3,5,"And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor paid him homage, then was Haman full of wrath."
17,3,6,"And he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai."
17,3,7,"In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar."
17,3,8,"And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are different from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to tolerate them."
17,3,9,"If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries."
17,3,10,"And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy."
17,3,11,"And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you."
17,3,12,"Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people according to their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring."
17,3,13,"And the letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey."
17,3,14,"The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day."
17,3,15,"The couriers went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the citadel. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed."
17,4,1,"When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;"
17,4,2,"And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth."
17,4,3,"And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes."
17,4,4,"So Esther's maids and her eunuchs came and told it to her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent garments to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not."
17,4,5,"Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend to her, and gave him a command concerning Mordecai, to learn what it was, and why it was."
17,4,6,"So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate."
17,4,7,"And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them."
17,4,8,"Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people."
17,4,9,"And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai."
17,4,10,"Again Esther spoke unto Hathach, and gave him command concerning Mordecai;"
17,4,11,"All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days."
17,4,12,"And they told to Mordecai Esther's words."
17,4,13,"Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not to yourself that you shall escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews."
17,4,14,"For if you altogether hold your peace at this time, then shall relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but you and your father's house shall be destroyed: and who knows whether you are come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
17,4,15,"Then Esther told them to return Mordecai this answer,"
17,4,16,"Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish."
17,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him."
17,5,1,"Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, opposite the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, opposite the entrance of the house."
17,5,2,"And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter."
17,5,3,"Then said the king unto her, What do you wish, queen Esther? and what is your request? it shall be even given you to the half of the kingdom."
17,5,4,"And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him."
17,5,5,"Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared."
17,5,6,"And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is your petition? and it shall be granted you: and what is your request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."
17,5,7,"Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;"
17,5,8,"If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said."
17,5,9,"Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor trembled before him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai."
17,5,10,"Nevertheless Haman restrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife."
17,5,11,"And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king."
17,5,12,"Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and tomorrow I am invited unto her also with the king."
17,5,13,"Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."
17,5,14,"Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak you unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go you in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made."
17,6,1,"On that night the king could not sleep, and he commanded to be brought the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king."
17,6,2,"And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on king Ahasuerus."
17,6,3,"And the king said, What honor and dignity has been bestowed upon Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him."
17,6,4,"And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king's house, to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him."
17,6,5,"And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in."
17,6,6,"So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?"
17,6,7,"And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,"
17,6,8,"Let the royal robes be brought which the king has worn, and the horse that the king rides upon, and the royal crown which is set upon his head:"
17,6,9,"And let the robes and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man with whom the king delights to honor, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor."
17,6,10,"Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sits at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that you have spoken."
17,6,11,"Then took Haman the robes and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delights to honor."
17,6,12,"And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hastened to his house mourning, and having his head covered."
17,6,13,"And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the descendants of the Jews, before whom you have begun to fall, you shall not prevail against him, but shall surely fall before him."
17,6,14,"And while they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs came, and hastened to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared."
17,7,1,"So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen."
17,7,2,"And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is your petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted you: and what is your request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom."
17,7,3,"Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:"
17,7,4,"For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I would have held my tongue, although the enemy could never compensate for the king's loss."
17,7,5,"Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that dares presume in his heart to do so?"
17,7,6,"And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen."
17,7,7,"And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king."
17,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed on which Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face."
17,7,9,"And Harbona, one of the eunuchs, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, stands in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon."
17,7,10,"So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath abated."
17,8,1,"On that day did king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her."
17,8,2,"And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman."
17,8,3,"And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his plot that he had devised against the Jews."
17,8,4,"Then the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,"
17,8,5,"And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seems right before the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces:"
17,8,6,"For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?"
17,8,7,"Then king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews."
17,8,8,"Write you also for the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse."
17,8,9,"Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to its own writing, and unto every people according to their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language."
17,8,10,"And he wrote in king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by couriers on horseback, and riding on royal horses bred from swift horses:"
17,8,11,"By these the king granted the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together, and to defend their lives, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the forces of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and women, and to take their possessions for a spoil,"
17,8,12,"Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar."
17,8,13,"The copy of the writing for a command to be given in every province was published unto all people, so that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies."
17,8,14,"So the couriers that rode upon royal horses went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's command. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace."
17,8,15,"And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad."
17,8,16,"The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor."
17,8,17,"And in every province, and in every city, wherever the king's command and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them."
17,9,1,"Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's command and his decree drew near to be executed, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)"
17,9,2,"The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their harm: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people."
17,9,3,"And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and officials of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them."
17,9,4,"For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai grew greater and greater."
17,9,5,"Thus the Jews defeated all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them."
17,9,6,"And in Shushan the citadel the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men."
17,9,7,"And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,"
17,9,8,"And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,"
17,9,9,"And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vaizatha,"
17,9,10,"The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, they killed; but on the spoil they laid not their hand."
17,9,11,"On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the citadel was brought before the king."
17,9,12,"And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the citadel, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is your petition? and it shall be granted you: or what is your request further? and it shall be done."
17,9,13,"Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows."
17,9,14,"And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons."
17,9,15,"For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men at Shushan; but on the spoil they laid not their hand."
17,9,16,"But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and defended their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and killed of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the spoil,"
17,9,17,"On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
17,9,18,"But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness."
17,9,19,"Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending presents one to another."
17,9,20,"And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, both near and far,"
17,9,21,"To establish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,"
17,9,22,"As the days on which the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feast"
17,9,23,"And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;"
17,9,24,"Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;"
17,9,25,"But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked plot, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows."
17,9,26,"Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,"
17,9,27,"The Jews ordained, and took upon themselves, and upon their descendants, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to what was written, and according to their appointed time every year;"
17,9,28,"And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fall into disuse among the Jews, nor the memory of them perish from their descendants."
17,9,29,"Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter about Purim."
17,9,30,"And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,"
17,9,31,"To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their descendants, concerning the matters of the fastings and their lamentations."
17,9,32,"And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book."
17,10,1,"And king Ahasuerus imposed tribute upon the land, and upon the coastlands of the sea."
17,10,2,"And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?"
17,10,3,"For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brethren, seeking the welfare of his people, and speaking peace to all his countrymen."
18,1,1,"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one that feared God, and turned away from evil."
18,1,2,"And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters."
18,1,3,"His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east."
18,1,4,"And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one on his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them."
18,1,5,"And it was so, when the days of their feasting were finished, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually."
18,1,6,"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them."
18,1,7,"And the LORD said unto Satan,"
18,1,8,"And the LORD said unto Satan,"
18,1,9,"Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?"
18,1,10,"Have not you made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has on every side? you have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions are increased in the land."
18,1,11,"But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face."
18,1,12,"And the LORD said unto Satan,"
18,1,13,"And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brotherâ€™s house:"
18,1,14,"And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them:"
18,1,15,"And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone am escaped to tell you."
18,1,16,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God has fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone am escaped to tell you."
18,1,17,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone am escaped to tell you."
18,1,18,"While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brotherâ€™s house:"
18,1,19,"And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I alone am escaped to tell you."
18,1,20,"Then Job arose, and tore his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshiped,"
18,1,21,"And said, Naked came I out of my motherâ€™s womb, and naked shall I return there: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."
18,1,22,"In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God with wrong."
18,2,1,"Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD."
18,2,2,"And the LORD said unto Satan,"
18,2,3,"And the LORD said unto Satan,"
18,2,4,"And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man has will he give for his life."
18,2,5,"But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face."
18,2,6,"And the LORD said unto Satan,"
18,2,7,"So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot unto the crown of his head."
18,2,8,"And he took himself a potsherd to scrape himself with; and he sat down among the ashes."
18,2,9,"Then said his wife unto him, Do you still retain your integrity? curse God, and die."
18,2,10,"But he said unto her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips."
18,2,11,"Now when Jobâ€™s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him."
18,2,12,"And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they tore every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven."
18,2,13,"So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great."
18,3,1,"After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day."
18,3,2,"And Job spoke, and said,"
18,3,3,"Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a male child conceived."
18,3,4,"Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it."
18,3,5,"Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it."
18,3,6,"As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months."
18,3,7,"Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come into it."
18,3,8,"Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to arouse leviathan."
18,3,9,"Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:"
18,3,10,"Because it shut not up the doors of my motherâ€™s womb, nor hid sorrow from my eyes."
18,3,11,"Why died I not from the womb? why did I not expire when I came out of the womb?"
18,3,12,"Why did the knees receive me? or why the breasts that I should nurse?"
18,3,13,"For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then would I have been at rest,"
18,3,14,"With kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;"
18,3,15,"Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:"
18,3,16,"Or as a hidden untimely birth, I had not been; as infants who never saw light."
18,3,17,"There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary are at rest."
18,3,18,"There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor."
18,3,19,"The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master."
18,3,20,"Therefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;"
18,3,21,"Who long for death, but it comes not; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures;"
18,3,22,"Who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?"
18,3,23,"Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God has hedged in?"
18,3,24,"For my sighing comes before I eat, and my groanings are poured out like the waters."
18,3,25,"For the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me, and that which I was afraid of has come unto me."
18,3,26,"I was not at ease, neither had I quiet, neither was I at rest; yet trouble came."
18,4,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,"
18,4,2,"If we venture to converse with you, will you be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?"
18,4,3,"Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands."
18,4,4,"Your words have upheld him that was falling, and you have strengthened the feeble knees."
18,4,5,"But now it is come upon you, and you faint; it touches you, and you are troubled."
18,4,6,"Is not this your fear, your confidence, your hope, and the uprightness of your ways?"
18,4,7,"Remember, I pray you, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?"
18,4,8,"Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same."
18,4,9,"By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed."
18,4,10,"The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken."
18,4,11,"The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the strong lionâ€™s whelps are scattered abroad."
18,4,12,"Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a whisper of it."
18,4,13,"In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,"
18,4,14,"Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake."
18,4,15,"Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:"
18,4,16,"It stood still, but I could not discern its form: an image was before my eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,"
18,4,17,"Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?"
18,4,18,"Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:"
18,4,19,"How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth?"
18,4,20,"They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish forever without any regarding it."
18,4,21,"Does not their excellence which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom."
18,5,1,"Call now, if there be any that will answer you; and to which of the holy ones will you turn?"
18,5,2,"For wrath kills the foolish man, and envy slays the simple one."
18,5,3,"I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation."
18,5,4,"His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them."
18,5,5,"Whose harvest the hungry eats up, and takes it even out of the thorns, and the robber swallows up their wealth."
18,5,6,"For affliction comes not forth from the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground;"
18,5,7,"Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward."
18,5,8,"I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:"
18,5,9,"Who does great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number:"
18,5,10,"Who gives rain upon the earth, and sends waters upon the fields:"
18,5,11,"To set up on high those that are low; that those who mourn may be lifted to safety."
18,5,12,"He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their plans."
18,5,13,"He takes the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the cunning is quickly ended."
18,5,14,"They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night."
18,5,15,"But he saves the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty."
18,5,16,"So the poor has hope, and injustice shuts her mouth."
18,5,17,"Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects: therefore despise not the chastening of the Almighty:"
18,5,18,"For he bruises, and binds up: he wounds, and his hands make whole."
18,5,19,"He shall deliver you in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch you."
18,5,20,"In famine he shall redeem you from death: and in war from the power of the sword."
18,5,21,"You shall be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes."
18,5,22,"At destruction and famine you shall laugh: neither shall you be afraid of the beasts of the earth."
18,5,23,"For you shall be in covenant with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you."
18,5,24,"And you shall know that your tabernacle shall be in peace; and you shall visit your habitation, and shall find nothing amiss."
18,5,25,"You shall know also that your descendants shall be many, and your offspring as the grass of the earth."
18,5,26,"You shall come to your grave in a full age, like a shock of grain comes in in its season."
18,5,27,"Lo this, we have searched it out, so it is; hear it, and know you it for your good."
18,6,1,"But Job answered and said,"
18,6,2,"Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!"
18,6,3,"For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up."
18,6,4,"For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison thereof drinks up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me."
18,6,5,"Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass? or the ox lows over its fodder?"
18,6,6,"Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?"
18,6,7,"The things that my soul refused to touch are as loathsome food to me."
18,6,8,"Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!"
18,6,9,"Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!"
18,6,10,"Then should I still have comfort; yea, I would exult myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One."
18,6,11,"What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is my end, that I should prolong my life?"
18,6,12,"Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of bronze?"
18,6,13,"Is not my help within me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?"
18,6,14,"To him that is afflicted pity should be shown from his friend; even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty."
18,6,15,"My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks that pass away;"
18,6,16,"Which are black by reason of the ice, and in which the snow is hid:"
18,6,17,"At what time they become warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they vanish out of their place."
18,6,18,"The paths of their way turn aside; they go nowhere, and perish."
18,6,19,"The caravans of Tema looked, the travelers of Sheba waited for them."
18,6,20,"They were disappointed because they had confidence; they came there, and were confused."
18,6,21,"For now you are nothing; you see my terror, and are afraid."
18,6,22,"Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?"
18,6,23,"Or, Deliver me from the enemyâ€™s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?"
18,6,24,"Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand how I have erred."
18,6,25,"How forceful are right words! but what does your arguing prove?"
18,6,26,"Do you intend to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?"
18,6,27,"Yea, you overwhelm the fatherless, and you dig a pit for your friend."
18,6,28,"Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie."
18,6,29,"Return, I pray you, let it not be injustice; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it."
18,6,30,"Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?"
18,7,1,"Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of a hireling?"
18,7,2,"As a servant earnestly desires the shadow, and as a hireling looks for the reward of his work:"
18,7,3,"So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me."
18,7,4,"When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day."
18,7,5,"My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome."
18,7,6,"My days are swifter than a weaverâ€™s shuttle, and are spent without hope."
18,7,7,"O remember that my life is a breath: my eye shall no more see good."
18,7,8,"The eye of him that has seen me shall see me no more: your eyes are upon me, and I am not."
18,7,9,"As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away: so he that goes down to the grave shall come up no more."
18,7,10,"He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more."
18,7,11,"Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul."
18,7,12,"Am I a sea, or a sea monster, that you set a watch over me?"
18,7,13,"When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;"
18,7,14,"Then you scare me with dreams, and terrify me through visions:"
18,7,15,"So that my soul chooses strangling, and death rather than my life."
18,7,16,"I loathe it; I would not live always: let me alone; for my days are vanity."
18,7,17,"What is man, that you should magnify him? and that you should set your heart upon him?"
18,7,18,"And that you should visit him every morning, and test him every moment?"
18,7,19,"How long will you not look away from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?"
18,7,20,"I have sinned; what shall I do unto you, O you preserver of men? why have you set me as a mark against you, so that I am a burden to myself?"
18,7,21,"And why do you not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and you shall seek me in the morning, but I shall not be."
18,8,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
18,8,2,"How long will you speak these things? and how long shall the words of your mouth be like a strong wind?"
18,8,3,"Does God pervert judgment? or does the Almighty pervert justice?"
18,8,4,"If your children have sinned against him, and he has cast them away for their transgression;"
18,8,5,"If you would seek unto God early, and make your supplication to the Almighty;"
18,8,6,"If you were pure and upright; surely now he would awake for you, and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous."
18,8,7,"Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end should greatly increase."
18,8,8,"For inquire, I pray you, of the former age, and prepare yourself to the findings of their fathers:"
18,8,9,"(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)"
18,8,10,"Shall not they teach you, and tell you, and utter words out of their heart?"
18,8,11,"Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh? can the reeds grow without water?"
18,8,12,"While it is yet green, and not cut down, it withers before any other plant."
18,8,13,"So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocriteâ€™s hope shall perish:"
18,8,14,"Whose confidence shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spiderâ€™s web."
18,8,15,"He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure."
18,8,16,"He grows green in the sun, and his branch shoots forth in his garden."
18,8,17,"His roots are wrapped about the stone heap, and looks for a place in the stones."
18,8,18,"If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, I have not seen you."
18,8,19,"Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow."
18,8,20,"Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man, neither will he help the evil doers:"
18,8,21,"Till he fills your mouth with laughing, and your lips with rejoicing."
18,8,22,"They that hate you shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked will come to nothing."
18,9,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,9,2,"I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just before God?"
18,9,3,"If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand."
18,9,4,"He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who has hardened himself against him, and has prospered?"
18,9,5,"Who removes the mountains, and they know not: who overturns them in his anger."
18,9,6,"Who shakes the earth out of its place, and the pillars thereof tremble."
18,9,7,"Who commands the sun, and it rises not; and seals up the stars."
18,9,8,"Who alone spreads out the heavens, and treads upon the waves of the sea."
18,9,9,"Who makes the Bear, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south."
18,9,10,"Who does great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number."
18,9,11,"Lo, he goes by me, and I see him not: he passes on also, but I perceive him not."
18,9,12,"Behold, he takes away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What do you?"
18,9,13,"If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do bow before him."
18,9,14,"How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?"
18,9,15,"For, though I were righteous, yet could I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge."
18,9,16,"If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice."
18,9,17,"For he breaks me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause."
18,9,18,"He will not permit me to take my breath, but fills me with bitterness."
18,9,19,"If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of justice, who shall set me a time to plead?"
18,9,20,"If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am blameless, it shall also prove me perverse."
18,9,21,"Though I were blameless, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life."
18,9,22,"This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroys the blameless and the wicked."
18,9,23,"If the scourge slays suddenly, he will laugh at the plight of the innocent."
18,9,24,"The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covers the faces of its judges; if not he, who then is it?"
18,9,25,"Now my days are swifter than a runner: they flee away, they see no good."
18,9,26,"They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hastens to the prey."
18,9,27,"If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:"
18,9,28,"I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not hold me innocent."
18,9,29,"If I am wicked, why then labor I in vain?"
18,9,30,"If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands ever so clean;"
18,9,31,"Yet shall you plunge me in the ditch, and my own clothes shall abhor me."
18,9,32,"For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in trial."
18,9,33,"Neither is there any mediator between us, that might lay his hand upon us both."
18,9,34,"Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:"
18,9,35,"Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me."
18,10,1,"My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul."
18,10,2,"I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; show me why you contend with me."
18,10,3,"Is it good unto you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and smile upon the counsel of the wicked?"
18,10,4,"Have you eyes of flesh? or see you as man sees?"
18,10,5,"Are your days as the days of man? are your years as manâ€™s days,"
18,10,6,"That you inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?"
18,10,7,"You know that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of your hand."
18,10,8,"Your hands have made me and fashioned me together totally; yet you do destroy me."
18,10,9,"Remember, I beseech you, that you have made me as the clay; and will you bring me into dust again?"
18,10,10,"Have you not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?"
18,10,11,"You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and have knit me together with bones and sinews."
18,10,12,"You have granted me life and favor, and your care has preserved my spirit."
18,10,13,"And these things have you hid in your heart: I know that this is with you."
18,10,14,"If I sin, then you mark me, and you will not acquit me from my iniquity."
18,10,15,"If I am wicked, woe unto me; and if I am righteous, yet can I not lift up my head. I am full of disgrace; therefore see my affliction;"
18,10,16,"For it increases. You hunt me as a fierce lion: and again you show yourself awesome against me."
18,10,17,"You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your indignation upon me; changes and war are ever with me."
18,10,18,"Why then have you brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had died, and no eye had seen me!"
18,10,19,"I would have been as though I had not been; I would have been carried from the womb to the grave."
18,10,20,"Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,"
18,10,21,"Before I go where I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;"
18,10,22,"A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness."
18,11,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
18,11,2,"Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?"
18,11,3,"Should your lies make men hold their peace? and when you mock, shall no man make you ashamed?"
18,11,4,"For you have said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in your eyes."
18,11,5,"But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you;"
18,11,6,"And that he would show you the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves."
18,11,7,"Can you by searching find out God? can you find out the limits of the Almighty?"
18,11,8,"It is as high as heaven; what can you do? deeper than Sheol; what can you know?"
18,11,9,"The measure of it is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea."
18,11,10,"If he cuts off, and shuts up, or gathers together, then who can hinder him?"
18,11,11,"For he knows vain men: he sees wickedness also; will he not then consider it?"
18,11,12,"For a vain man will be wise, when a man is born a wild donkeyâ€™s colt."
18,11,13,"If you prepare your heart, and stretch out your hands toward him;"
18,11,14,"If iniquity be in your hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in your tents."
18,11,15,"For then shall you lift up your face without spot; yea, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:"
18,11,16,"Because you shall forget your misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:"
18,11,17,"And your life shall be brighter than the noonday; you shall shine forth, you shall be as the morning."
18,11,18,"And you shall be secure, because there is hope; yea, you shall dig about you, and take your rest in safety."
18,11,19,"Also you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; yea, many shall entreat your favor."
18,11,20,"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as one dying."
18,12,1,"And Job answered and said,"
18,12,2,"No doubt you are the people, and wisdom shall die with you."
18,12,3,"But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knows not such things as these?"
18,12,4,"I am as one mocked of his neighbor, who calls upon God, and he answers him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn."
18,12,5,"He that is ready to slip with his feet is like a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease."
18,12,6,"The tents of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God brings abundantly."
18,12,7,"But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach you; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell you:"
18,12,8,"Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you: and the fish of the sea shall declare unto you."
18,12,9,"Who knows not among all these that the hand of the LORD has done this?"
18,12,10,"In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind."
18,12,11,"Does not the ear test words? and the mouth taste its food?"
18,12,12,"With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding."
18,12,13,"With him is wisdom and strength, he has counsel and understanding."
18,12,14,"Behold, he breaks down, and it cannot be built again: he shuts up a man, and there can be no opening."
18,12,15,"Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up: also he sends them out, and they overturn the earth."
18,12,16,"With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his."
18,12,17,"He leads counselors away plundered, and makes the judges fools."
18,12,18,"He looses the bonds of kings, and girds their loins with a waistband."
18,12,19,"He leads princes away plundered, and overthrows the mighty."
18,12,20,"He takes away the speech of the trustworthy, and takes away the understanding of the aged."
18,12,21,"He pours contempt upon princes, and weakens the strength of the mighty."
18,12,22,"He uncovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death."
18,12,23,"He increases the nations, and destroys them: he enlarges the nations, and leads them away."
18,12,24,"He takes away the heart of the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way."
18,12,25,"They grope in the dark without light, and he makes them to stagger like a drunken man."
18,13,1,"Lo, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it."
18,13,2,"What you know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you."
18,13,3,"Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God."
18,13,4,"But you are forgers of lies, you are all physicians of no value."
18,13,5,"O that you would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom."
18,13,6,"Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips."
18,13,7,"Will you speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?"
18,13,8,"Will you accept his person? will you contend for God?"
18,13,9,"Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocks another, do you so mock him?"
18,13,10,"He will surely reprove you, if you do secretly show partiality."
18,13,11,"Shall not his excellence make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?"
18,13,12,"Your proverbs are like unto ashes, your defenses are defenses of clay."
18,13,13,"Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will."
18,13,14,"Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?"
18,13,15,"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will defend my own ways before him."
18,13,16,"He also shall be my salvation: for a hypocrite shall not come before him."
18,13,17,"Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears."
18,13,18,"Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be justified."
18,13,19,"Who is he that will contend with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall die."
18,13,20,"Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from you."
18,13,21,"Withdraw your hand far from me: and let not your dread make me afraid."
18,13,22,"Then call, and I will answer: or let me speak, and you answer me."
18,13,23,"How many are my iniquities and sins? make me know my transgression and my sin."
18,13,24,"Why hide you your face, and hold me for your enemy?"
18,13,25,"Will you break a leaf driven to and fro? and will you pursue the dry stubble?"
18,13,26,"For you write bitter things against me, and make me possess the iniquities of my youth."
18,13,27,"You put my feet also in the stocks, and watch closely all my paths; you set a bound to the soles of my feet."
18,13,28,"And he, like a rotten thing, consumes, as a garment that is moth-eaten."
18,14,1,"Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble."
18,14,2,"He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down: he flees also as a shadow, and continues not."
18,14,3,"And do you open your eyes upon such a one, and bring me into judgment with you?"
18,14,4,"Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? no one."
18,14,5,"Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with you, you have appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;"
18,14,6,"Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day."
18,14,7,"For there is hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender shoots thereof will not cease."
18,14,8,"Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stump dies in the ground;"
18,14,9,"Yet at the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth branches like a plant."
18,14,10,"But man dies, and wastes away: yea, man expires, and where is he?"
18,14,11,"As the waters fail from the sea, and the river decays and dries up:"
18,14,12,"So man lies down, and rises not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep."
18,14,13,"O that you would hide me in the grave, that you would conceal me, until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!"
18,14,14,"If a man dies, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change comes."
18,14,15,"You shall call, and I will answer you: you will have a desire to the work of your hands."
18,14,16,"For now you number my steps: do not watch over my sin."
18,14,17,"My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and you sew up my iniquity."
18,14,18,"And surely the mountain falling, comes to nothing, and the rock is removed out of its place."
18,14,19,"The waters wear the stones: you wash away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and you destroy the hope of man."
18,14,20,"You prevail forever against him, and he passes: you change his countenance, and send him away."
18,14,21,"His sons come to honor, and he knows it not; and they are brought low, but he perceives it not of them."
18,14,22,"But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn."
18,15,1,"Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,"
18,15,2,"Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?"
18,15,3,"Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches with which he can do no good?"
18,15,4,"Yea, you cast off fear, and restrain prayer before God."
18,15,5,"For your mouth utters your iniquity, and you choose the tongue of the crafty."
18,15,6,"Your own mouth condemns you, and not I: yea, your own lips testify against you."
18,15,7,"Are you the first man that was born? or were you made before the hills?"
18,15,8,"Have you heard the council of God? and do you limit wisdom to yourself?"
18,15,9,"What know you, that we know not? what understand you, which is not in us?"
18,15,10,"With us are both the gray headed and very aged men, much older than your father."
18,15,11,"Are the consolations of God too small for you? on the word that deals gently with you?"
18,15,12,"Why does your heart carry you away? and what do your eyes wink at,"
18,15,13,"That you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?"
18,15,14,"What is man, that he should be clean? and he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?"
18,15,15,"Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight."
18,15,16,"How much more abominable and filthy is man, who drinks iniquity like water?"
18,15,17,"I will show you, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;"
18,15,18,"Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:"
18,15,19,"Unto whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them."
18,15,20,"The wicked man travails with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden for the oppressor."
18,15,21,"A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him."
18,15,22,"He believes not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for by the sword."
18,15,23,"He wanders abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand."
18,15,24,"Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready for battle."
18,15,25,"For he stretches out his hand against God, and strengthens himself against the Almighty."
18,15,26,"He runs stubbornly against him, with his heavily embossed shield."
18,15,27,"Because he covers his face with his fatness, and makes heavy fat on his waist."
18,15,28,"And he dwells in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabits, which are ready to become heaps."
18,15,29,"He shall not be rich, neither shall his wealth continue, neither shall he overspread the earth with it."
18,15,30,"He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away."
18,15,31,"Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for futility shall be his reward."
18,15,32,"It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green."
18,15,33,"He shall shake off his unripe grapes like the vine, and shall cast off his blossom like the olive."
18,15,34,"For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery."
18,15,35,"They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their heart prepares deceit."
18,16,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,16,2,"I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are you all."
18,16,3,"Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldens you that you answer?"
18,16,4,"I also could speak as you do: if your soul were in my soulâ€™s place, I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you."
18,16,5,"But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips would relieve your grief."
18,16,6,"Though I speak, my grief is not relieved: and though I forbear, how am I eased?"
18,16,7,"But now he has made me weary: you have made desolate all my company."
18,16,8,"And you have filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me bears witness to my face."
18,16,9,"He tears me in his wrath, who hates me: he gnashes upon me with his teeth; my enemy sharpens his eyes upon me."
18,16,10,"They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me."
18,16,11,"God has delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked."
18,16,12,"I was at ease, but he has broken me asunder: he has also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark."
18,16,13,"His archers surround me, he slashes my kidneys asunder, and does not spare; he pours out my gall upon the ground."
18,16,14,"He breaks me with breach upon breach, he runs upon me like a warrior."
18,16,15,"I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and laid my strength in the dust."
18,16,16,"My face is foul from weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;"
18,16,17,"Not for any violence in my hands: also my prayer is pure."
18,16,18,"O earth, cover not my blood, and let my cry have no place."
18,16,19,"Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high."
18,16,20,"My friends scorn me: but my eye pours out tears unto God."
18,16,21,"O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleads for his neighbor!"
18,16,22,"When a few years have come, then I shall go the way where I shall not return."
18,17,1,"My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the grave is ready for me."
18,17,2,"Are there not mockers with me? and does not my eye continue in their provocation?"
18,17,3,"Lay down a surety for me with you; who is he that will give surety for me?"
18,17,4,"For you have hidden their heart from understanding: therefore shall you not exalt them."
18,17,5,"He that speaks flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail."
18,17,6,"He has made me also a byword of the people; and I was as one before whom men spit."
18,17,7,"My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are like a shadow."
18,17,8,"Upright men shall be astonished at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite."
18,17,9,"The righteous also shall hold to his way, and he that has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger."
18,17,10,"But as for you all, do you return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you."
18,17,11,"My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart."
18,17,12,"They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness."
18,17,13,"If I wait, the grave is my house: I have made my bed in the darkness."
18,17,14,"I have said to corruption, You are my father: to the worm, You are my mother, and my sister."
18,17,15,"And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?"
18,17,16,"They shall go down to the gates of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust."
18,18,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
18,18,2,"How long will it be before you make an end of words? consider, and afterwards we will speak."
18,18,3,"Why are we counted as beasts, and regarded as vile in your sight?"
18,18,4,"He tears himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for you? and shall the rock be removed out of its place?"
18,18,5,"Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the flame of his fire shall not shine."
18,18,6,"The light shall be dark in his tent, and his lamp shall be put out with him."
18,18,7,"The steps of his strength shall be shortened, and his own counsel shall cast him down."
18,18,8,"For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks upon a snare."
18,18,9,"The trap shall take him by the heel, and a snare shall lay hold of him."
18,18,10,"The noose is laid for him on the ground, and a trap for him in the way."
18,18,11,"Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet."
18,18,12,"His strength shall be hunger-bitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side."
18,18,13,"It shall devour patches of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength."
18,18,14,"His confidence shall be rooted out of his tent, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors."
18,18,15,"They shall dwell in his tent, who are none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation."
18,18,16,"His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off."
18,18,17,"His memory shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street."
18,18,18,"He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world."
18,18,19,"He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings."
18,18,20,"They that come after him shall be astounded at his day, as they that went before were frightened."
18,18,21,"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knows not God."
18,19,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,19,2,"How long will you torment my soul, and break me in pieces with words?"
18,19,3,"These ten times have you reproached me: you are not ashamed that you have wronged me."
18,19,4,"And if indeed I have erred, my error remains with myself."
18,19,5,"If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:"
18,19,6,"Know now that God has overthrown me, and has compassed me with his net."
18,19,7,"Behold, I cry out concerning wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no justice."
18,19,8,"He has fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness in my paths."
18,19,9,"He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head."
18,19,10,"He has destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and my hope has he removed like a tree."
18,19,11,"He has also kindled his wrath against me, and he counts me unto him as one of his enemies."
18,19,12,"His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tent."
18,19,13,"He has put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me."
18,19,14,"My kinsfolk have failed, and my close friends have forgotten me."
18,19,15,"They that dwell in my house, and my maidservants, count me as a stranger: I am an alien in their sight."
18,19,16,"I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I entreated him with my mouth."
18,19,17,"My breath is repulsive to my wife, though I make supplication for the children of my own body."
18,19,18,"Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spoke against me."
18,19,19,"All my close friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved have turned against me."
18,19,20,"My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth."
18,19,21,"Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me."
18,19,22,"Why do you persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?"
18,19,23,"Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!"
18,19,24,"That they were engraved with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever!"
18,19,25,"For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:"
18,19,26,"And though after my skin is thus destroyed, yet in my flesh shall I see God:"
18,19,27,"Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another; though my heart be consumed within me."
18,19,28,"But you should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?"
18,19,29,"Be yourselves afraid of the sword: for wrath brings the punishment of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment."
18,20,1,"Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,"
18,20,2,"Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste."
18,20,3,"I have heard the rebuke of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer."
18,20,4,"Know you not this of old, since man was placed upon the earth,"
18,20,5,"That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?"
18,20,6,"Though his haughtiness mounts up to the heavens, and his head reaches unto the clouds;"
18,20,7,"Yet he shall perish forever like his own refuse: they who have seen him shall say, Where is he?"
18,20,8,"He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night."
18,20,9,"The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him."
18,20,10,"His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods."
18,20,11,"His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust."
18,20,12,"Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;"
18,20,13,"Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:"
18,20,14,"Yet his food in his body is soured, it is the gall of asps within him."
18,20,15,"He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly."
18,20,16,"He shall suck the poison of asps: the viperâ€™s tongue shall slay him."
18,20,17,"He shall not see the rivers, the brooks flowing with honey and butter."
18,20,18,"That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: from the proceeds of business he shall not rejoice."
18,20,19,"Because he has oppressed and has forsaken the poor; because he has violently taken away a house which he built not;"
18,20,20,"Surely he shall not feel quietness in his heart, he shall not save of that which he desired."
18,20,21,"There shall none of his food be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods."
18,20,22,"In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in distress: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him."
18,20,23,"When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating."
18,20,24,"He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of bronze shall strike him through."
18,20,25,"It is drawn, and comes out of the body; yea, the glittering sword comes out of his gall: terrors are upon him."
18,20,26,"All darkness shall be laid up for his treasures: a fire not blown upon shall consume him; it shall go ill with him who is left in his tent."
18,20,27,"The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him."
18,20,28,"The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath."
18,20,29,"This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God."
18,21,1,"But Job answered and said,"
18,21,2,"Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolation."
18,21,3,"Bear with me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on."
18,21,4,"As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?"
18,21,5,"Look at me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth."
18,21,6,"Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling takes hold on my flesh."
18,21,7,"Why do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?"
18,21,8,"Their descendants are established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes."
18,21,9,"Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them."
18,21,10,"Their bull breeds, and fails not; their cow calves, and casts not her calf."
18,21,11,"They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance."
18,21,12,"They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the flute."
18,21,13,"They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave."
18,21,14,"Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of your ways."
18,21,15,"What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?"
18,21,16,"Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
18,21,17,"How often is the lamp of the wicked put out! and how often comes their destruction upon them! God distributes sorrows in his anger."
18,21,18,"They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carries away."
18,21,19,"God lays up his iniquity for his children: he recompenses him, and he shall know it."
18,21,20,"His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty."
18,21,21,"For what pleasure has he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?"
18,21,22,"Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judges those that are on high."
18,21,23,"One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet."
18,21,24,"His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow."
18,21,25,"And another dies in the bitterness of his soul, and never eats with pleasure."
18,21,26,"They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them."
18,21,27,"Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which you wrongfully imagine against me."
18,21,28,"For you say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?"
18,21,29,"Have you not asked them that go by the way? and do you not know their evidences,"
18,21,30,"That the wicked are reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath."
18,21,31,"Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he has done?"
18,21,32,"Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb."
18,21,33,"The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall follow after him, as there are innumerable gone before him."
18,21,34,"How then do you comfort me in vain, seeing in your answers there remains falsehood?"
18,22,1,"Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,"
18,22,2,"Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?"
18,22,3,"Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous? or is it gain to him, that you make your ways blameless?"
18,22,4,"Will he reprove you for fear of you? will he enter with you into judgment?"
18,22,5,"Is not your wickedness great? and your iniquities without end?"
18,22,6,"For you have taken a pledge from your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing."
18,22,7,"You have not given water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry."
18,22,8,"But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honorable man dwelt in it."
18,22,9,"You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken."
18,22,10,"Therefore snares are round about you, and sudden fear troubles you;"
18,22,11,"Or darkness, that you can not see; and abundance of waters cover you."
18,22,12,"Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!"
18,22,13,"And you say, How does God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?"
18,22,14,"Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he sees not; and he walks in the circle of heaven."
18,22,15,"Have you marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?"
18,22,16,"Who were cut down before their time, whose foundation was swept away with a flood:"
18,22,17,"Who said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do to us?"
18,22,18,"Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me."
18,22,19,"The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn."
18,22,20,"Surely our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumes."
18,22,21,"Acquaint now yourself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto you."
18,22,22,"Receive, I pray you, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart."
18,22,23,"If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up, you shall put away iniquity far from your tents."
18,22,24,"Then shall you lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks."
18,22,25,"Yea, the Almighty shall be your defense, and you shall have plenty of silver."
18,22,26,"For then shall you have your delight in the Almighty, and shall lift up your face unto God."
18,22,27,"You shall make your prayer unto him, and he shall hear you, and you shall pay your vows."
18,22,28,"You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established for you: and the light shall shine upon your ways."
18,22,29,"When men are cast down, then you shall say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person."
18,22,30,"He shall deliver the innocent man: and he is delivered by the pureness of your hands."
18,23,1,"Then Job answered and said,"
18,23,2,"Even today is my complaint bitter: my hand is heavy in spite of my groaning."
18,23,3,"Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!"
18,23,4,"I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments."
18,23,5,"I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me."
18,23,6,"Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me."
18,23,7,"There the righteous might reason with him; so should I be delivered forever from my judge."
18,23,8,"Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:"
18,23,9,"On the left hand, where he does work, but I cannot behold him: he hides himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:"
18,23,10,"But he knows the way that I take: when he has tested me, I shall come forth as gold."
18,23,11,"My foot has held fast to his steps, his way have I kept, and not turned aside."
18,23,12,"Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food."
18,23,13,"But he is of one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desires, even that he does."
18,23,14,"For he performs the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him."
18,23,15,"Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him."
18,23,16,"For God makes my heart soft, and the Almighty troubles me:"
18,23,17,"Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither has he covered the darkness from my face."
18,24,1,"Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?"
18,24,2,"Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed on them."
18,24,3,"They drive away the donkey of the fatherless, they take the widowâ€™s ox for a pledge."
18,24,4,"They drive the needy off the road: the poor of the earth hide themselves together."
18,24,5,"Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising early for a prey: the wilderness yields food for them and for their children."
18,24,6,"They reap every one his grain in the field: and they gather the vineyard of the wicked."
18,24,7,"They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold."
18,24,8,"They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter."
18,24,9,"They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge from the poor."
18,24,10,"They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaves from the hungry;"
18,24,11,"Who make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, yet suffer thirst."
18,24,12,"Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded cries out: yet God charges not folly to them."
18,24,13,"They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not its ways, nor abide in its paths."
18,24,14,"The murderer rising with the light kills the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief."
18,24,15,"The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguises his face."
18,24,16,"In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light."
18,24,17,"For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one recognizes them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death."
18,24,18,"They are swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: no one turns into the way of the vineyards."
18,24,19,"Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so does the grave those who have sinned."
18,24,20,"The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree."
18,24,21,"He evil treats the barren that bears not: and does not good to the widow."
18,24,22,"He draws also the mighty with his power: he rises up, but no man is sure of life."
18,24,23,"Though it be given him to be in safety, he rests; yet his eyes are upon their ways."
18,24,24,"They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all others, and cut off as the tops of the ears of grain."
18,24,25,"And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech worth nothing?"
18,25,1,"Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,"
18,25,2,"Dominion and fear are with him, he makes peace in his high places."
18,25,3,"Is there any number to his armies? and upon whom does not his light arise?"
18,25,4,"How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?"
18,25,5,"Behold even to the moon, and it shines not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight."
18,25,6,"How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, who is a worm?"
18,26,1,"But Job answered and said,"
18,26,2,"How have you helped him that is without power? how save you the arm that has no strength?"
18,26,3,"How have you counseled him that has no wisdom? and how have you plentifully declared the thing as it is?"
18,26,4,"To whom have you uttered words? and whose spirit came from you?"
18,26,5,"Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof."
18,26,6,"Sheol is naked before him, and destruction has no covering."
18,26,7,"He stretches out the north over the empty place, and hangs the earth upon nothing."
18,26,8,"He binds up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not torn under them."
18,26,9,"He holds back the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud upon it."
18,26,10,"He has drawn a circle on the waters at the boundary where the day and night come together."
18,26,11,"The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke."
18,26,12,"He divides the sea with his power, and by his understanding he strikes through the storm."
18,26,13,"By his spirit he has adorned the heavens; his hand has pierced the fleeing serpent."
18,26,14,"Lo, these are only parts of his ways: and how little a whisper is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?"
18,27,1,"Moreover Job continued his discourse, and said,"
18,27,2,"As God lives, who has taken away my right; and the Almighty, who has made bitter my soul;"
18,27,3,"All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;"
18,27,4,"My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit."
18,27,5,"God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove my integrity from me."
18,27,6,"My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live."
18,27,7,"Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that rises up against me as the unrighteous."
18,27,8,"For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he has gained, when God takes away his soul?"
18,27,9,"Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him?"
18,27,10,"Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?"
18,27,11,"I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal."
18,27,12,"Behold, all you yourselves have seen it; why then are you thus altogether vain?"
18,27,13,"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty."
18,27,14,"If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread."
18,27,15,"Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep."
18,27,16,"Though he heap up silver as the dust, and pile up clothing as the clay;"
18,27,17,"He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver."
18,27,18,"He builds his house like a moth, and like a booth that the keeper makes."
18,27,19,"The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he opens his eyes, and he is not."
18,27,20,"Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest steals him away in the night."
18,27,21,"The east wind carries him away, and he is gone: and as a storm hurls him out of his place."
18,27,22,"For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would scarcely flee out of his hand."
18,27,23,"Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place."
18,28,1,"Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they refine it."
18,28,2,"Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted out of the ore."
18,28,3,"Man sets an end to darkness, and searches out all recesses for ore in darkness, and the shadow of death."
18,28,4,"He breaks open a shaft away from the inhabitants; even in places forgotten of the foot: they are gone away from men, they swing to and fro."
18,28,5,"As for the earth, out of it comes bread: but under it is turned up as it were fire."
18,28,6,"The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it has dust of gold."
18,28,7,"There is a path which no fowl knows, and which the falconâ€™s eye has not seen:"
18,28,8,"The lionâ€™s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it."
18,28,9,"He puts forth his hand upon the flinty rock; he overturns the mountains by the roots."
18,28,10,"He cuts out rivers in the rocks; and his eye sees every precious thing."
18,28,11,"He binds the streams from overflowing; and the thing that is hid brings he forth to light."
18,28,12,"But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?"
18,28,13,"Man knows not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living."
18,28,14,"The deep says, It is not in me: and the sea says, It is not with me."
18,28,15,"It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof."
18,28,16,"It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire."
18,28,17,"The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold."
18,28,18,"No mention shall be made of coral, or of crystal: for the price of wisdom is above rubies."
18,28,19,"The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold."
18,28,20,"From where then comes wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?"
18,28,21,"Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and concealed from the fowls of the air."
18,28,22,"Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame of it with our ears."
18,28,23,"God understands its way, and he knows its place."
18,28,24,"For he looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the whole heaven;"
18,28,25,"To make the weight for the wind; and he apportions the waters by measure."
18,28,26,"When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:"
18,28,27,"Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out."
18,28,28,"And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding."
18,29,1,"Moreover Job continued his discourse, and said,"
18,29,2,"Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;"
18,29,3,"When his lamp shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;"
18,29,4,"As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tent;"
18,29,5,"When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;"
18,29,6,"When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;"
18,29,7,"When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the open square!"
18,29,8,"The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up."
18,29,9,"The princes refrained from talking, and laid their hand on their mouth."
18,29,10,"The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth."
18,29,11,"When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:"
18,29,12,"Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him."
18,29,13,"The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widowâ€™s heart to sing for joy."
18,29,14,"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my justice was as a robe and a turban."
18,29,15,"I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame."
18,29,16,"I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out."
18,29,17,"And I broke the fangs of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth."
18,29,18,"Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand."
18,29,19,"My root was spread out to the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch."
18,29,20,"My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand."
18,29,21,"Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel."
18,29,22,"After my words they spoke not again; and my speech dropped upon them."
18,29,23,"And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain."
18,29,24,"If I mocked them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down."
18,29,25,"I chose out their way, and sat as chief, and dwelt like a king in the army, as one that comforts the mourners."
18,30,1,"But now they that are younger than I hold me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock."
18,30,2,"Yea, how might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom vigor has perished?"
18,30,3,"From want and famine they are gaunt; fleeing of late into the wilderness, desolate and waste."
18,30,4,"Who pick mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their food."
18,30,5,"They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)"
18,30,6,"To dwell in the clefts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks."
18,30,7,"Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together."
18,30,8,"They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth."
18,30,9,"And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword."
18,30,10,"They abhor me, they flee far from me, and hesitate not to spit in my face."
18,30,11,"Because he has loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also cast off restraint before me."
18,30,12,"Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction."
18,30,13,"They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper."
18,30,14,"They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me."
18,30,15,"Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my honor as the wind: and my welfare passes away as a cloud."
18,30,16,"And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me."
18,30,17,"My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest."
18,30,18,"By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it binds me about as the collar of my coat."
18,30,19,"He has cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes."
18,30,20,"I cry unto you, and you do not hear me: I stand up, and you regard me not."
18,30,21,"You have become cruel to me: with your strong hand you oppose yourself against me."
18,30,22,"You lift me up to the wind; you cause me to ride upon it, and spoil my substance."
18,30,23,"For I know that you will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living."
18,30,24,"Yet he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry out in his destruction."
18,30,25,"Did I not weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?"
18,30,26,"When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness."
18,30,27,"My heart is in turmoil, and rests not: the days of affliction confront me."
18,30,28,"I went mourning but not in the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation."
18,30,29,"I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches."
18,30,30,"My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat."
18,30,31,"My harp also is turned to mourning, and my flute into the voice of them that weep."
18,31,1,"I made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I think upon a maiden?"
18,31,2,"For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?"
18,31,3,"Is not destruction to the wicked? and a disaster to the workers of iniquity?"
18,31,4,"Does not he see my ways, and count all my steps?"
18,31,5,"If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot has hastened to deceit;"
18,31,6,"Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity."
18,31,7,"If my step has turned out of the way, and my heart walked after my eyes, and if any spot has cleaved to my hands;"
18,31,8,"Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out."
18,31,9,"If my heart has been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighborâ€™s door;"
18,31,10,"Then let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down upon her."
18,31,11,"For this is a heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges."
18,31,12,"For it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would root out all my increase."
18,31,13,"If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;"
18,31,14,"What then shall I do when God rises up? and when he comes, what shall I answer him?"
18,31,15,"Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?"
18,31,16,"If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;"
18,31,17,"Or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it;"
18,31,18,"(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided him from my motherâ€™s womb;)"
18,31,19,"If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;"
18,31,20,"If his heart has not blessed me, and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;"
18,31,21,"If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw I had help in the gate:"
18,31,22,"Then let my arm fall from my shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from its socket."
18,31,23,"For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his majesty I could not endure."
18,31,24,"If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, You are my confidence;"
18,31,25,"If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much;"
18,31,26,"If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon moving in brightness;"
18,31,27,"And my heart has been secretly enticed, or my mouth has kissed my hand:"
18,31,28,"This also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above."
18,31,29,"If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:"
18,31,30,"Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul."
18,31,31,"If the men of my tent have not, Oh that we had of his meat! we cannot be satisfied."
18,31,32,"The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveler."
18,31,33,"If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom:"
18,31,34,"Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?"
18,31,35,"Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that my adversary had written a book."
18,31,36,"Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me."
18,31,37,"I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him."
18,31,38,"If my land cries against me, and its furrows likewise complain;"
18,31,39,"If I have eaten its fruit without payment, or have caused its owners to lose their life:"
18,31,40,"Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and weeds instead of barley. The words of Job are ended."
18,32,1,"So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes."
18,32,2,"Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath aroused, because he justified himself rather than God."
18,32,3,"Also against his three friends was his wrath aroused, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job."
18,32,4,"Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were older than he."
18,32,5,"When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was aroused."
18,32,6,"And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and you are very old; therefore I was afraid, and dared not show you my opinion."
18,32,7,"I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom."
18,32,8,"But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty gives him understanding."
18,32,9,"Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand justice."
18,32,10,"Therefore I say, Hearken to me; I also will show my opinion."
18,32,11,"Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, while you searched out what to say."
18,32,12,"Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:"
18,32,13,"Lest you should say, We have found out wisdom: God vanquishes him, not man."
18,32,14,"Now he has not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches."
18,32,15,"They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking."
18,32,16,"When I had waited, (for they spoke not, but stood still, and answered no more;)"
18,32,17,"I said, I will answer also my part, I also will show my opinion."
18,32,18,"For I am full of words, the spirit within me constrains me."
18,32,19,"Behold, my belly is as wine which has no vent; it is ready to burst like new wineskins."
18,32,20,"I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer."
18,32,21,"Let me not, I pray you, accept any manâ€™s person, neither let me give flattery unto man."
18,32,22,"For I know not how to give flattery; in so doing my maker would soon take me away."
18,33,1,"Therefore, Job, I pray you, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words."
18,33,2,"Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue has spoken in my mouth."
18,33,3,"My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly."
18,33,4,"The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty has given me life."
18,33,5,"If you can answer me, set your words in order before me, stand up."
18,33,6,"Behold, I am according to your wish in Godâ€™s stead: I also am formed out of the clay."
18,33,7,"Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon you."
18,33,8,"Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of your words, saying,"
18,33,9,"I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me."
18,33,10,"Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me for his enemy,"
18,33,11,"He puts my feet in the stocks, he marks all my paths."
18,33,12,"Behold, in this you are not just: I will answer you, for God is greater than man."
18,33,13,"Why do you strive against him? for he gives not account of any of his matters."
18,33,14,"For God speaks once, yea twice, yet man perceives it not."
18,33,15,"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;"
18,33,16,"Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,"
18,33,17,"That he may turn man from his purpose, and hide pride from man."
18,33,18,"He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword."
18,33,19,"He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:"
18,33,20,"So that his life abhors bread, and his soul the choicest food."
18,33,21,"His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen now stick out."
18,33,22,"Yea, his soul draws near unto the grave, and his life to those who bring death."
18,33,23,"If there be a messenger with him, a mediator, one of a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness:"
18,33,24,"Then he is gracious unto him, and says, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom."
18,33,25,"His flesh shall be younger than a childâ€™s: he shall return to the days of his youth:"
18,33,26,"He shall pray unto God, and he will be favorable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness."
18,33,27,"He looks upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;"
18,33,28,"He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light."
18,33,29,"Lo, all these things works God twice, three times, with man,"
18,33,30,"To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of life."
18,33,31,"Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold your peace, and I will speak."
18,33,32,"If you have any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify you."
18,33,33,"If not, hearken unto me: hold your peace, and I shall teach you wisdom."
18,34,1,"Furthermore Elihu answered and said,"
18,34,2,"Hear my words, O you wise men; and give ear unto me, you that have knowledge."
18,34,3,"For the ear tests words, as the mouth tastes food."
18,34,4,"Let us choose for us justice: let us know among ourselves what is good."
18,34,5,"For Job has said, I am righteous: and God has taken away my justice."
18,34,6,"Should I lie concerning my right? my wound is incurable though I am without transgression."
18,34,7,"What man is like Job, who drinks up scorn like water?"
18,34,8,"Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men."
18,34,9,"For he has said, It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God."
18,34,10,"Therefore hearken unto me, you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity."
18,34,11,"For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways."
18,34,12,"Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice."
18,34,13,"Who has given him charge over the earth? or who has laid on him the whole world?"
18,34,14,"If he should set his heart upon man, if he should gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;"
18,34,15,"All flesh would perish together, and man would turn again unto dust."
18,34,16,"If now you have understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words."
18,34,17,"Shall even he that hates right govern? and will you condemn him that is most just?"
18,34,18,"Is it fit to say to a king, You are wicked? and to princes, You are ungodly?"
18,34,19,"How much less to him that regards not the persons of princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands."
18,34,20,"In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without a hand."
18,34,21,"For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he sees all his steps."
18,34,22,"There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves."
18,34,23,"For he will not lay upon man more than what is right; that he should enter into judgment with God."
18,34,24,"He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their place."
18,34,25,"Therefore he knows their works, and he overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed."
18,34,26,"He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;"
18,34,27,"Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:"
18,34,28,"So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he hears the cry of the afflicted."
18,34,29,"When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:"
18,34,30,"That the hypocrite reigns not, lest the people be ensnared."
18,34,31,"Surely it is fitting to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:"
18,34,32,"That which I see not you teach me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more."
18,34,33,"Should it be according to your mind? he will recompense it, whether you refuse, or whether you choose; and not I: therefore declare what you know."
18,34,34,"Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me."
18,34,35,"Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom."
18,34,36,"My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because he answers like wicked men."
18,34,37,"For he adds rebellion unto his sin, he claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God."
18,35,1,"Elihu spoke moreover, and said,"
18,35,2,"Think you this to be right, that you said, My righteousness is more than Godâ€™s?"
18,35,3,"For you said, What advantage will it be unto you? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?"
18,35,4,"I will answer you, and your companions with you."
18,35,5,"Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than you."
18,35,6,"If you sin, what do you accomplish against him? or if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do unto him?"
18,35,7,"If you are righteous, what give you to him? or what receives he of your hand?"
18,35,8,"Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are; and your righteousness may profit the son of man."
18,35,9,"Because of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out because of the arm of the mighty."
18,35,10,"But none says, Where is God my maker, who gives songs in the night;"
18,35,11,"Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser than the fowls of heaven?"
18,35,12,"There they cry, but none gives answer, because of the pride of evil men."
18,35,13,"Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it."
18,35,14,"Although you say you shall not see him, yet justice is before him; therefore you must trust in him."
18,35,15,"But now, because it is not so, he has visited in his anger; yet he knows it not in a great extreme:"
18,35,16,"Therefore does Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplies words without knowledge."
18,36,1,"Elihu also proceeded, and said,"
18,36,2,"Bear with me a little, and I will show you that I have yet to speak on Godâ€™s behalf."
18,36,3,"I will get my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker."
18,36,4,"For truly my words shall not be false: he that is blameless in knowledge is with you."
18,36,5,"Behold, God is mighty, and despises no one: he is mighty in strength and wisdom."
18,36,6,"He preserves not the life of the wicked: but gives justice to the poor."
18,36,7,"He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings they are on the throne; yea, he does establish them forever, and they are exalted."
18,36,8,"And if they are bound in fetters, and are held in cords of affliction;"
18,36,9,"Then he shows them their work, and their transgressions, that they have exceeded."
18,36,10,"He opens also their ear to discipline, and commands that they return from iniquity."
18,36,11,"If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures."
18,36,12,"But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge."
18,36,13,"But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he binds them."
18,36,14,"They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean."
18,36,15,"He delivers the poor in his affliction, and opens their ears in oppression."
18,36,16,"Even so would he have removed you out of the distress into a broad place, where there is no restraint; and that which should be set on your table should be full of richness."
18,36,17,"But you have fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on you."
18,36,18,"Because there is wrath, beware lest he take you away with one blow: then a great ransom cannot deliver you."
18,36,19,"Will he esteem your riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength."
18,36,20,"Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place."
18,36,21,"Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this have you chosen rather than affliction."
18,36,22,"Behold, God exalts by his power: who teaches like him?"
18,36,23,"Who has prescribed him his way? or who can say, You have worked iniquity?"
18,36,24,"Remember that you magnify his work, which men behold."
18,36,25,"Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off."
18,36,26,"Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out."
18,36,27,"For he makes small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to its vapor:"
18,36,28,"Which the clouds do drop and pour upon man abundantly."
18,36,29,"Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the thunder of his tabernacle?"
18,36,30,"Behold, he spreads his lightning upon it, and covers the depths of the sea."
18,36,31,"For by them judges he the people; he gives food in abundance."
18,36,32,"With clouds he covers the light; and commands it not to shine by the cloud that comes between."
18,36,33,"The thunder thereof declares it, the cattle also, concerning the vapor."
18,37,1,"At this also my heart trembles, and is moved out of its place."
18,37,2,"Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goes out of his mouth."
18,37,3,"He directs it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth."
18,37,4,"After it a voice roars: he thunders with the voice of his excellency; and he will not restrain them when his voice is heard."
18,37,5,"God thunders marvelously with his voice; great things does he, which we cannot comprehend."
18,37,6,"For he says to the snow, Be on the earth; likewise to the gentle rain, and to the heavy rain of his strength."
18,37,7,"He seals up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work."
18,37,8,"Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places."
18,37,9,"Out of the south comes the whirlwind: and cold out of the north."
18,37,10,"By the breath of God ice is given: and the broad waters are frozen."
18,37,11,"Also with moisture he loads the thick cloud: he scatters his bright cloud:"
18,37,12,"And it is turned around by his guidance: that they may do whatsoever he commands them upon the face of the whole earth."
18,37,13,"He causes it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy."
18,37,14,"Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God."
18,37,15,"Do you know when God dispatched them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?"
18,37,16,"Do you know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is blameless in knowledge?"
18,37,17,"How your garments are warm, when he quiets the earth by the south wind?"
18,37,18,"Have you with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten mirror?"
18,37,19,"Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech because of darkness."
18,37,20,"Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speaks, surely he shall be swallowed up."
18,37,21,"And now men can not look on the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passes, and clears them."
18,37,22,"Fair weather comes out of the north: with God is awesome majesty."
18,37,23,"As for the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in abundant justice: he will not afflict."
18,37,24,"Men do therefore fear him: he respects not any that are wise of heart."
18,38,1,"Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,"

20,4,1,"Hear, you children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding."
20,4,2,"For I give you good doctrine, forsake not my law."
20,4,3,"For I was my father's son, tender and the only one in the sight of my mother."
20,4,4,"He taught me also, and said unto me, Let your heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live."

20,4,15,"Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away."
20,4,16,"For they sleep not, unless they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause someone to fall."
20,4,17,"For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence."
20,4,18,"But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more unto the perfect day."
20,4,19,"The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble."
20,4,20,"My son, attend to my words; incline your ear unto my sayings."
20,4,21,"Let them not depart from your eyes; keep them in the midst of your heart."
20,4,22,"For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh."

20,4,26,"Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established."
20,4,27,"Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove your foot from evil."
20,5,1,"My son, be attentive to my wisdom, and incline your ear to my understanding:"
20,5,2,"That you may preserve discretion, and that your lips may keep knowledge."
20,5,3,"For the lips of an immoral woman drop as a honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:"
20,5,4,"But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword."
20,5,5,"Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on sheol."
20,5,6,"Lest you should ponder the path of life, her ways are unstable, that you can not know them."
20,5,7,"Hear me now therefore, O you children, and depart not from the words of my mouth."
20,5,8,"Remove your way far from her, and come not near the door of her house:"
20,5,9,"Lest you give your honor unto others, and your years unto the merciless:"
20,5,10,"Lest strangers be filled with your wealth; and your labors go to the house of a foreigner;"
20,5,11,"And you mourn at the last, when your flesh and your body are consumed,"
20,5,12,"And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;"
20,5,13,"And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me!"
20,5,14,"I was almost in utter ruin in the midst of the congregation and assembly."
20,5,15,"Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well."
20,5,16,"Should your fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets?"
20,5,17,"Let them be only for your own, and not for strangers with you."
20,5,18,"Let your fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of your youth."
20,5,19,"Let her be as the loving deer and graceful doe; let her breasts satisfy you at all times; and be ravished always with her love."
20,5,20,"And why will you, my son, be infatuated with an immoral woman, and embrace the bosom of a seductress?"
20,5,21,"For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths."
20,5,22,"His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins."
20,5,23,"He shall die for lack of instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray."
20,6,1,"My son, if you become surety for your friend, if you have struck your hand with a stranger,"
20,6,2,"You are snared with the words of your mouth, you are taken with the words of your mouth."
20,6,3,"Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you have come into the hand of your friend; go, humble yourself, and plead with your friend."
20,6,4,"Give not sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids."
20,6,5,"Deliver yourself as a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler."
20,6,6,"Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:"
20,6,7,"Who having no guide, overseer, or ruler,"
20,6,8,"Provides her food in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest."
20,6,9,"How long will you sleep, O sluggard? when will you arise out of your sleep?"
20,6,10,"Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:"
20,6,11,"So shall your poverty come upon you like a vagabond, and your want like an armed man."
20,6,12,"A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth."
20,6,13,"He winks with his eyes, he signals with his feet, he motions with his fingers;"
20,6,14,"Perversity is in his heart, he devises evil continually; he sows discord."
20,6,15,"Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy."
20,6,16,"These six things does the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:"
20,6,17,"A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,"
20,6,18,"A heart that devises wicked imaginations, feet that are swift in running to evil,"
20,6,19,"A false witness that speaks lies, and he that sows discord among brethren."
20,6,20,"My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of your mother:"
20,6,21,"Bind them continually upon your heart, and tie them about your neck."
20,6,22,"When you go, it shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall keep you; and when you awake, it shall talk with you."
20,6,23,"For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:"
20,6,24,"To keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a seductress."
20,6,25,"Lust not after her beauty in your heart; neither let her allure you with her eyelids."
20,6,26,"For by means of a harlot a man is reduced to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will prey upon his precious life."
20,6,27,"Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?"
20,6,28,"Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?"
20,6,29,"So is he that goes in to his neighbor's wife; whosoever touches her shall not be innocent."
20,6,30,"Men do not despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;"
20,6,31,"But if he is found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give up all the goods of his house."
20,6,32,"But whosoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding: he that does it destroys his own soul."
20,6,33,"A wound and dishonor shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away."
20,6,34,"For jealousy causes the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance."
20,6,35,"He will not regard any ransom; neither will he be appeased, though you give many gifts."
20,7,1,"My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with you."
20,7,2,"Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of your eye."
20,7,3,"Bind them upon your fingers, write them upon the table of your heart."
20,7,4,"Say unto wisdom, you are my sister; and call understanding your kinswoman:"
20,7,5,"That they may keep you from the immoral woman, from the seductress who flatters with her words."
20,7,6,"For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,"

21,2,17,"Therefore I hated life; because the work that is done under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and like grasping the wind."
21,2,18,"Yea, I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun: because I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me."
21,2,19,"And who knows whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity."
21,2,20,"Therefore I gave my heart up to despair of all the labor in which I toiled under the sun."
21,2,21,"For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that has not labored in it shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil."
21,2,22,"For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart, with which he has labored under the sun?"
21,2,23,"For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart takes not rest in the night. This is also vanity."
21,2,24,"There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God."
21,2,25,"For who can eat, or who else can have enjoyment, more than I?"
21,2,26,"For God gives to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he gives the work of gathering and heaping up, only that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and grasping of the wind."
21,3,1,"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:"
21,3,2,"A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;"
21,3,3,"A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;"
21,3,4,"A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;"
21,3,5,"A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;"
21,3,6,"A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;"
21,3,7,"A time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;"
21,3,8,"A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace."
21,3,9,"What profit has he that works in that in which he labors?"
21,3,10,"I have seen the task, which God has given to the sons of men to be occupied in it."
21,3,11,"He has made every thing beautiful in its time: also he has put eternity in menâ€™s hearts, so that no man can find out the work that God does from the beginning to the end."
21,3,12,"I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life."
21,3,13,"And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor, it is the gift of God."
21,3,14,"I know that, whatsoever God does, it shall be forever: nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God does it, that men should fear before him."
21,3,15,"That which has been is now; and that which is to be has already been; and God requires that which is past."
21,3,16,"And moreover I saw under the sun the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there."
21,3,17,"I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time for every purpose and for every work."
21,3,18,"I said in my heart concerning the condition of the sons of men, that God might reveal them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts."
21,3,19,"For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; the same thing befalls them: as the one dies, so dies the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man has no advantage over a beast: for all is vanity."
21,3,20,"All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again."
21,3,21,"Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?"
21,3,22,"Therefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his lot: for who can bring him to see what shall be after him?"
21,4,1,"So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter."
21,4,2,"Therefore I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive."
21,4,3,"Yea, better is he than both, who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun."
21,4,4,"Again, I considered all toil, and every skillful work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbor. This is also vanity and grasping after the wind."
21,4,5,"The fool folds his hands together, and eats his own flesh."
21,4,6,"Better is a handful with quietness, than both hands full with toil and grasping for the wind."
21,4,7,"Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun."
21,4,8,"There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he has neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither says he, For whom do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a heavy travail."
21,4,9,"Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor."
21,4,10,"For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falls; for he has not another to help him up."
21,4,11,"Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?"
21,4,12,"And if one prevails against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken."
21,4,13,"Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no longer be admonished."
21,4,14,"For out of prison he comes to reign; yet he that is born in his kingdom might become poor."
21,4,15,"I considered all the living who walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his place."
21,4,16,"There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after him shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and grasping after the wind."
21,5,1,"Guard your steps when you go to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil."
21,5,2,"Be not rash with your mouth, and let not your heart be hasty to utter anything before God: for God is in heaven, and you upon earth: therefore let your words be few."
21,5,3,"For a dream comes through much business; and a fool's voice is known by a multitude of words."
21,5,4,"When you vow a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools: pay that which you have vowed."
21,5,5,"Better is it that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay."
21,5,6,"Permit not your mouth to cause your flesh to sin; neither say before the angel, that it was an error: why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?"
21,5,7,"For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also many vanities: but you fear God."
21,5,8,"If you see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of justice and righteousness in a province, marvel not at the matter: for the high official is watched by a higher one ; and there are yet higher ones over them."
21,5,9,"Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served from the field."
21,5,10,"He that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loves abundance, with increase: this is also vanity."
21,5,11,"When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: so what good is there to the owners, except the beholding of them with their eyes?"
21,5,12,"The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep."
21,5,13,"There is a great evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept by their owners to their hurt."
21,5,14,"But those riches are lost by a bad venture: when he begets a son, there is nothing in his hand."
21,5,15,"As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing from his labor, which he may carry away in his hand."
21,5,16,"And this also is a great evil, that just as he came, so shall he go: and what profit has he who has labored for the wind?"
21,5,17,"All his days also he eats in darkness, and he has much sorrow and wrath with his sickness."
21,5,18,"Behold that which I have seen: it is good and fitting for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor that he takes under the sun all the days of his life, which God gives him: for this is his lot."
21,5,19,"Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to accept his lot, and to rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God."
21,5,20,"For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God keeps him busy with the joy of his heart."
21,6,1,"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men:"
21,6,2,"A man to whom God has given riches, wealth, and honor, so that he wants nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God gives him not power to eat of it, but a stranger eats it: this is vanity, and it is an evil affliction."
21,6,3,"If a man begets a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, and his soul is not filled with good, and also that he has no burial; I say, that a stillborn birth is better than he."
21,6,4,"For he comes in with vanity, and departs in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness."
21,6,5,"Moreover he has not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this one has more rest than the other."
21,6,6,"Yea, though he lives a thousand years twice over, yet he has seen no good: do not all go to one place?"
21,6,7,"All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled."
21,6,8,"For what has the wise more than the fool? what has the poor, who knows to walk before the living?"
21,6,9,"Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and grasping after the wind."
21,6,10,"Whatever has been is named already, and it is known that this is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he."
21,6,11,"Since there are many things that increase vanity, how is man the better?"
21,6,12,"For who knows what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spends like a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?"
21,7,1,"A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth."
21,7,2,"It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart."
21,7,3,"Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better."
21,7,4,"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth."
21,7,5,"It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools."
21,7,6,"For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity."
21,7,7,"Surely oppression makes a wise man mad; and a bribe destroys the heart."
21,7,8,"Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit."
21,7,9,"Be not hasty in your spirit to be angry: for anger rests in the bosom of fools."
21,7,10,"Say you not, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for you do not inquire wisely concerning this."
21,7,11,"Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun."
21,7,12,"For wisdom is a defense, and money is a defense: but the excellence of knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to them that have it."
21,7,13,"Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?"
21,7,14,"In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also has set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing that will come after him."
21,7,15,"All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his life in his wickedness."
21,7,16,"Be not overly righteous; neither make yourself overly wise: why should you destroy yourself?"
21,7,17,"Be not overly wicked, neither be foolish: why should you die before your time?"
21,7,18,"It is good that you should take hold of this; yea, also from this withhold not your hand: for he that fears God shall come forth of them all."
21,7,19,"Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten mighty men who are in the city."
21,7,20,"For there is not a just man upon earth, that does good, and sins not."
21,7,21,"Also take not to heart all words that are spoken; lest you hear your servant curse you:"
21,7,22,"For oftentimes also your own heart knows that you yourself likewise have cursed others."
21,7,23,"All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me."
21,7,24,"That which is far off, and exceedingly deep, who can find it out?"
21,7,25,"I applied my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness:"
21,7,26,"And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands are fetters: whosoever pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her."
21,7,27,"Behold, this have I found, says the preacher, adding one thing to another, to find out the reason:"
21,7,28,"Which yet my soul seeks, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found."
21,7,29,"Lo, this only have I found, that God has made man upright; but they have sought out many devices."
21,8,1,"Who is as the wise man? and who knows the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom makes his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed."
21,8,2,"I counsel you to keep the king's commandment, and that for the sake of your oath to God."
21,8,3,"Be not hasty to go out of his presence: stand not for an evil thing; for he does whatsoever pleases him."
21,8,4,"Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What are you doing?"
21,8,5,"Whosoever keeps the commandment shall experience no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerns both time and judgment."
21,8,6,"Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is heavy upon him."
21,8,7,"For he knows not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?"
21,8,8,"There is no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither has he power in the day of death: and there is no release from that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it."
21,8,9,"All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt."
21,8,10,"And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the holy place, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity."
21,8,11,"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil."
21,8,12,"Though a sinner does evil a hundred times, and his days are prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, who fear before him:"
21,8,13,"But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he fears not before God."
21,8,14,"There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there are just men, unto whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men, to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity."
21,8,15,"Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him in his labor all the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun."
21,8,16,"When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is one who neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes:)"
21,8,17,"Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labors to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover; though a wise man thinks to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it."
21,9,1,"For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knows either love or hatred by all that is before them."
21,9,2,"All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrifices, and to him that sacrifices not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that swears, as he that fears an oath."
21,9,3,"This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead."
21,9,4,"For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion."
21,9,5,"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten."
21,9,6,"Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in any thing that is done under the sun."
21,9,7,"Go your way, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God now accepts your works."
21,9,8,"Let your garments be always white; and let your head lack no ointment."
21,9,9,"Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of the life of your vanity, which he has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity: for that is your portion in this life, and in your labor which you perform under the sun."
21,9,10,"Whatsoever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, where you go."
21,9,11,"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happens to them all."
21,9,12,"For man also knows not his time: as the fish that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them."
21,9,13,"This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:"
21,9,14,"There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:"
21,9,15,"Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man."
21,9,16,"Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard."
21,9,17,"The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that rules among fools."
21,9,18,"Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroys much good."
21,10,1,"Dead flies cause the ointment of the perfumer to send forth a foul odor: so does a little folly to him that is respected for wisdom and honor."
21,10,2,"A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left."
21,10,3,"Yea also, when he that is a fool walks by the way, his wisdom fails him, and he says to every one that he is a fool."
21,10,4,"If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, leave not your post; for yielding pacifies great offences."
21,10,5,"There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceeds from the ruler:"
21,10,6,"Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place."
21,10,7,"I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth."
21,10,8,"He that digs a pit shall fall into it; and whosoever breaks through a wall, a serpent shall bite him."
21,10,9,"Whosoever quarries stones may be hurt by them; and he that splits wood shall be endangered by it."
21,10,10,"If the iron is blunt, and he does not sharpen the edge, then must he use more strength: but wisdom helps one to succeed."
21,10,11,"Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better."
21,10,12,"The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow him up."
21,10,13,"The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is wicked madness."
21,10,14,"A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?"
21,10,15,"The labor of the foolish wearies every one of them, because he knows not how to go to the city."
21,10,16,"Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes feast in the morning!"
21,10,17,"Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes feast at the proper time, for strength, and not for drunkenness!"
21,10,18,"By much slothfulness the building decays; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks."
21,10,19,"A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes merry: but money answers all things."
21,10,20,"Curse not the king, no not even in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter."
21,11,1,"Cast your bread upon the waters: for you shall find it after many days."
21,11,2,"Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for you know not what evil shall be upon the earth."
21,11,3,"If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree falls toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it shall be."
21,11,4,"He that observes the wind shall not sow; and he that regards the clouds shall not reap."
21,11,5,"As you know not what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so you know not the works of God who makes all."
21,11,6,"In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not your hand: for you know not which shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both alike shall be good."
21,11,7,"Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun:"
21,11,8,"But if a man lives many years, and rejoices in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that comes is vanity."
21,11,9,"Rejoice, O young man, in your youth; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes: but know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment."
21,11,10,"Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity."
21,12,1,"Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw near, when you shall say, I have no pleasure in them;"
21,12,2,"While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:"
21,12,3,"In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows grow dim,"
21,12,4,"And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;"
21,12,5,"Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and terrors are in the way, and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goes to his eternal home, and the mourners go about the streets:"
21,12,6,"Before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern."
21,12,7,"Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it."
21,12,8,"Vanity of vanities, says the preacher; all is vanity."
21,12,9,"And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he pondered, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs."
21,12,10,"The preacher sought to find acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth."
21,12,11,"The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails firmly fixed by the masters of assemblies, which are given by one shepherd."
21,12,12,"And further, my son, be admonished by these: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh."
21,12,13,"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man."
21,12,14,"For God shall bring every work into judgment, including every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil."
22,1,1,"The song of songs, which is Solomon's."
22,1,2,"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for your love is better than wine."
22,1,3,"Because of the fragrance of your good ointments your name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love you."
22,1,4,"Draw me, we will run after you: the king has brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in you, we will remember your love more than wine: the upright love you."
22,1,5,"I am dark, but lovely, O you daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon."
22,1,6,"Look not upon me, because I am dark, because the sun has darkened me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but my own vineyard have I not kept."
22,1,7,"Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, where you feed, where you make your flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turns aside by the flocks of your companions?"
22,1,8,"If you know not, O you fairest among women, go your way forth in the footsteps of the flock, and feed your kids beside the shepherds' tents."
22,1,9,"I have compared you, O my love, to a mare of Pharaoh's chariots."
22,1,10,"Your cheeks are lovely with rows of jewels, your neck with chains of gold."
22,1,11,"We will make you ornaments of gold with studs of silver."
22,1,12,"While the king sits at his table, my perfume sends forth its fragrance."
22,1,13,"A bundle of myrrh is my beloved unto me; he shall lie all night between my breasts."
22,1,14,"My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of Engedi."
22,1,15,"Behold, you are fair, my love; behold, you are fair; you have doves' eyes."
22,1,16,"Behold, you are handsome, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green."
22,1,17,"The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir."

24,41,9,"Now the pit in which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was that which Asa the king had made for defense against Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain."
24,41,10,"Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of the people that were in Mizpah, even the kingâ€™s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites."
24,41,11,"But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,"

24,52,26,"So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah."
24,52,27,"And the king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of its own land."
24,52,28,"These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:"
24,52,29,"In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:"
24,52,30,"In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred."
24,52,31,"And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,"
24,52,32,"And spoke kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,"
24,52,33,"And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life."
24,52,34,"And for his provision, there was a regular ration given him from the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life."
25,1,1,"How does the city sit lovely, that was full of people! how has she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how has she become a slave!"
25,1,2,"She weeps bitterly in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she has none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they have become her enemies."
25,1,3,"Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwells among the nations, she finds no rest: all her persecutors overtook her in her distress."
25,1,4,"The roads to Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness."
25,1,5,"Her adversaries have become the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children have gone into captivity before the enemy."
25,1,6,"And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty has departed: her princes have become like harts that find no pasture, and they have gone without strength before the pursuer."
25,1,7,"Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths."
25,1,8,"Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sighs, and turns away."
25,1,9,"Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembers not her latter end; therefore she came down awesomely: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy has magnified himself."
25,1,10,"The adversary has spread out his hand over all her precious things: for she has seen that the nations entered into her sanctuary, whom you did command that they should not enter into your congregation."
25,1,11,"All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their treasures for food to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I have become despised."
25,1,12,"Is it nothing to you, all you that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, which the LORD has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger."
25,1,13,"From above has he sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them: he has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: he has made me desolate and faint all the day."
25,1,14,"The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are woven together, and come up upon my neck: he has made my strength to fall, the Lord has delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up."
25,1,15,"The Lord has trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he has called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord has trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress."
25,1,16,"For these things I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed."
25,1,17,"Zion spreads forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the LORD has commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as an unclean thing among them."
25,1,18,"The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men have gone into captivity."
25,1,19,"I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and my elders died in the city, while they sought their food to relieve their souls."
25,1,20,"Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my soul is troubled; my heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaves, at home there is as death."
25,1,21,"They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it: you will bring the day that you have announced, and they shall be like unto me."
25,1,22,"Let all their wickedness come before you; and do unto them, as you have done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint."
25,2,1,"How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!"
25,2,2,"The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and has not pitied: he has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; he has brought them down to the ground: he has polluted the kingdom and its princes."
25,2,3,"He has cut off in his fierce anger all the might of Israel: he has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devours round about."
25,2,4,"He has bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and has slain all that were pleasant to the eye in the tent of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire."
25,2,5,"The Lord was as an enemy: he has swallowed up Israel, he has swallowed up all her palaces: he has destroyed his strongholds, and has increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation."
25,2,6,"And he has violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were a garden: he has destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD has caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and has despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest."
25,2,7,"The Lord has cast off his altar, he has abhorred his sanctuary, he has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast."
25,2,8,"The LORD has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he has stretched out a line, he has not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together."
25,2,9,"Her gates are sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD."
25,2,10,"The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground."
25,2,11,"My eyes do fail with tears, my soul is troubled, my heart is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the infants faint in the streets of the city."
25,2,12,"They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine? when they faint as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom."
25,2,13,"What thing shall I take to witness for you? what thing shall I liken to you, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? for your run is vast as the sea: who can heal you?"
25,2,14,"Your prophets have seen vain and foolish things for you: and they have not uncovered your iniquity, to turn away your captivity; but have given you false oracles and causes of banishment."
25,2,15,"All that pass by clap their hands at you; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?"
25,2,16,"All your enemies have opened their mouth against you: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it."
25,2,17,"The LORD has done that which he had purposed; he has fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he has thrown down, and has not pitied: and he has caused your enemy to rejoice over you, he has set up the might of your adversaries."
25,2,18,"Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give yourself no relief; let not your eyes rest."
25,2,19,"Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street."
25,2,20,"Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom you have done this. Shall the women eat their offspring, the children of their tender care? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?"
25,2,21,"The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword; you have slain them in the day of your anger; you have killed, and not pitied."
25,2,22,"You have called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have cared for and brought up has my enemy consumed."
25,3,1,"I am the man that has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath."
25,3,2,"He has led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light."
25,3,3,"Surely against me has he turned; he turns his hand against me all the day."
25,3,4,"My flesh and my skin has he made old: he has broken my bones."
25,3,5,"He has besieged me, and surrounded me with gall and travail."
25,3,6,"He has set me in dark places, like they that are long dead."
25,3,7,"He has hedged me in, that I cannot get out: he has made my chain heavy."
25,3,8,"Also when I cry and shout, he shuts out my prayer."
25,3,9,"He has enclosed my ways with hewn stone, he has made my paths crooked."
25,3,10,"He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places."
25,3,11,"He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he has made me desolate."
25,3,12,"He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow."
25,3,13,"He has caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my heart."
25,3,14,"I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day."
25,3,15,"He has filled me with bitterness, he has made me drunk with wormwood."
25,3,16,"He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he has covered me with ashes."
25,3,17,"And you have removed my soul far off from peace: I forgot prosperity."
25,3,18,"And I said, My strength and my hope has perished from the LORD:"
25,3,19,"Remembering my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall."
25,3,20,"My soul has them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me."
25,3,21,"This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope."
25,3,22,"It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not."
25,3,23,"They are new every morning: great is your faithfulness."
25,3,24,"The LORD is my portion, says my soul; therefore will I hope in him."
25,3,25,"The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeks him."
25,3,26,"It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD."
25,3,27,"It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth."
25,3,28,"He sits alone and keeps silence, because he has borne it upon him."
25,3,29,"He puts his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope."
25,3,30,"He gives his cheek to him that strikes him: he is filled full with reproach."
25,3,31,"For the Lord will not cast off forever:"
25,3,32,"But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies."
25,3,33,"For he does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men."
25,3,34,"To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,"
25,3,35,"To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,"
25,3,36,"To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approves not."
25,3,37,"Who is he that says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord commands it not?"
25,3,38,"Out of the mouth of the most High proceeds not evil and good?"
25,3,39,"Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?"
25,3,40,"Let us search and examine our ways, and turn again to the LORD."
25,3,41,"Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens."
25,3,42,"We have transgressed and have rebelled: you have not pardoned."
25,3,43,"You have covered with anger, and persecuted us: you have slain, you have not pitied."
25,3,44,"You have covered yourself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through."
25,3,45,"You have made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people."
25,3,46,"All our enemies have opened their mouths against us."
25,3,47,"Fear and a snare has come upon us, desolation and destruction."
25,3,48,"My eye runs down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people."
25,3,49,"My eye flows down, and ceases not, without any intermission,"
25,3,50,"Till the LORD looks down, and beholds from heaven."
25,3,51,"My eye affects my heart because of all the daughters of my city."
25,3,52,"My enemies chased me hard, like a bird, without cause."
25,3,53,"They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me."
25,3,54,"Waters flowed over my head; then I said, I am cut off."
25,3,55,"I called upon your name, O LORD, out of the lowest dungeon."
25,3,56,"You have heard my voice: hide not your ear at my breathing, at my cry."
25,3,57,"You drew near in the day that I called upon you: you said,"
25,3,58,"O Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed my life."
25,3,59,"O LORD, you have seen my wrong: judge you my cause."
25,3,60,"You have seen all their vengeance and all their plots against me."
25,3,61,"You have heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their plots against me;"
25,3,62,"The lips of those that rose up against me, and their whispering against me all the day."
25,3,63,"Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their music."
25,3,64,"Render unto them a recompense, O LORD, according to the work of their hands."
25,3,65,"Give them sorrow of heart, your curse unto them."
25,3,66,"Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD."
25,4,1,"How has the gold become dim! how has the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street."
25,4,2,"The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!"
25,4,3,"Even the jackals draw out the breast, they nurse their young ones: the daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness."
25,4,4,"The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaks it unto them."
25,4,5,"They that did eat delicacies are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace ash heaps."
25,4,6,"For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, with no hands laid on her."
25,4,7,"Her princes were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their appearance was of sapphire:"
25,4,8,"Their appearance is now blacker than coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaves to their bones; it is withered, it has become like a dry stick."
25,4,9,"They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for lack of the fruits of the field."
25,4,10,"The hands of the compassionate women have boiled their own children: they were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people."
25,4,11,"The LORD has accomplished his fury; he has poured out his fierce anger, and has kindled a fire in Zion, and it has devoured its foundations."
25,4,12,"The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem."
25,4,13,"For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,"
25,4,14,"They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments."
25,4,15,"They cried unto them, Depart; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn there."
25,4,16,"The anger of the LORD has scattered them; he will no longer regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders."
25,4,17,"As for us, our eyes as yet failed, watching for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us."
25,4,18,"They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end has come."
25,4,19,"Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness."
25,4,20,"The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations."
25,4,21,"Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwells in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto you: you shall be drunk, and shall make yourself naked."
25,4,22,"The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry you away into captivity: he will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover your sins."
25,5,1,"Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach."
25,5,2,"Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens."
25,5,3,"We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows."
25,5,4,"We have drunk our water at a price; our wood is sold unto us."
25,5,5,"Our necks are under persecution: we labor, and have no rest."
25,5,6,"We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread."
25,5,7,"Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities."
25,5,8,"Servants have ruled over us: there is none that does deliver us out of their hand."
25,5,9,"We got our bread at the peril of our lives because of the sword in the wilderness."
25,5,10,"Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine."
25,5,11,"They ravished the women in Zion, and the maidens in the cities of Judah."
25,5,12,"Princes were hung up by their hands: the faces of elders were not honored."
25,5,13,"They took the young men to grind, and the children stagger under loads of wood."
25,5,14,"The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music."
25,5,15,"The joy of our heart has ceased; our dance has turned into mourning."
25,5,16,"The crown has fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!"
25,5,17,"For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim."
25,5,18,"Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it."
25,5,19,"You, O LORD, remain forever; your throne from generation to generation."
25,5,20,"Why do you forget us forever, and forsake us for so long a time?"
25,5,21,"Turn us back to you, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old."
25,5,22,"But you have utterly rejected us; you are very angry against us."
26,1,1,"Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God."
26,1,2,"On the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachinâ€™s captivity,"
26,1,3,"The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him."
26,1,4,"And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire engulfing itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of its midst as the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire."
26,1,5,"Also out of its midst came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man."
26,1,6,"And each one had four faces, and each one had four wings."
26,1,7,"And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calfâ€™s foot: and they sparkled like the color of burnished bronze."
26,1,8,"And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and the four had their faces and their wings."
26,1,9,"Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went each one straight forward."
26,1,10,"As for the likeness of their faces, the four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and the four had the face of an ox on the left side; the four also had the face of an eagle."
26,1,11,"Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of each one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies."
26,1,12,"And they went each one straight forward: wherever the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went."
26,1,13,"As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: they went back and forth among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning."
26,1,14,"And the living creatures ran back and forth like the appearance of a flash of lightning."
26,1,15,"Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, a wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, with its four faces."
26,1,16,"The appearance of the wheels and their workings was like the color of beryl: and the four had the same likeness: and their appearance and their workings was, as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel."
26,1,17,"When they went, they went in any of four directions: and they turned not when they went."
26,1,18,"As for their rims, they were so high that they were awesome; and their rims were full of eyes, round about the four of them."
26,1,19,"And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up."
26,1,20,"Wherever the spirit was to go, they went, there was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up with them: for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
26,1,21,"When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up along with them: for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."
26,1,22,"And the likeness of the firmament above the heads of the living creature was as the color of awesome crystal, stretched forth over their heads above."
26,1,23,"And under the firmament were their wings spread out straight, the one toward the other: each one had two, which covered on this side, and each one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies."
26,1,24,"And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of tumult, as the noise of an army: when they stood, they let down their wings."
26,1,25,"And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings."
26,1,26,"And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it."
26,1,27,"And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his waist even upward, and from the appearance of his waist even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about."
26,1,28,"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke."
26,2,1,"And he said unto me,"
26,2,2,"And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spoke unto me."
26,2,3,"And he said unto me,"

26,3,1,"Moreover he said unto me,"
26,3,2,"So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that scroll."

26,3,13,"I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, and a noise of a loud rumbling."
26,3,14,"So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me."
26,3,15,"Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days."

26,40,31,"And its arches were toward the outer court; and palm trees were upon its posts: and the ascent to it had eight steps."
26,40,32,"And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these same measurements."
26,40,33,"And its little chambers, and its posts, and its arches, were according to these same measurements: and there were windows in it and in its arches round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits wide."
26,40,34,"And its arches were toward the outer court; and palm trees were upon its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps."
26,40,35,"And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these same measurements;"
26,40,36,"Its little chambers, its posts, and its arches, and the windows in it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the width five and twenty cubits."
26,40,37,"And its posts were toward the outer court; and palm trees were upon its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps."
26,40,38,"And the chambers and its entrance were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering."
26,40,39,"And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay on them the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering."
26,40,40,"And on the outside, as one goes up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables."
26,40,41,"Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, on which they slew their sacrifices."
26,40,42,"And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high: on which also they laid the instruments with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice."
26,40,43,"And inside were hooks, a hand wide, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering."
26,40,44,"And outside the inner gate were the chambers for the singers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate; facing toward the south: one at the side of the east gate facing toward the north."
26,40,45,"And he said unto me, This chamber, facing toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers in charge of the house."
26,40,46,"And the chamber facing toward the north is for the priests, the keepers in charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, who come near to the LORD to minister unto him."
26,40,47,"So he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits wide, foursquare; and the altar that was in front of the house."
26,40,48,"And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the width of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side."
26,40,49,"The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and he brought me by the steps by which they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side."
26,41,1,"Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits wide on the one side, and six cubits wide on the other side, which was the width of the tabernacle."
26,41,2,"And the width of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured its length, forty cubits: and the width, twenty cubits."
26,41,3,"Then went he inside, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the width of the door, seven cubits."
26,41,4,"So he measured its length, twenty cubits; and its width, twenty cubits, beyond the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place."
26,41,5,"After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the width of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side."
26,41,6,"And the side chambers were three stories, one over another, and thirty in each story; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have support, but they were not supported by the wall of the house."
26,41,7,"And the side chambers became wider as they ascended from story to story, corresponding to the enlargement of the offset from story to story round about the house; on the side of the house a stairway led upward, and thus one went up from the lowest story to the top story through the middle story."
26,41,8,"I saw also an elevation of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full rod of six great cubits."
26,41,9,"The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were inside."
26,41,10,"And between the chambers was a width of twenty cubits round about the house on every side."
26,41,11,"And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the width of the place that was left was five cubits round about."
26,41,12,"Now the building that was facing the separate courtyard at the end toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and its length ninety cubits."
26,41,13,"So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate courtyard, and the building, with its walls, a hundred cubits long;"
26,41,14,"Also the width of the face of the house, and of the separate courtyard toward the east, a hundred cubits."
26,41,15,"And he measured the length of the building opposite the separate courtyard which was behind it, and its galleries on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;"
26,41,16,"The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, opposite the door, paneled with wood round about, from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;"
26,41,17,"To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and outside, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure."
26,41,18,"And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;"
26,41,19,"So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about."
26,41,20,"From the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple."
26,41,21,"The posts of the temple were square, and also the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one like the appearance of the other."
26,41,22,"The altar of wood was three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, and its length, and its walls, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD."
26,41,23,"And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors."
26,41,24,"And the doors had two leaves apiece, two swinging leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door."
26,41,25,"And there were carved on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, as were carved upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch outside."
26,41,26,"And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks."
26,42,1,"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was opposite the separate courtyard, and which was opposite the building facing north."
26,42,2,"Facing the length, which was a hundred cubits, was the north door, and the width was fifty cubits."
26,42,3,"Opposite the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and facing the pavement which was for the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories."
26,42,4,"And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits width toward the inside, at a distance of one cubit; and their doors faced north."
26,42,5,"Now the upper chambers were narrower: for the galleries took more space away from these, than from the lower, and the middle chambers of the building."
26,42,6,"For they were in three stories, but had not pillars like the pillars of the courts: therefore the upper chambers were narrowed, more than the lower and the middle chambers from the ground."
26,42,7,"And the wall that was outside, opposite the chambers, toward the outer court at the front of the chambers, its length was fifty cubits."
26,42,8,"For the length of the chambers that were on the outer court was fifty cubits: while those facing the temple were a hundred cubits."
26,42,9,"And below these chambers was an entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court."
26,42,10,"There were chambers in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separate courtyard, and opposite the building."
26,42,11,"And the walk was before them, and they were like the appearance of the chambers which were facing the north, as long as they, and as wide as they: and all their exits were according to their plans, as were their doors."
26,42,12,"And like the doors of the chambers that were facing the south there was a door in front of the walk, even the walk directly in front of the wall facing the east, as one enters them."
26,42,13,"Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are opposite the separate courtyard, they are holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the grain offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy."
26,42,14,"When the priests enter them, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments in which they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people."
26,42,15,"Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out through the gate which faces toward the east, and measured it round about."
26,42,16,"He measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods, with the measuring rod all around."
26,42,17,"He measured the north side, five hundred rods, with the measuring rod all around."
26,42,18,"He measured the south side, five hundred rods, with the measuring rod."
26,42,19,"He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred rods with the measuring rod."
26,42,20,"He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall all around, five hundred rods long, and five hundred wide, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the common place."
26,43,1,"Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east:"
26,43,2,"And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory."
26,43,3,"And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face."
26,43,4,"And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate which faces toward the east."
26,43,5,"So the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house."
26,43,6,"And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me."

26,46,19,"After that he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which faced toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward."
26,46,20,"Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the grain offering; that they bear them not out into the outer court, to sanctify the people."
26,46,21,"Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court."
26,46,22,"In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty wide: these four corners were of the same measure."
26,46,23,"And there was a row of building stones all around in them, all around the four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows of stones all around."
26,46,24,"Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people."
26,47,1,"Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the front of the house faced toward the east, and the waters came down from under the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar."
26,47,2,"Then he brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around the way outside to the outer gate by the way that faces eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side."
26,47,3,"And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were up to the ankles."
26,47,4,"Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the waist."
26,47,5,"Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over."
26,47,6,"And he said unto me, Son of man, have you seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river."
26,47,7,"Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other."
26,47,8,"Then he said unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters of the sea shall be healed."
26,47,9,"And it shall come to pass, that everything that lives, which moves, wherever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come there: for they shall be healed; and everything shall live where the river comes."
26,47,10,"And it shall come to pass, that the fishermen shall stand upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; there shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be the same kinds as the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many."
26,47,11,"But its swamps and its marshes shall not be healed; they shall be given over to salt."
26,47,12,"And by the river upon its bank, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for food, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall its fruit be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to its months, because the waters flowed out of the sanctuary: and its fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for medicine."

27,1,1,"In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it."
27,1,2,"And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god."
27,1,3,"And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's descendants, and of the princes;"
27,1,4,"Young men in whom was no blemish, but handsome, and skilful in all wisdom, and gifted in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the language of the Chaldeans."
27,1,5,"And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's food, and of the wine which he drank: so training them three years, that at the end of that time they might stand before the king."
27,1,6,"Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:"
27,1,7,"Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego."
27,1,8,"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's food, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself."
27,1,9,"Now God had brought Daniel into favor and kindness with the prince of the eunuchs."
27,1,10,"And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse looking than the young men who are of your age? then shall you make me endanger my head to the king."
27,1,11,"Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,"
27,1,12,"Test your servants, I beseech you, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink."
27,1,13,"Then let our countenances be looked upon before you, and the countenance of the young men that eat of the portion of the king's food: and as you see fit, deal with your servants."
27,1,14,"So he consented to them in this matter, and tested them ten days."
27,1,15,"And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who did eat the portion of the king's food."
27,1,16,"Thus Melzar took away the portion of their food, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them vegetables."
27,1,17,"As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams."
27,1,18,"Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar."
27,1,19,"And the king spoke with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king."
27,1,20,"And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm."
27,1,21,"And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus."
27,2,1,"And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, by which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep went from him."
27,2,2,"Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king."
27,2,3,"And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream."
27,2,4,"Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Aramaic, O king, live forever: tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation."
27,2,5,"The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if you will not make known unto me the dream, with its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap."
27,2,6,"But if you show the dream, and its interpretation, you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream, and its interpretation."
27,2,7,"They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it."
27,2,8,"The king answered and said, I know of certainty that you would gain the time, because you see the thing is gone from me."
27,2,9,"But if you will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation."
27,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can tell the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean."
27,2,11,"And it is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is none other that can reveal it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."
27,2,12,"For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon."
27,2,13,"And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain."
27,2,14,"Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:"
27,2,15,"He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel."
27,2,16,"Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation."
27,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:"
27,2,18,"That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon."
27,2,19,"Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven."
27,2,20,"Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:"
27,2,21,"And he changes the times and the seasons: he removes kings, and sets up kings: he gives wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:"
27,2,22,"He reveals the deep and secret things: he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him."
27,2,23,"I thank you, and praise you, O God of my fathers, who has given me wisdom and might, and has made known unto me now what we desired of you: for you have now made known unto us the king's matter."
27,2,24,"Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation."
27,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation."
27,2,26,"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, are you able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?"
27,2,27,"Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers, cannot show unto the king;"
27,2,28,"But there is a God in heaven that reveals secrets, and makes known to king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed, are these;"
27,2,29,"As for you, O king, your thoughts came into your mind upon your bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that reveals secrets makes known to you what shall come to pass."
27,2,30,"But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than anyone living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that you might know the thoughts of your heart."
27,2,31,"You, O king, saw, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and its form was frightening."
27,2,32,"This image's head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,"
27,2,33,"Its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay."
27,2,34,"You saw till a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces."
27,2,35,"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
27,2,36,"This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king."
27,2,37,"You, O king, are a king of kings: for the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory."
27,2,38,"And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven has he given into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all. You are this head of gold."
27,2,39,"And after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you, and another third kingdom of bronze, which shall bear rule over all the earth."
27,2,40,"And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: since iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things: and as iron that breaks all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise."
27,2,41,"And as you saw the feet and toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it the strength of the iron, just as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay."
27,2,42,"And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken."
27,2,43,"And as you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the descendants of men: but they shall not hold one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay."
27,2,44,"And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever."
27,2,45,"Just as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and its interpretation sure."
27,2,46,"Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and incense unto him."
27,2,47,"The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is God of gods, and Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you could reveal this secret."
27,2,48,"Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon."
27,2,49,"Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king."
27,3,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and its width six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon."
27,3,2,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the administrators, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
27,3,3,"Then the satraps, the administrators, and governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up."
27,3,4,"Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,"
27,3,5,"That at what time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up:"
27,3,6,"And whosoever falls not down and worships shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace."
27,3,7,"Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up."
27,3,8,"Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews."
27,3,9,"They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever."
27,3,10,"You, O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image:"
27,3,11,"And whosoever falls not down and worships, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace."
27,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded you: they serve not your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up."
27,3,13,"Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king."
27,3,14,"Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do you not serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?"
27,3,15,"Now if you are ready that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if you worship not, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?"
27,3,16,"Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter."
27,3,17,"If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king."
27,3,18,"But if not, be it known unto you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up."
27,3,19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his appearance was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated."
27,3,20,"And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace."
27,3,21,"Then these men were bound in their coats, their trousers, and their turbans, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
27,3,22,"Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego."
27,3,23,"And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace."
27,3,24,"Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said unto his counselors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king."
27,3,25,"He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are not hurt; and the form of the fourth is like a son of the gods."
27,3,26,"Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spoke, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the most high God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth out of the midst of the fire."
27,3,27,"And the satraps, administrators, and governors, and the king's counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats affected, nor had the smell of fire come upon them."
27,3,28,"Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."
27,3,29,"Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, who speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made an ash heap: because there is no other God that can deliver in this way."
27,3,30,"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon."
27,4,1,"Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you."
27,4,2,"I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the most high God has worked for me."
27,4,3,"How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation."
27,4,4,"I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:"
27,4,5,"I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me."
27,4,6,"Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream."
27,4,7,"Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me its interpretation."
27,4,8,"But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,"
27,4,9,"O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation."
27,4,10,"Thus were the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great."
27,4,11,"The tree grew, and was strong, and its height reached unto heaven, and its sight to the end of all the earth:"
27,4,12,"Its leaves were fair, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in its boughs, and all flesh was fed from it."
27,4,13,"I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher, a holy one came down from heaven;"
27,4,14,"He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches:"
27,4,15,"Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:"
27,4,16,"Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him: and let seven times pass over him."
27,4,17,"This sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the decision by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will, and sets up over it the lowliest of men."
27,4,18,"This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but you are able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in you."
27,4,19,"Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or its interpretation, trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, may the dream be for them that hate you, and its interpretation for your enemies."
27,4,20,"The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and its sight to all the earth;"
27,4,21,"Whose leaves were fair, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:"
27,4,22,"It is you, O king, that have grown and become strong: for your greatness has grown, and reached unto heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth."
27,4,23,"And since the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;"
27,4,24,"This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which has come upon my lord the king:"
27,4,25,"That they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make you eat grass like oxen, and they shall wet you with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will."
27,4,26,"And since they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; your kingdom shall be sure unto you, after you shall have known that the heavens do rule."
27,4,27,"Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto you, and break off your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of your tranquility."
27,4,28,"All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar."
27,4,29,"At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon."
27,4,30,"The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?"
27,4,31,"While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying,"
27,4,32,""
27,4,33,"The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hair had grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws."
27,4,34,"And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes unto heaven, and my understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honored him that lives forever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:"
27,4,35,"And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can restrain his hand, or say unto him, What do you?"
27,4,36,"At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned unto me; and my counselors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me."
27,4,37,"Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase."
27,5,1,"Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand."
27,5,2,"Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his lords, his wives, and his concubines, might drink from them."
27,5,3,"Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his lords, his wives, and his concubines, drank from them."
27,5,4,"They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone."
27,5,5,"In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote opposite the lampstand upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote."
27,5,6,"Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his hips were loosened, and his knees struck one against another."
27,5,7,"The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spoke, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and show me its interpretation, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."
27,5,8,"Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king its interpretation."
27,5,9,"Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonished."
27,5,10,"Now the queen because of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the queen spoke and said, O king, live forever: let not your thoughts trouble you, nor let your countenance be changed:"
27,5,11,"There is a man in your kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar your father, the king, I say, your father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;"
27,5,12,"Because an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and solving of riddles, and explaining of problems, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation."
27,5,13,"Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spoke and said unto Daniel, Are you that Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?"
27,5,14,"I have even heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you."
27,5,15,"And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me its interpretation: but they could not show the interpretation of the thing:"
27,5,16,"And I have heard of you, that you can make interpretations, and explain doubts: now if you can read the writing, and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom."
27,5,17,"Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let your gifts be to yourself, and give your rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation."
27,5,18,"O king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honor:"
27,5,19,"And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down."
27,5,20,"But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:"
27,5,21,"And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appoints over it whomever he will."
27,5,22,"And you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this;"
27,5,23,"But have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you, and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine in them; and you have praised the gods of silver, and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, have you not glorified:"
27,5,24,"Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written."
27,5,25,"And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN."
27,5,26,"This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE; God has numbered your kingdom, and finished it."
27,5,27,"TEKEL; you are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting."
27,5,28,"PERES; Your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians."
27,5,29,"Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom."
27,5,30,"In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain."
27,5,31,"And Darius the Mede took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old."
27,6,1,"It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be over the whole kingdom;"
27,6,2,"And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the satraps might give accounts unto them, and the king should suffer no loss."
27,6,3,"Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm."
27,6,4,"Then the presidents and satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault; because he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him."
27,6,5,"Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God."
27,6,6,"Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live forever."
27,6,7,"All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the satraps, the counselors, and the advisors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, except from you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions."
27,6,8,"Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which alters not."
27,6,9,"Therefore king Darius signed the written decree."
27,6,10,"Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before."
27,6,11,"Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God."
27,6,12,"Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king's decree; have you not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days, except of you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which alters not."
27,6,13,"Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regards not you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day."
27,6,14,"Then the king, when he heard these words, was greatly displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him."
27,6,15,"Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed."
27,6,16,"Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said unto Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you."
27,6,17,"And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel."
27,6,18,"Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him."
27,6,19,"Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions."
27,6,20,"And when he came to the den, he cried with a grieved voice unto Daniel: and the king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?"
27,6,21,"Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live forever."
27,6,22,"My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: because before him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, have I done no wrong."
27,6,23,"Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of harm was found upon him, because he believed in his God."
27,6,24,"And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions overpowered them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they ever came at the bottom of the den."
27,6,25,"Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you."
27,6,26,"I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and steadfast forever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end."
27,6,27,"He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions."
27,6,28,"So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian."
27,7,1,"In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters."
27,7,2,"Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea."
27,7,3,"And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another."
27,7,4,"The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it."
27,7,5,"And behold another beast, a second, like a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh."
27,7,6,"After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it."
27,7,7,"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns."
27,7,8,"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things."
27,7,9,"I beheld till the thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and its wheels as burning fire."
27,7,10,"A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."
27,7,11,"I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame."
27,7,12,"As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time."
27,7,13,"I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him."
27,7,14,"And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed."
27,7,15,"I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me."
27,7,16,"I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things."
27,7,17,"These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth."
27,7,18,"But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever."
27,7,19,"Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of bronze; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;"
27,7,20,"And of the ten horns that were on its head, and of the other which came up, and before which three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look was greater than its fellows."
27,7,21,"I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;"
27,7,22,"Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom."
27,7,23,"Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces."
27,7,24,"And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings."
27,7,25,"And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time."
27,7,26,"But the court shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end."
27,7,27,"And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him."
27,7,28,"Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart."
27,8,1,"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first."
27,8,2,"And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai."
27,8,3,"Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last."
27,8,4,"I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great."
27,8,5,"And as I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes."
27,8,6,"And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran at him in the fury of his power."
27,8,7,"And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with rage against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand."
27,8,8,"Therefore the male goat grew very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."
27,8,9,"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land."
27,8,10,"And it grew great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them."
27,8,11,"Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down."
27,8,12,"And a host was given him to oppose the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it did this, and prospered."
27,8,13,"Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint who spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?"
27,8,14,"And he said unto me, For two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."
27,8,15,"And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man."
27,8,16,"And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said,"
27,8,17,"So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: that for the time of the end shall be the vision."
27,8,18,"Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright."
27,8,19,"And he said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the latter end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be."
27,8,20,"The ram which you saw having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia."
27,8,21,"And the male goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king."
27,8,22,"As for that horn being broken, and the four that stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall stand up out of that nation, but not with its power."
27,8,23,"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to their fullness, a king of bold countenance, and understanding riddles, shall stand up."
27,8,24,"And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy awesomely, and shall prosper, and thrive, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people."
27,8,25,"And through his cunning also he shall cause deceit to prosper under his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and without warning shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken, by no human hand."
27,8,26,"And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: therefore shut up the vision; for it shall be many days hence."
27,8,27,"And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it."
27,9,1,"In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the descendants of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;"
27,9,2,"In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood from the books the number of the years, of which the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem."
27,9,3,"And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:"
27,9,4,"And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and awesome God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;"
27,9,5,"We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from your precepts and from your judgments:"
27,9,6,"Neither have we hearkened unto your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land."
27,9,7,"O Lord, righteousness belongs unto you, but unto us shame of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you."
27,9,8,"O Lord, to us belongs shame of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you."
27,9,9,"To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;"
27,9,10,"Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets."
27,9,11,"Yea, all Israel have transgressed your law, even by departing, that they might not obey your voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him."
27,9,12,"And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done upon Jerusalem."
27,9,13,"As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil has come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand your truth."
27,9,14,"Therefore has the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he does: for we obeyed not his voice."
27,9,15,"And now, O Lord our God, who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and has gotten yourself renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly."
27,9,16,"O Lord, according to all your righteousness, I beseech you, let your anger and your fury be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have become a reproach to all that are about us."
27,9,17,"Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of your servant, and his supplications, and cause your face to shine upon your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake."
27,9,18,"O my God, incline your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by your name: for we do not present our supplications before you for our righteousness, but for your great mercies."
27,9,19,"O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for your own sake, O my God: for your city and your people are called by your name."
27,9,20,"And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;"
27,9,21,"Yea, while I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, reached me about the time of the evening offering."
27,9,22,"And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give you skill and understanding."
27,9,23,"At the beginning of your supplications the commandment came forth, and I have come to show you; for you are greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision."
27,9,24,"Seventy weeks are determined upon your people and upon your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy."
27,9,25,"Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah, the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublesome times."
27,9,26,"And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and its end shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined."
27,9,27,"And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate."
27,10,1,"In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision."
27,10,2,"In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks."
27,10,3,"I ate no pleasant food, neither came meat nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled."
27,10,4,"And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;"
27,10,5,"Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose waist was girded with fine gold of Uphaz:"
27,10,6,"His body also was like beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished bronze, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude."
27,10,7,"And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great trembling fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves."
27,10,8,"Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my vigor was turned in me into ruin, and I retained no strength."
27,10,9,"Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground."
27,10,10,"And, behold, a hand touched me, which made me tremble upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands."
27,10,11,"And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto you, and stand upright: for unto you am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling."
27,10,12,"Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come because of your words."
27,10,13,"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; for I had remained there with the kings of Persia."
27,10,14,"Now I have come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for the vision is for many days yet to come."
27,10,15,"And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb."
27,10,16,"And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, because of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength."
27,10,17,"For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me."
27,10,18,"Then there came again and touched me one having the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,"
27,10,19,"And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto you, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me."
27,10,20,"Then said he, Know you why I come unto you? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I have gone forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come."
27,10,21,"But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that upholds me in these things, but Michael your prince."
27,11,1,"Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him."
27,11,2,"And now will I show you the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than them all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece."
27,11,3,"And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will."
27,11,4,"And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these."
27,11,5,"And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion."
27,11,6,"And at the end of some years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of her authority; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times."
27,11,7,"But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his place, who shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:"
27,11,8,"And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north."
27,11,9,"So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land."
27,11,10,"But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress."
27,11,11,"And the king of the south shall be moved with rage, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand."
27,11,12,"And when he has taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it."
27,11,13,"For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much equipment."
27,11,14,"And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the violent men of your people shall exalt themselves to fulfill the vision; but they shall fall."
27,11,15,"So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a siege mound, and take the most fortified city: and the forces of the south shall not withstand, neither his choice troops, neither shall there be any strength to withstand."
27,11,16,"But he that comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed."
27,11,17,"He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, to destroy it: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him."
27,11,18,"After this shall he turn his face unto the coastlands, and shall take many: but a ruler for his own behalf shall bring the reproach brought by him to cease; with his reproach removed he shall cause it to turn back on him."
27,11,19,"Then he shall turn his face toward the fortress of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found."
27,11,20,"Then shall arise in his place a raiser of taxes in the glorious kingdom: but within a few days he shall be destroyed, but neither in anger, nor in battle."
27,11,21,"And in his place shall arise a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honor of royalty: but he shall come in peaceably, and seize the kingdom by flatteries."
27,11,22,"And with the force of a flood shall they be swept away from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant."
27,11,23,"And after the league is made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small number of people."
27,11,24,"He shall enter peaceably even into the richest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the plunder, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall devise his plans against the strongholds, but only for a time."
27,11,25,"And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall devise plans against him."
27,11,26,"Yea, they that feed of the portion of his rich food shall destroy him, and his army shall be swept away: and many shall fall down slain."
27,11,27,"And both these kings' hearts shall be to do evil, and they shall speak lies at the same table; but it shall not prosper: for the end shall yet be at the time appointed."
27,11,28,"Then shall he return into his land with great riches; but his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall work his will, and return to his own land."
27,11,29,"At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be like the former, or like the latter."
27,11,30,"For the ships of Kittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and rage against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and show favor toward them that forsake the holy covenant."
27,11,31,"And forces shall appear on his part, and they shall defile the sanctuary fortress, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall set up the abomination that makes desolate."
27,11,32,"And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flattery: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and take action."
27,11,33,"And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by plunder, many days."
27,11,34,"Now when they shall fall, they shall be aided with a little help: but many shall join to them with flattery."
27,11,35,"And some of them of understanding shall fall, to test them, and to purify them, and to make them white, until the time of the end: because it is yet for the time appointed."
27,11,36,"And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak astonishing things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the wrath is accomplished: for what has been determined shall be done."
27,11,37,"Neither shall he regard the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all."
27,11,38,"But in their place he shall honor the god of fortresses: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things."
27,11,39,"Thus shall he do in the strongest fortresses with a foreign god, which he shall acknowledge and advance its glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain."
27,11,40,"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south attack him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass through."
27,11,41,"He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and most of the children of Ammon."
27,11,42,"He shall stretch forth his hand also against the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape."
27,11,43,"But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall follow in his train."
27,11,44,"But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and to utterly sweep away many."
27,11,45,"And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him."
27,12,1,"And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which stands for the children of your people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time your people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book."
27,12,2,"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."
27,12,3,"And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever."
27,12,4,"But you, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."
27,12,5,"Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood two others, the one on this bank of the river, and the other on that bank of the river."
27,12,6,"And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, How long shall it be till the end of these wonders?"
27,12,7,"And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and swore by him that lives forever that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when he shall have accomplished the shattering of the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished."
27,12,8,"And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?"
27,12,9,"And he said, Go your way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end."
27,12,10,"Many shall be purified, and made white, and refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand."
27,12,11,"And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days."
27,12,12,"Blessed is he that waits, and comes to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days."
27,12,13,"But go you your way till the end: for you shall rest, and stand in your allotted place at the end of the days."
28,1,1,"The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel."
28,1,2,"The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea,"
28,1,3,"So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; who conceived, and bore him a son."
28,1,4,"And the LORD said unto him,"

28,1,6,"And she conceived again, and bore a daughter. And God said unto him,"

40,26,62,"And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answer you nothing? what is it which these witness against you?"
40,26,63,"But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God."
40,26,64,"Jesus said unto him,"
40,26,65,"Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now you have heard his blasphemy."
40,26,66,"What think you? They answered and said, He is guilty of death."
40,26,67,"Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others struck him with the palms of their hands,"
40,26,68,"Saying, Prophesy unto us, you Christ, Who is he that struck you?"
40,26,69,"Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard: and a maidservant came unto him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee."
40,26,70,"But he denied it before them all, saying, I know not what you say."
40,26,71,"And when he was gone out into the porch, another maidservant saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth."
40,26,72,"And again he denied it with an oath, I do not know the man."
40,26,73,"And after awhile came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them; for your speech betrays you."
40,26,74,"Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crowed."
40,26,75,"And Peter remembered the words of Jesus, who said unto him,"
40,27,1,"When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:"
40,27,2,"And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor."
40,27,3,"Then Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,"
40,27,4,"Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see you to that."
40,27,5,"And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself."
40,27,6,"And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood."
40,27,7,"And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in."
40,27,8,"Therefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day."
40,27,9,"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;"
40,27,10,"And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me."
40,27,11,"And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him,"
40,27,12,"And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing."
40,27,13,"Then said Pilate unto him, Hear you not how many things they witness against you?"
40,27,14,"And he answered him never a word; so that the governor marveled greatly."
40,27,15,"Now at that feast the governor was accustomed to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they desired."
40,27,16,"And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas."
40,27,17,"Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will you that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
40,27,18,"For he knew that for envy they had delivered him."
40,27,19,"When he was sat down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
40,27,20,"But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus."
40,27,21,"The governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two will you that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas."
40,27,22,"Pilate said unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ? They all said unto him, Let him be crucified."
40,27,23,"And the governor said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified."
40,27,24,"When Pilate saw that he could gain nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see you to it."
40,27,25,"Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children."
40,27,26,"Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified."
40,27,27,"Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers."
40,27,28,"And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe."
40,27,29,"And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!"
40,27,30,"And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and struck him on the head."
40,27,31,"And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off of him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him."
40,27,32,"And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross."
40,27,33,"And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,"
40,27,34,"They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink."
40,27,35,"And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,"
40,27,36,"And sitting down they watched him there;"
40,27,37,"And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
40,27,38,"Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left."
40,27,39,"And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,"
40,27,40,"And saying, You that destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself. If you be the Son of God, come down from the cross."
40,27,41,"Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, saying,"
40,27,42,"He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him."
40,27,43,"He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God."
40,27,44,"The thieves also, who were crucified with him, reviled him the same way."
40,27,45,"Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour."
40,27,46,"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,"
40,27,47,"Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calls for Elijah."
40,27,48,"And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink."
40,27,49,"The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."
40,27,50,"Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up his spirit."
40,27,51,"And, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks were split;"
40,27,52,"And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints that slept arose,"
40,27,53,"And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many."
40,27,54,"Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God."
40,27,55,"And many women were there beholding afar off, who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:"
40,27,56,"Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children."
40,27,57,"When the evening was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:"
40,27,58,"He went to Pilate, and begged for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered."
40,27,59,"And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,"
40,27,60,"And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher, and departed."
40,27,61,"And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulcher."
40,27,62,"Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,"
40,27,63,"Saying, Sir, we remember that this deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again."
40,27,64,"Command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first."
40,27,65,"Pilate said unto them, You have guards: go your way, make it as sure as you can."
40,27,66,"So they went, and made the sepulcher sure, sealing the stone, and setting a guard."
40,28,1,"At the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher."
40,28,2,"And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it."
40,28,3,"His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow:"
40,28,4,"And for fear of him the guards did shake, and became as dead men."
40,28,5,"And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not: for I know that you seek Jesus, who was crucified."
40,28,6,"He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay."
40,28,7,"And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall you see him: lo, I have told you."
40,28,8,"And they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word."
40,28,9,"And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying,"
40,28,10,"Then said Jesus unto them,"
40,28,11,"Now when they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and announced unto the chief priests all the things that were done."
40,28,12,"And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers,"
40,28,13,"Saying, Say this, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept."
40,28,14,"And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and protect you."
40,28,15,"So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day."
40,28,16,"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them."
40,28,17,"And when they saw him, they worshiped him: but some doubted."
40,28,18,"And Jesus came and spoke unto them, saying,"
40,28,19,""
40,28,20,""
41,1,1,"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;"
41,1,2,"As it is written in the prophets,"
41,1,3,"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
41,1,4,"John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins."
41,1,5,"And there went out unto him all the land of Judea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins."
41,1,6,"And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a belt of a skin about his waist; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;"
41,1,7,"And preached, saying, There comes one mightier than I after me, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose."
41,1,8,"I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
41,1,9,"And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan."
41,1,10,"And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:"
41,1,11,"And there came a voice from heaven, saying,"
41,1,12,"And immediately the Spirit drove him into the wilderness."
41,1,13,"And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him."
41,1,14,"Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,"
41,1,15,"And saying,"
41,1,16,"Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers."
41,1,17,"And Jesus said unto them,"
41,1,18,"And immediately they left their nets, and followed him."
41,1,19,"And when he had gone a little farther from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets."
41,1,20,"And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him."
41,1,21,"And they went into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught."
41,1,22,"And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes."
41,1,23,"And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,"
41,1,24,"Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you, who you are, the Holy One of God."
41,1,25,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying,"
41,1,26,"And when the unclean spirit had convulsed him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him."
41,1,27,"And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him."
41,1,28,"And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee."
41,1,29,"And immediately, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
41,1,30,"But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and immediately they told him of her."
41,1,31,"And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them."
41,1,32,"And at evening, when the sun had set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with demons."
41,1,33,"And all the city was gathered together at the door."
41,1,34,"And he healed many that were sick of various diseases, and cast out many demons; and allowed not the demons to speak, because they knew him."
41,1,35,"And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a lonely place, and there prayed."
41,1,36,"And Simon and they that were with him followed after him."
41,1,37,"And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek you."
41,1,38,"And he said unto them,"
41,1,39,"And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out demons."
41,1,40,"And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If you will, you can make me clean."
41,1,41,"And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and said unto him,"
41,1,42,"And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed."
41,1,43,"And he sternly charged him, and immediately sent him away;"
41,1,44,"And said unto him,"
41,1,45,"But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread abroad the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter."
41,2,1,"And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was told that he was in the house."
41,2,2,"And immediately many were gathered together, so much that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them."
41,2,3,"And they came unto him, bringing one, a paralytic, who was borne of four."
41,2,4,"And when they could not come near unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay."
41,2,5,"When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the paralytic,"
41,2,6,"But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,"
41,2,7,"Why does this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?"
41,2,8,"And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned among themselves, he said unto them,"

41,2,14,"And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and said unto him,"
41,2,15,"And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat to eat in his house, many tax collectors and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him."
41,2,16,"And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with tax collectors and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?"
41,2,17,"When Jesus heard it, he said unto them,"
41,2,18,"And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they came and said unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples fast not?"

41,3,9,"And he spoke to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him."
41,3,10,"For he had healed many; so much that they pressed upon him to touch him, as many as had diseases."

41,5,19,"But Jesus permitted him not, but said unto him,"
41,5,20,"And he departed, and began to announce in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel."
41,5,21,"And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, many people gathered unto him: and he was near unto the sea."
41,5,22,"And, behold, there came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,"
41,5,23,"And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death: I pray you, come and lay your hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live."
41,5,24,"And Jesus went with him; and many people followed him, and thronged him."
41,5,25,"And a certain woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years,"
41,5,26,"And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,"
41,5,27,"When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment."
41,5,28,"For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole."
41,5,29,"And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that disease."
41,5,30,"And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that power had gone out of him, turned about in the crowd, and said,"
41,5,31,"And his disciples said unto him, You see the multitude thronging you, and you say, Who touched me?"
41,5,32,"And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing."
41,5,33,"But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth."
41,5,34,"And he said unto her,"
41,5,35,"While he yet spoke, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain who said, Your daughter is dead: why trouble you the Teacher any further?"
41,5,36,"As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he said unto the ruler of the synagogue,"
41,5,37,"And he permitted no man to follow him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James."
41,5,38,"And he came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly."
41,5,39,"And when he came in, he said unto them,"
41,5,40,"And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he took the father and the mother of the child, and them that were with him, and entered in where the child was lying."
41,5,41,"And he took the child by the hand, and said unto her,"
41,5,42,"And immediately the girl arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment."
41,5,43,"And he charged them sternly that no man should know it; and told them that something should be given her to eat."
41,6,1,"And he went out from there, and came into his own country; and his disciples followed him."
41,6,2,"And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From where has this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?"
41,6,3,"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they took offense at him."
41,6,4,"But Jesus said unto them,"
41,6,5,"And he could there do no mighty work, except that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them."
41,6,6,"And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching."
41,6,7,"And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth two by two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;"
41,6,8,"And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only; no bag, no bread, no money in their purse:"
41,6,9,"But to wear sandals; and not put on two coats."
41,6,10,"And he said unto them,"
41,6,11,""
41,6,12,"And they went out, and preached that men should repent."
41,6,13,"And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them."
41,6,14,"And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him."
41,6,15,"Others said, It is Elijah. And others said, It is a prophet, or as one of the prophets."
41,6,16,"But when Herod heard of it, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead."
41,6,17,"For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her."
41,6,18,"For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
41,6,19,"Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:"
41,6,20,"For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and holy, and protected him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly."
41,6,21,"And when an opportune day was come, Herod on his birthday made a supper for his lords, high captains, and chief men of Galilee;"
41,6,22,"And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the girl, Ask of me whatsoever you will, and I will give it to you."
41,6,23,"And he swore unto her, Whatsoever you shall ask of me, I will give it to you, unto the half of my kingdom."
41,6,24,"And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist."
41,6,25,"And she came in immediately with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that you give me at once on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
41,6,26,"And the king was exceedingly sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes who sat with him, he would not reject her."
41,6,27,"And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,"
41,6,28,"And brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl: and the girl gave it to her mother."
41,6,29,"And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb."
41,6,30,"And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught."
41,6,31,"And he said unto them,"
41,6,32,"And they departed into a desert place by ship privately."
41,6,33,"And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran on foot out of all the cities, and came before them, and came together unto him."
41,6,34,"And Jesus, when he came out, saw many people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things."
41,6,35,"And when the day was now ending, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:"
41,6,36,"Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat."
41,6,37,"He answered and said unto them,"
41,6,38,"He said unto them,"
41,6,39,"And he commanded them to make all sit down by groups upon the green grass."
41,6,40,"And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties."
41,6,41,"And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all."
41,6,42,"And they did all eat, and were filled."
41,6,43,"And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes."
41,6,44,"And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men."
41,6,45,"And immediately he made his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people."
41,6,46,"And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray."
41,6,47,"And when evening was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land."
41,6,48,"And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them."
41,6,49,"But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it was a spirit, and cried out:"
41,6,50,"For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and said unto them,"
41,6,51,"And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were much amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered."
41,6,52,"For they understood not the miracle of the loaves: for their hearts were hardened."
41,6,53,"And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore."
41,6,54,"And when they were come out of the ship, immediately they knew him,"
41,6,55,"And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was."
41,6,56,"And wherever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole."
41,7,1,"Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem."
41,7,2,"And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashed, hands, they found fault."
41,7,3,"For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands often, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders."
41,7,4,"And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, bronze vessels, and of tables."
41,7,5,"Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not your disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?"

42,1,36,"And, behold, your cousin Elizabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren."

42,1,44,"For, lo, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy."
42,1,45,"And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord."
42,1,46,"And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord,"
42,1,47,"And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior."
42,1,48,"For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed."
42,1,49,"For he that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy is his name."
42,1,50,"And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation."
42,1,51,"He has showed strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts."
42,1,52,"He has put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree."
42,1,53,"He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he has sent empty away."
42,1,54,"He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;"
42,1,55,"As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his descendants forever."
42,1,56,"And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house."
42,1,57,"Now Elizabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son."
42,1,58,"And her neighbors and her cousins heard how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her."
42,1,59,"And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zachariah, after the name of his father."
42,1,60,"And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John."
42,1,61,"And they said unto her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name."
42,1,62,"And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called."
42,1,63,"And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marveled all."
42,1,64,"And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God."
42,1,65,"And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were spread abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea."
42,1,66,"And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him."
42,1,67,"And his father Zachariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,"
42,1,68,"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,"
42,1,69,"And has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;"
42,1,70,"As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began:"
42,1,71,"That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;"
42,1,72,"To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;"
42,1,73,"The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,"
42,1,74,"That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,"
42,1,75,"In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life."
42,1,76,"And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Highest: for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;"
42,1,77,"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,"
42,1,78,"Through the tender mercy of our God; by which the dawn from on high has visited us,"
42,1,79,"To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace."
42,1,80,"And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel."
42,2,1,"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed."
42,2,2,"(And this taxing was first made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.)"
42,2,3,"And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city."
42,2,4,"And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)"
42,2,5,"To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child."
42,2,6,"And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered."
42,2,7,"And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn."
42,2,8,"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night."
42,2,9,"And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were much afraid."
42,2,10,"And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."
42,2,11,"For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord."
42,2,12,"And this shall be a sign unto you; You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."
42,2,13,"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,"
42,2,14,"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."
42,2,15,"And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord has made known unto us."
42,2,16,"And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger."
42,2,17,"And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child."
42,2,18,"And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds."
42,2,19,"But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart."
42,2,20,"And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them."
42,2,21,"And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, who was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb."
42,2,22,"And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;"
42,2,23,"(As it is written in the law of the Lord,"
42,2,24,"And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord,"
42,2,25,"And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him."
42,2,26,"And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ."
42,2,27,"And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,"
42,2,28,"Then he took him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,"
42,2,29,"Lord, now let your servant depart in peace, according to your word:"
42,2,30,"For my eyes have seen your salvation,"
42,2,31,"Which you have prepared before the face of all people;"
42,2,32,"A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel."
42,2,33,"And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him."
42,2,34,"And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;"
42,2,35,"(Yea, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
42,2,36,"And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;"
42,2,37,"And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, who departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day."
42,2,38,"And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem."
42,2,39,"And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth."
42,2,40,"And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him."
42,2,41,"Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover."
42,2,42,"And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast."
42,2,43,"And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it."
42,2,44,"But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances."
42,2,45,"And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him."
42,2,46,"And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions."
42,2,47,"And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers."
42,2,48,"And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why have you thus dealt with us? behold, your father and I have sought you sorrowing."
42,2,49,"And he said unto them,"
42,2,50,"And they understood not the saying which he spoke unto them."
42,2,51,"And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart."
42,2,52,"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man."
42,3,1,"Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,"
42,3,2,"Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness."
42,3,3,"And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;"
42,3,4,"As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."
42,3,5,"Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;"
42,3,6,"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God."
42,3,7,"Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
42,3,8,"Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham."
42,3,9,"And now also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which brings not forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire."
42,3,10,"And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?"
42,3,11,"He answered and said unto them, He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he that has food, let him do likewise."
42,3,12,"Then came also tax collectors to be baptized, and said unto him, Teacher, what shall we do?"
42,3,13,"And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you."
42,3,14,"And the soldiers likewise asked of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages."
42,3,15,"And as the people were in expectation, and all men questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether he was the Christ, or not;"
42,3,16,"John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I comes, the thong of whose shoes I am not worthy to untie: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire:"
42,3,17,"Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
42,3,18,"And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people."
42,3,19,"But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,"
42,3,20,"Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison."
42,3,21,"Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that when Jesus also was baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,"
42,3,22,"And the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said,"
42,3,23,"And Jesus himself was about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, who was the son of Heli,"
42,3,24,"Who was the son of Matthat, who was the son of Levi, who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Jannai, who was the son of Joseph,"
42,3,25,"Who was the son of Mattathias, who was the son of Amos, who was the son of Nahum, who was the son of Esli, who was the son of Naggai,"
42,3,26,"Who was the son of Maath, who was the son of Mattathias, who was the son of Semein, who was the son of Josech, who was the son of Joda,"
42,3,27,"Who was the son of Joanan, who was the son of Rhesa, who was the son of Zerubbabel, who was the son of Shealtiel, who was the son of Neri,"
42,3,28,"Who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Addi, who was the son of Cosam, who was the son of Elmodam, who was the son of Er,"
42,3,29,"Who was the son of Joshua, who was the son of Eliezer, who was the son of Jorim, who was the son of Matthat, who was the son of Levi,"
42,3,30,"Who was the son of Simeon, who was the son of Judah, who was the son of Joseph, who was the son of Jonam who was the son of Eliakim,"
42,3,31,"Who was the son of Melea, who was the son of Menna, who was the son of Mattatha, who was the son of Nathan, who was the son of David,"
42,3,32,"Who was the son of Jesse, who was the son of Obed, who was the son of Boaz, who was the son of Salmon, who was the son of Nahshon,"
42,3,33,"Who was the son of Amminadab, who was the son of Ram, who was the son of Hezron, who was the son of Perez, who was the son of Judah,"
42,3,34,"Who was the son of Jacob, who was the son of Isaac, who was the son of Abraham, who was the son of Terah, who was the son of Nahor,"
42,3,35,"Who was the son of Serug, who was the son of Reu, who was the son of Peleg, who was the son of Eber, who was the son of Shelah,"
42,3,36,"Who was the son of Cainan, who was the son of Arphaxad, who was the son of Shem, who was the son of Noah, who was the son of Lamech,"
42,3,37,"Who was the son of Mathuselah, who was the son of Enoch, who was the son of Jared, who was the son of Mahalalel, who was the son of Cainan,"
42,3,38,"Who was the son of Enos, who was the son of Seth, who was the son of Adam, who was the son of God."
42,4,1,"And Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,"
42,4,2,"Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered."
42,4,3,"And the devil said unto him, If you are the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread."
42,4,4,"And Jesus answered him, saying,"
42,4,5,"And the devil, taking him up into a high mountain, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time."
42,4,6,"And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give you, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it."
42,4,7,"If you therefore will worship me, all shall be yours."
42,4,8,"And Jesus answered and said unto him,"
42,4,9,"And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here:"
42,4,10,"For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you:"
42,4,11,"And in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone."
42,4,12,"And Jesus answering said unto him,"
42,4,13,"And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him for a season."
42,4,14,"And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about."
42,4,15,"And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all."
42,4,16,"And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up to read."
42,4,17,"And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,"
42,4,18,""
42,4,19,""
42,4,20,"And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him."
42,4,21,"And he began to say unto them,"
42,4,22,"And all bore him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?"
42,4,23,"And he said unto them,"
42,4,24,"And he said,"
42,4,25,""
42,4,26,""
42,4,27,""
42,4,28,"And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,"
42,4,29,"And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong."
42,4,30,"But he passing through the midst of them went his way,"
42,4,31,"And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days."
42,4,32,"And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power."
42,4,33,"And in the synagogue there was a man, who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and cried out with a loud voice,"
42,4,34,"Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know who you are; the Holy One of God."
42,4,35,"And Jesus rebuked him, saying,"
42,4,36,"And they were all amazed, and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out."
42,4,37,"And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about."
42,4,38,"And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was ill with a high fever; and they besought him for her."
42,4,39,"And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them."
42,4,40,"Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with various diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them."
42,4,41,"And demons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, You are Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them permitted them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ."
42,4,42,"And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and would have kept him, that he should not depart from them."
42,4,43,"And he said unto them,"
42,4,44,"And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee."
42,5,1,"And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,"
42,5,2,"And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets."
42,5,3,"And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and asked him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship."
42,5,4,"Now when he had ceased speaking, he said unto Simon,"
42,5,5,"And Simon answering said unto him, Teacher, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at your word I will let down the net."
42,5,6,"And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish: and their net broke."
42,5,7,"And they beckoned unto their partners, who were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink."
42,5,8,"When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
42,5,9,"For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the catch of the fish which they had taken:"
42,5,10,"And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon,"
42,5,11,"And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him."
42,5,12,"And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."
42,5,13,"And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying,"
42,5,14,"And he charged him to tell no man:"
42,5,15,"But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities."
42,5,16,"And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed."
42,5,17,"And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them."
42,5,18,"And, behold, men brought in a bed a man who was a paralytic: and they sought a way to bring him in, and to lay him before him."
42,5,19,"And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his bed into the midst before Jesus."
42,5,20,"And when he saw their faith, he said unto him,"
42,5,21,"And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
42,5,22,"But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them,"
42,5,23,""
42,5,24,""
42,5,25,"And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that on which he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God."
42,5,26,"And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today."
42,5,27,"And after these things he went forth, and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office: and he said unto him,"
42,5,28,"And he left all, rose up, and followed him."
42,5,29,"And Levi made himself a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of tax collectors and of others that sat down with them."
42,5,30,"But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
42,5,31,"And Jesus answering said unto them,"
42,5,32,""
42,5,33,"And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but you eat and drink?"
42,5,34,"And he said unto them,"

42,6,3,"And Jesus answering them said,"
42,6,4,""
42,6,5,"And he said unto them,"
42,6,6,"And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered."
42,6,7,"And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him."
42,6,8,"But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand,"
42,6,9,"Then said Jesus unto them,"
42,6,10,"And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man,"
42,6,11,"And they were filled with fury; and discussed one with another what they might do to Jesus."
42,6,12,"And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God."
42,6,13,"And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;"

42,23,2,"And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King."
42,23,3,"And Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said,"
42,23,4,"Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man."
42,23,5,"And they were the more urgent, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place."
42,23,6,"When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean."
42,23,7,"And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time."
42,23,8,"And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad: for he was desirous to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him."
42,23,9,"Then he questioned him with many words; but he answered him nothing."
42,23,10,"And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him."
42,23,11,"And Herod with his men of war despised him, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate."
42,23,12,"And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves."
42,23,13,"And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,"
42,23,14,"Said unto them, You have brought this man unto me, as one that perverts the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man concerning those things of which you accuse him:"
42,23,15,"No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death was done by him."
42,23,16,"I will therefore chastise him, and release him."
42,23,17,"(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)"
42,23,18,"And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:"
42,23,19,"(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)"
42,23,20,"Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them."
42,23,21,"But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him."
42,23,22,"And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go."
42,23,23,"And they were urgent with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed."
42,23,24,"And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they demanded."
42,23,25,"And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will."
42,23,26,"And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming in from the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus."
42,23,27,"And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him."
42,23,28,"But Jesus turning unto them said,"
42,23,29,""
42,23,30,""
42,23,31,""
42,23,32,"And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death."
42,23,33,"And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left."
42,23,34,"Then said Jesus,"
42,23,35,"And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is Christ, the chosen of God."
42,23,36,"And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,"
42,23,37,"And saying, If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."
42,23,38,"And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
42,23,39,"And one of the malefactors who were hanged railed at him, saying, If you are Christ, save yourself and us."
42,23,40,"But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?"
42,23,41,"And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss."
42,23,42,"And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
42,23,43,"And Jesus said unto him,"
42,23,44,"And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour."
42,23,45,"And the sun was darkened, and the curtain of the temple was torn in the middle."
42,23,46,"And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said,"
42,23,47,"Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man."
42,23,48,"And all the people that came together to see that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned."
42,23,49,"And all his acquaintances, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things."
42,23,50,"And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a member of the council and he was a good man, and just:"
42,23,51,"(The same had not consented to the council and the action of them;) he was of Arimathea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God."
42,23,52,"This man went unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus."
42,23,53,"And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that was hewn in stone, in which never man before was laid."
42,23,54,"And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath was coming on."
42,23,55,"And the women also, who came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulcher, and how his body was laid."
42,23,56,"And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment."
42,24,1,"Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others came with them."
42,24,2,"And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher."
42,24,3,"And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus."
42,24,4,"And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:"
42,24,5,"And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the ground, they said unto them, Why seek you the living among the dead?"
42,24,6,"He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke unto you when he was yet in Galilee,"
42,24,7,"Saying,"
42,24,8,"And they remembered his words,"
42,24,9,"And returned from the sepulcher, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest."
42,24,10,"It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, who told these things unto the apostles."
42,24,11,"And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not."
42,24,12,"Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulcher; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which had come to pass."
42,24,13,"And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs."
42,24,14,"And they talked together of all these things which had happened."
42,24,15,"And it came to pass, that, while they discussed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them."
42,24,16,"But their eyes were held that they should not know him."
42,24,17,"And he said unto them,"
42,24,18,"And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Are you a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things which have come to pass there in these days?"
42,24,19,"And he said unto them,"
42,24,20,"And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him."
42,24,21,"But we hoped that it was he who should have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, today is the third day since these things were done."
42,24,22,"Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, who were early at the sepulcher;"
42,24,23,"And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive."
42,24,24,"And certain of them who were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not."
42,24,25,"Then he said unto them,"
42,24,26,""
42,24,27,"And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself."
42,24,28,"And they drew near unto the village, where they were going: and he made as though he would have gone further."
42,24,29,"But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them."
42,24,30,"And it came to pass, as he sat to eat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave to them."
42,24,31,"And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight."
42,24,32,"And they said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?"
42,24,33,"And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,"
42,24,34,"Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon."
42,24,35,"And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known to them in the breaking of bread."
42,24,36,"And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said unto them,"
42,24,37,"But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed that they had seen a spirit."
42,24,38,"And he said unto them,"
42,24,39,""
42,24,40,"And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet."
42,24,41,"And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them,"
42,24,42,"And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb."
42,24,43,"And he took it, and did eat before them."
42,24,44,"And he said unto them,"
42,24,45,"Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,"
42,24,46,"And said unto them,"

42,24,48,""
42,24,49,""
42,24,50,"And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them."
42,24,51,"And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven."
42,24,52,"And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:"
42,24,53,"And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen."
43,1,1,"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
43,1,2,"The same was in the beginning with God."
43,1,3,"All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made."
43,1,4,"In him was life; and the life was the light of men."
43,1,5,"And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness overcame it not."
43,1,6,"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John."
43,1,7,"The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe."
43,1,8,"He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light."
43,1,9,"That was the true Light, that lights every man that comes into the world."
43,1,10,"He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not."
43,1,11,"He came unto his own, and his own received him not."
43,1,12,"But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the children of God, even to them that believe on his name:"
43,1,13,"Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
43,1,14,"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."
43,1,15,"John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me."
43,1,16,"And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace."
43,1,17,"For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
43,1,18,"No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him."
43,1,19,"And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?"
43,1,20,"And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ."
43,1,21,"And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No."
43,1,22,"Then said they unto him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What say you of yourself?"
43,1,23,"He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah."
43,1,24,"And they who were sent were of the Pharisees."
43,1,25,"And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptize you then, if you are not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?"
43,1,26,"John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom you know not;"
43,1,27,"He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's thong I am not worthy to unloose."
43,1,28,"These things were done in Bethany beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing."
43,1,29,"The next day John saw Jesus coming unto him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world."
43,1,30,"This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who is preferred before me: for he was before me."
43,1,31,"And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water."
43,1,32,"And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him."
43,1,33,"And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me,"
43,1,34,"And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God."
43,1,35,"Again the next day John stood, and two of his disciples;"
43,1,36,"And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!"
43,1,37,"And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus."
43,1,38,"Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said unto them,"
43,1,39,"He said unto them,"
43,1,40,"One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother."
43,1,41,"He first found his own brother Simon, and said unto him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ."
43,1,42,"And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said,"
43,1,43,"The day following Jesus went forth into Galilee, and found Philip, and said unto him,"
43,1,44,"Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."
43,1,45,"Philip found Nathanael, and said unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
43,1,46,"And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said unto him, Come and see."
43,1,47,"Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him,"
43,1,48,"Nathanael said unto him, Where do you know me? Jesus answered and said unto him,"
43,1,49,"Nathanael answered and said unto him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."
43,1,50,"Jesus answered and said unto him,"
43,1,51,"And he said unto him,"
43,2,1,"On the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:"
43,2,2,"And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage."
43,2,3,"And when they ran out of wine, the mother of Jesus said unto him, They have no wine."
43,2,4,"Jesus said unto her,"
43,2,5,"His mother said unto the servants, whatsoever he says unto you, do it."
43,2,6,"And there were set there six water pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing twenty or thirty gallons each."
43,2,7,"Jesus said unto them,"
43,2,8,"And he said unto them,"
43,2,9,"When the steward of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not from where it was: (but the servants who drew the water knew;) the steward of the feast called the bridegroom,"
43,2,10,"And said unto him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now."
43,2,11,"This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him."
43,2,12,"After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days."
43,2,13,"And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,"
43,2,14,"And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:"
43,2,15,"And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;"
43,2,16,"And said unto them that sold doves,"
43,2,17,"And his disciples remembered that it was written,"
43,2,18,"Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign show you unto us, seeing that you do these things?"
43,2,19,"Jesus answered and said unto them,"
43,2,20,"Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?"
43,2,21,"But he spoke of the temple of his body."
43,2,22,"When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said."
43,2,23,"Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did."
43,2,24,"But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,"
43,2,25,"And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man."
43,3,1,"There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:"
43,3,2,"The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him."
43,3,3,"Jesus answered and said unto him,"
43,3,4,"Nicodemus said unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"

43,3,24,"For John was not yet cast into prison."
43,3,25,"Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying."
43,3,26,"And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bear witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him."
43,3,27,"John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven."
43,3,28,"You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him."

43,4,54,"This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he came out of Judea into Galilee."
43,5,1,"After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
43,5,2,"Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches."
43,5,3,"In these lay a great multitude of invalid folk, of blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water."
43,5,4,"For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had."
43,5,5,"And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty and eight years."
43,5,6,"When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been now a long time in that condition, he said unto him,"
43,5,7,"The invalid man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me."
43,5,8,"Jesus said unto him,"
43,5,9,"And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and that same day was the sabbath."
43,5,10,"The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your bed."
43,5,11,"He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me,"
43,5,12,"Then asked they him, What man is that who said unto you, Take up your bed, and walk?"
43,5,13,"And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had taken himself away, a multitude being in that place."
43,5,14,"Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said unto him,"
43,5,15,"The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, who had made him whole."
43,5,16,"And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day."
43,5,17,"But Jesus answered them,"
43,5,18,"Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God."

43,6,16,"And when evening was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,"
43,6,17,"And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them."

43,11,25,"Jesus said unto her,"
43,11,26,""
43,11,27,"She said unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world."
43,11,28,"And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is come, and calls for you."
43,11,29,"As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him."
43,11,30,"Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him."
43,11,31,"The Jews then who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goes unto the grave to weep there."
43,11,32,"Then when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
43,11,33,"When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in his spirit, and was troubled,"
43,11,34,"And said,"
43,11,35,"Jesus wept."
43,11,36,"Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!"
43,11,37,"And some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"
43,11,38,"Jesus therefore again groaning in himself came to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it."
43,11,39,"Jesus said,"
43,11,40,"Jesus said unto her,"
43,11,41,"Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said,"
43,11,42,""
43,11,43,"And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,"
43,11,44,"And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes: and his face was bound about with a cloth. Jesus said unto them,"
43,11,45,"Then many of the Jews who came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him."
43,11,46,"But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done."
43,11,47,"Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many miracles."
43,11,48,"If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation."
43,11,49,"And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, You know nothing at all,"
43,11,50,"Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not."
43,11,51,"And this spoke he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;"
43,11,52,"And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad."
43,11,53,"Then from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death."
43,11,54,"Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went from there unto the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples."
43,11,55,"And the Jews' passover was near at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves."
43,11,56,"Then sought they for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think you, that he will not come to the feast?"
43,11,57,"Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him."
43,12,1,"Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead."
43,12,2,"There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him."
43,12,3,"Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment."
43,12,4,"Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who would betray him,"
43,12,5,"Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?"
43,12,6,"This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put therein."
43,12,7,"Then said Jesus,"
43,12,8,""
43,12,9,"Many people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead."
43,12,10,"But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;"
43,12,11,"Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus."
43,12,12,"On the next day many people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,"
43,12,13,"Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord."
43,12,14,"And Jesus, when he had found a young donkey, sat thereon; as it is written,"
43,12,15,""
43,12,16,"These things understood not his disciples at first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him."
43,12,17,"The people therefore that were with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore record."
43,12,18,"For this cause the people also met him, for they heard that he had done this miracle."
43,12,19,"The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Do you see how you can do nothing? behold, the world is gone after him."
43,12,20,"And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:"
43,12,21,"The same came therefore to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired of him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus."
43,12,22,"Philip came and told Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip told Jesus."

43,12,37,"But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:"
43,12,38,"That the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
43,12,39,"Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,"
43,12,40,"He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, and be converted, and I should heal them."
43,12,41,"These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him."
43,12,42,"Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:"
43,12,43,"For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God."

43,13,5,"After that he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded."
43,13,6,"Then came he to Simon Peter: and Peter said unto him, Lord, do you wash my feet?"

43,19,18,"Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst."
43,19,19,"And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS."
43,19,20,"This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin."
43,19,21,"Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews."
43,19,22,"Pilate answered, What I have written I have written."
43,19,23,"Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout."
43,19,24,"They said therefore among themselves, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which said,"
43,19,25,"Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene."
43,19,26,"When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said unto his mother,"
43,19,27,"Then said he to the disciple,"
43,19,28,"After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said,"
43,19,29,"Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth."
43,19,30,"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said,"
43,19,31,"The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was a high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away."
43,19,32,"Then came the soldiers, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him."
43,19,33,"But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:"
43,19,34,"But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water."
43,19,35,"And he that saw it bares record, and his record is true: and he knows that he says the truth, that you might believe."
43,19,36,"For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken."
43,19,37,"And again another scripture says,"
43,19,38,"And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him permission. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus."
43,19,39,"And there came also Nicodemus, who at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight."
43,19,40,"Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury."
43,19,41,"Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, in which was never man yet laid."
43,19,42,"There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulcher was near at hand."
43,20,1,"The first day of the week came Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulcher, and saw the stone taken away from the sepulcher."
43,20,2,"Then she ran, and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him."
43,20,3,"Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher."
43,20,4,"So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulcher."
43,20,5,"And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen cloths lying there; yet went he not in."
43,20,6,"Then came Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and saw the linen cloths lying,"
43,20,7,"And the cloth, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself."
43,20,8,"Then went in also that other disciple, who came first to the sepulcher, and he saw, and believed."
43,20,9,"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead."
43,20,10,"Then the disciples went away again unto their own home"
43,20,11,"But Mary stood outside at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,"
43,20,12,"And saw two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain."
43,20,13,"And they said unto her, Woman, why weep you? She said unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him."
43,20,14,"And when she had thus spoke, she turned back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus."
43,20,15,"Jesus said unto her,"
43,20,16,"Jesus said unto her,"
43,20,17,"Jesus said unto her,"
43,20,18,"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her."
43,20,19,"Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and said unto them,"
43,20,20,"And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord."
43,20,21,"Then said Jesus to them again,"
43,20,22,"And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said unto them,"
43,20,23,""
43,20,24,"But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came."
43,20,25,"The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe."
43,20,26,"And after eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said,"
43,20,27,"Then said he to Thomas,"
43,20,28,"And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God."
43,20,29,"Jesus said unto him,"
43,20,30,"And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:"
43,20,31,"But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name."
43,21,1,"After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and in this way showed he himself."
43,21,2,"There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples."
43,21,3,"Simon Peter said unto them, I am going fishing. They said unto him, We also will go with you. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing."
43,21,4,"But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus."
43,21,5,"Then Jesus said unto them,"
43,21,6,"And he said unto them,"
43,21,7,"Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girded his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea."
43,21,8,"And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fish."
43,21,9,"As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread."
43,21,10,"Jesus said unto them,"
43,21,11,"Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fish, a hundred and fifty and three: and although there were so many, yet was not the net broken."
43,21,12,"Jesus said unto them,"
43,21,13,"Jesus then came, and took bread, and gave to them, and fish likewise."
43,21,14,"This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead."
43,21,15,"So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter,"
43,21,16,"He said to him again the second time,"
43,21,17,"He said unto him the third time,"
43,21,18,""
43,21,19,"This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said unto him,"
43,21,20,"Then Peter, turning about, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrays you?"
43,21,21,"Peter seeing him said to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?"
43,21,22,"Jesus said unto him,"
43,21,23,"Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but,"
43,21,24,"This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true."
43,21,25,"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen."
44,1,1,"The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,"
44,1,2,"Until the day in which he was taken up, after he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:"
44,1,3,"To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:"
44,1,4,"And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father,"
44,1,5,""
44,1,6,"When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?"
44,1,7,"And he said unto them,"
44,1,8,""
44,1,9,"And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight."
44,1,10,"And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;"
44,1,11,"Who also said, You men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven."
44,1,12,"Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey."
44,1,13,"And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the brother of James."
44,1,14,"These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers."
44,1,15,"And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about a hundred and twenty,)"
44,1,16,"Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus."
44,1,17,"For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry."
44,1,18,"Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his insides gushed out."
44,1,19,"And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; since that field is called in their proper tongue, Akeldama, that is to say, The field of blood."
44,1,20,"For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his office let another take."
44,1,21,"Therefore of these men who have accompanied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,"
44,1,22,"Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection."
44,1,23,"And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias."
44,1,24,"And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which of these two you have chosen,"
44,1,25,"That he may take part in this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place."
44,1,26,"And they cast their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles."
44,2,1,"And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place."
44,2,2,"And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting."
44,2,3,"And there appeared unto them separated tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them."
44,2,4,"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance."
44,2,5,"And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven."
44,2,6,"Now when this was sounded abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because every man heard them speak in his own language."
44,2,7,"And they were all amazed and marveled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these who speak Galileans?"
44,2,8,"And how hear we every man in our own tongue, in which we were born?"
44,2,9,"Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,"

44,2,12,"And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What means this?"
44,2,13,"Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine."
44,2,14,"But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, You men of Judea, and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:"
44,2,15,"For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day."

44,2,38,"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
44,2,39,"For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call."

44,2,41,"Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls."
44,2,42,"And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers."
44,2,43,"And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles."
44,2,44,"And all that believed were together, and had all things common;"
44,2,45,"And sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all men, as every man had need."
44,2,46,"And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their food with gladness and sincerity of heart,"
44,2,47,"Praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as were being saved."
44,3,1,"Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour."

44,3,12,"And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?"

44,4,13,"Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ordinary men, they marveled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus."
44,4,14,"And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it."
44,4,15,"But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,"

44,4,17,"But that it spread no further among the people, let us sternly threaten them, that they speak no longer to any man in this name."

44,4,31,"And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness."
44,4,32,"And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that any of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common."
44,4,33,"And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all."
44,4,34,"Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,"
44,4,35,"And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need."
44,4,36,"And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of encouragement,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,"
44,4,37,"Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet."
44,5,1,"But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,"
44,5,2,"And kept back part of the price, his wife also knowing it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet."
44,5,3,"But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?"
44,5,4,"While it remained, was it not your own? and after it was sold, was it not in your own power? why have you conceived this thing in your heart? you have not lied unto men, but unto God."
44,5,5,"And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and died: and great fear came on all them that heard these things."
44,5,6,"And the young men arose, wrapped him up, and carried him out, and buried him."
44,5,7,"And it was about the space of three hours later, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in."
44,5,8,"And Peter said unto her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much."
44,5,9,"Then Peter said unto her, How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them who have buried your husband are at the door, and shall carry you out."
44,5,10,"Then she fell down immediately at his feet, and died: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband."
44,5,11,"And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things."
44,5,12,"And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders done among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch."
44,5,13,"And of the rest dared no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them."
44,5,14,"And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)"
44,5,15,"So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and pallets, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them."
44,5,16,"There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and those who were tormented with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one."
44,5,17,"Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,"
44,5,18,"And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison."
44,5,19,"But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,"
44,5,20,"Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
44,5,21,"And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought."
44,5,22,"But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,"
44,5,23,"Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing outside before the doors: but when we had opened it, we found no man within."
44,5,24,"Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they were perplexed of what might come of this."
44,5,25,"Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people."
44,5,26,"Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned."
44,5,27,"And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,"
44,5,28,"Saying, Did not we strictly command you that you should not teach in this name? and, behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us."
44,5,29,"Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men."
44,5,30,"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree."
44,5,31,"Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins."
44,5,32,"And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to them that obey him."
44,5,33,"When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them."
44,5,34,"Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, held in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles outside a little while;"
44,5,35,"And said unto them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do concerning these men."
44,5,36,"For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and came to nothing."
44,5,37,"After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed."
44,5,38,"And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing:"
44,5,39,"But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it; lest perhaps you be found even to fight against God."
44,5,40,"And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go."
44,5,41,"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name."
44,5,42,"And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ."
44,6,1,"And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution."
44,6,2,"Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reasonable that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables."
44,6,3,"Therefore, brethren, pick out from among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business."
44,6,4,"But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word."
44,6,5,"And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus a proselyte of Antioch:"
44,6,6,"Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them."
44,6,7,"And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith."
44,6,8,"And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people."
44,6,9,"Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen."
44,6,10,"And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke."
44,6,11,"Then they bribed men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God."
44,6,12,"And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,"
44,6,13,"And set up false witnesses, who said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:"
44,6,14,"For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us."
44,6,15,"And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel."
44,7,1,"Then said the high priest, Are these things so?"
44,7,2,"And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,"
44,7,3,"And said unto him, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and come into the land which I shall show you."
44,7,4,"Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Haran: and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, in which you now dwell."
44,7,5,"And he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his descendants after him, when as yet he had no child."
44,7,6,"And God spoke in this way,"
44,7,7,""
44,7,8,"And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs."
44,7,9,"And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,"
44,7,10,"And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house."
44,7,11,"Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance."
44,7,12,"But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first."
44,7,13,"And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh."
44,7,14,"Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls."
44,7,15,"So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,"
44,7,16,"And were carried over into Shechem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem."
44,7,17,"But when the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,"
44,7,18,"Till another king arose, who knew not Joseph."
44,7,19,"The same dealt craftily with our kindred, and ill-treated our fathers, so that they exposed their infants, to the end that they might not live."
44,7,20,"In which time Moses was born, and was exceedingly fair, and was nourished in his father's house three months:"
44,7,21,"And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and reared him as her own son."
44,7,22,"And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds."
44,7,23,"And when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel."
44,7,24,"And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:"
44,7,25,"For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not."
44,7,26,"And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and would have reconciled them again, saying, Sirs, you are brethren; why do you wrong one to another?"
44,7,27,"But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?"
44,7,28,"Will you kill me, as you did the Egyptian yesterday?"
44,7,29,"Then fled Moses at this saying, and was an exile in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons."
44,7,30,"And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush."
44,7,31,"When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,"
44,7,32,"Saying,"
44,7,33,"Then said the Lord to him,"
44,7,34,""
44,7,35,"This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush."
44,7,36,"He brought them out, after he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years."
44,7,37,"This is that Moses, who said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall you hear."
44,7,38,"This is he, that was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received the living oracles to give unto us:"
44,7,39,"Whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,"
44,7,40,"Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him."
44,7,41,"And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands."
44,7,42,"Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets,"
44,7,43,""
44,7,44,"Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen."
44,7,45,"Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Joshua into the possession of the nations, which God drove out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;"
44,7,46,"Who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob."
44,7,47,"But Solomon built him a house."
44,7,48,"Yet the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as says the prophet,"
44,7,49,""
44,7,50,""
44,7,51,"You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers did, so do you."
44,7,52,"Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them who showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:"
44,7,53,"Who have received the law as delivered by angels, and have not kept it."
44,7,54,"When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth."
44,7,55,"But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,"
44,7,56,"And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God."
44,7,57,"Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,"
44,7,58,"And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul."
44,7,59,"And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
44,7,60,"And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep."
44,8,1,"And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles."
44,8,2,"And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him."
44,8,3,"As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and dragging off men and women committed them to prison."
44,8,4,"Therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word."
44,8,5,"Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them."
44,8,6,"And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did."
44,8,7,"For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many that were paralyzed, and that were lame, were healed."
44,8,8,"And there was great joy in that city."
44,8,9,"But there was a certain man, called Simon, who previously in the same city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one:"
44,8,10,"To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God."
44,8,11,"And to him they had regard, because for a long time he had amazed them with sorceries."
44,8,12,"But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."
44,8,13,"Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done."
44,8,14,"Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:"
44,8,15,"Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:"
44,8,16,"(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)"
44,8,17,"Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit."
44,8,18,"And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,"
44,8,19,"Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit."
44,8,20,"But Peter said unto him, Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money."
44,8,21,"You have neither part nor lot in this matter: for your heart is not right in the sight of God."
44,8,22,"Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you."
44,8,23,"For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity."
44,8,24,"Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the Lord for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come upon me."
44,8,25,"And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans."
44,8,26,"And the angel of the Lord spoke unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert."
44,8,27,"And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,"
44,8,28,"Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Isaiah the prophet."
44,8,29,"Then the Spirit said unto Philip,"
44,8,30,"And Philip ran to him, and heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you understand what you read?"
44,8,31,"And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him."
44,8,32,"The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:"
44,8,33,"In his humiliation his justice was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth."
44,8,34,"And the eunuch asked Philip, and said, I pray you, of whom speaks the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?"
44,8,35,"Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus."
44,8,36,"And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what does hinder me to be baptized?"
44,8,37,"And Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, you may. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
44,8,38,"And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him."
44,8,39,"And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing."
44,8,40,"But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea."
44,9,1,"And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,"
44,9,2,"And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem."
44,9,3,"And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:"
44,9,4,"And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him,"
44,9,5,"And he said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said,"
44,9,6,"And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do? And the Lord said unto him,"
44,9,7,"And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man."
44,9,8,"And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus."
44,9,9,"And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink."
44,9,10,"And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision,"
44,9,11,"And the Lord said unto him,"
44,9,12,""
44,9,13,"Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:"
44,9,14,"And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on your name."
44,9,15,"But the Lord said unto him,"
44,9,16,""
44,9,17,"And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
44,9,18,"And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight, and arose, and was baptized."
44,9,19,"And when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples who were at Damascus."
44,9,20,"And immediately he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God."
44,9,21,"But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them who called on this name in Jerusalem, and came here for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?"
44,9,22,"But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this one is the very Christ."
44,9,23,"And after many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:"
44,9,24,"But their plot was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him."
44,9,25,"Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall in a basket."
44,9,26,"And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple."
44,9,27,"But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus."
44,9,28,"And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem."
44,9,29,"And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Hellenists: but they went about to slay him."
44,9,30,"But when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus."
44,9,31,"Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied."
44,9,32,"And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints who dwelt at Lydda."
44,9,33,"And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been in bed eight years, and was paralyzed."
44,9,34,"And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you whole: arise, and make your bed. And he arose immediately."
44,9,35,"And all that dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the Lord."
44,9,36,"Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did."
44,9,37,"And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber."
44,9,38,"And since as Lydda was near to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them."
44,9,39,"Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them."
44,9,40,"But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up."
44,9,41,"And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive."
44,9,42,"And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord."
44,9,43,"And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner."
44,10,1,"There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,"
44,10,2,"A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always."
44,10,3,"He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius."
44,10,4,"And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Your prayers and your alms are come up for a memorial before God."
44,10,5,"And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:"
44,10,6,"He lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the seaside: he shall tell you what you ought to do."
44,10,7,"And when the angel who spoke unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;"
44,10,8,"And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa."
44,10,9,"On the next day, as they went on their journey, and drew near unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:"
44,10,10,"And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,"
44,10,11,"And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet held at the four corners, and let down to the earth:"
44,10,12,"In which were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air."
44,10,13,"And there came a voice to him,"
44,10,14,"But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean."
44,10,15,"And the voice spoke unto him again the second time,"
44,10,16,"This was done three times: and the vessel was received up again into heaven."
44,10,17,"Now while Peter wondered in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,"
44,10,18,"And called, and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was lodged there."
44,10,19,"While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,"
44,10,20,""
44,10,21,"Then Peter went down to the men who were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek: what is the cause for which you are come?"
44,10,22,"And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fears God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for you to come into his house, and to hear words from you."
44,10,23,"Then he called them in, and lodged them. And on the next day Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him."
44,10,24,"And the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends."
44,10,25,"And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshiped him."
44,10,26,"But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man."
44,10,27,"And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together."
44,10,28,"And he said unto them, You know that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean."
44,10,29,"Therefore I came unto you without questioning as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent you have sent for me?"
44,10,30,"And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,"
44,10,31,"And said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God."
44,10,32,"Send therefore to Joppa, and call here Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the seaside: who, when he comes, shall speak unto you."
44,10,33,"Immediately therefore I sent to you; and you have done well that you are come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded you of God."
44,10,34,"Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:"
44,10,35,"But in every nation he that fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted with him."
44,10,36,"The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)"
44,10,37,"That word, I say, you know, which was published throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;"
44,10,38,"How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him."
44,10,39,"And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:"
44,10,40,"Him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly;"
44,10,41,"Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead."
44,10,42,"And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he who was ordained of God to be the Judge of the living and dead."
44,10,43,"To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins."
44,10,44,"While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them who heard the word."
44,10,45,"And they of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit."
44,10,46,"For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,"
44,10,47,"Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?"
44,10,48,"And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to tarry certain days."
44,11,1,"And the apostles and brethren that were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God."
44,11,2,"And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,"
44,11,3,"Saying, You went in to men uncircumcised, and did eat with them."
44,11,4,"But Peter reviewed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it in order unto them, saying,"
44,11,5,"I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:"
44,11,6,"Upon which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw four-footed animals of the earth, and wild beasts, and reptiles, and fowls of the air."
44,11,7,"And I heard a voice saying unto me,"
44,11,8,"But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth."
44,11,9,"But the voice answered me again from heaven,"
44,11,10,"And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven."
44,11,11,"And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me."
44,11,12,"And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:"
44,11,13,"And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;"
44,11,14,"Who shall tell you words, by which you and all your house shall be saved."
44,11,15,"And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning."
44,11,16,"Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how he said,"
44,11,17,"If then God gave them the same gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; who was I, that I could withstand God?"
44,11,18,"When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life."
44,11,19,"Now they who were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only."
44,11,20,"And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spoke unto the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus."
44,11,21,"And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord."
44,11,22,"Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch."
44,11,23,"Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cling unto the Lord."
44,11,24,"For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and many people were added unto the Lord."
44,11,25,"Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, to seek Saul:"
44,11,26,"And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that for a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught many people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch."
44,11,27,"And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch."
44,11,28,"And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great famine throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar."
44,11,29,"Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren who dwelt in Judea:"
44,11,30,"Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul."
44,12,1,"Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to persecute certain of the church."
44,12,2,"And he killed James the brother of John with the sword."
44,12,3,"And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)"
44,12,4,"And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to keep him; intending after the passover to bring him forth to the people."
44,12,5,"Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him."
44,12,6,"And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the guards before the door kept the prison."
44,12,7,"And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he struck Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands."
44,12,8,"And the angel said unto him, Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals. And so he did. And he said unto him, Cast your garment about you, and follow me."
44,12,9,"And he went out, and followed him; and knew not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision."
44,12,10,"When they were past the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leads unto the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel departed from him."
44,12,11,"And when Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord has sent his angel, and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews."
44,12,12,"And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying."
44,12,13,"And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maid came to answer, named Rhoda."
44,12,14,"And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate."
44,12,15,"And they said unto her, You are mad. But she continued to affirm that it was so. Then they said, It is his angel."
44,12,16,"But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished."
44,12,17,"But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go show these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place."
44,12,18,"Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers over what had become of Peter."
44,12,19,"And when Herod had sought him, and found him not, he examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and there abode."
44,12,20,"And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was fed by the king's country."
44,12,21,"And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them."
44,12,22,"And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man."
44,12,23,"And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and died."
44,12,24,"But the word of God grew and multiplied."
44,12,25,"And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark."
44,13,1,"Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."
44,13,2,"As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said,"
44,13,3,"And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away."
44,13,4,"So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, departed unto Seleucia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus."
44,13,5,"And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as their helper."
44,13,6,"And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:"
44,13,7,"Who was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God."
44,13,8,"But Elymas the magician (for so is his name translated) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith."
44,13,9,"Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes on him,"
44,13,10,"And said, O full of all deceit and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?"
44,13,11,"And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand."
44,13,12,"Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord."
44,13,13,"Now when Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem."
44,13,14,"And when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down."
44,13,15,"And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, You men and brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on."
44,13,16,"Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you that fear God, listen."
44,13,17,"The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as sojourners in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he brought them out of it."
44,13,18,"And about the time of forty years he endured their manners in the wilderness."
44,13,19,"And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot."
44,13,20,"And after that he gave unto them judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet."
44,13,21,"And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years."
44,13,22,"And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said,"
44,13,23,"Of this man's descendants has God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Savior, Jesus:"
44,13,24,"When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel."
44,13,25,"And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think you that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there comes one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose."
44,13,26,"Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent."
44,13,27,"For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets who are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him."
44,13,28,"And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain."
44,13,29,"And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulcher."
44,13,30,"But God raised him from the dead:"
44,13,31,"And he was seen many days of them who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people."
44,13,32,"And we declare unto you glad tidings, how the promise which was made unto the fathers,"
44,13,33,"God has fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm,"
44,13,34,"And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said in this way,"
44,13,35,"Therefore he says also in another psalm,"
44,13,36,"For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption:"
44,13,37,"But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption."
44,13,38,"Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:"
44,13,39,"And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses."
44,13,40,"Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;"
44,13,41,""
44,13,42,"And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath."
44,13,43,"Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God."
44,13,44,"And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God."
44,13,45,"But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spoke against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming."
44,13,46,"Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles."
44,13,47,"For so has the Lord commanded us, saying,"
44,13,48,"And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed."
44,13,49,"And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region."
44,13,50,"But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their district."
44,13,51,"But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium."
44,13,52,"And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit."
44,14,1,"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed."
44,14,2,"But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds embittered against the brethren."
44,14,3,"A long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, who gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands."
44,14,4,"But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles."
44,14,5,"And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,"
44,14,6,"They were aware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lies round about:"
44,14,7,"And there they preached the gospel."
44,14,8,"And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:"
44,14,9,"The same heard Paul speak: who steadfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,"
44,14,10,"Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet. And he leaped and walked."
44,14,11,"And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men."
44,14,12,"And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker."
44,14,13,"Then the priest of Jupiter, being before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people."
44,14,14,"Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they tore their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,"
44,14,15,"And saying, Sirs, why do you these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities unto the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them:"
44,14,16,"Who in times past allowed all nations to walk in their own ways."
44,14,17,"Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
44,14,18,"And with these sayings scarcely restrained they the people, that they would not do sacrifice unto them."
44,14,19,"And there came there certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead."
44,14,20,"However, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe."
44,14,21,"And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,"
44,14,22,"Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."
44,14,23,"And when they had ordained elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed."
44,14,24,"And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia."
44,14,25,"And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:"
44,14,26,"And from there sailed to Antioch, from where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled."
44,14,27,"And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles."
44,14,28,"And there they abode a long time with the disciples."
44,15,1,"And certain men who came down from Judea taught the brethren, and said, Except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved."
44,15,2,"When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question."
44,15,3,"And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren."
44,15,4,"And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them."
44,15,5,"But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses."
44,15,6,"And the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter."
44,15,7,"And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe."
44,15,8,"And God, who knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did unto us;"
44,15,9,"And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith."
44,15,10,"Now therefore why test God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?"
44,15,11,"But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they."
44,15,12,"Then all the multitude kept silence, and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring what miracles and wonders God had done among the Gentiles by them."
44,15,13,"And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:"
44,15,14,"Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name."
44,15,15,"And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,"
44,15,16,""
44,15,17,""
44,15,18,"Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world."
44,15,19,"Therefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them, who from among the Gentiles are turned to God:"
44,15,20,"But that we write unto them, that they abstain from defilements of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood."
44,15,21,"For Moses of old time has in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day."
44,15,22,"Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:"
44,15,23,"And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greetings unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:"
44,15,24,"Since we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:"
44,15,25,"It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,"
44,15,26,"Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,15,27,"We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth."
44,15,28,"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;"
44,15,29,"That you abstain from anything offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Farewell."
44,15,30,"So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:"
44,15,31,"Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the exhortation."
44,15,32,"And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and strengthened them."
44,15,33,"And after they had tarried there awhile, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles."
44,15,34,"But it pleased Silas to abide there still."
44,15,35,"Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also."
44,15,36,"And some days later Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do."
44,15,37,"And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark."
44,15,38,"But Paul thought it not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work."
44,15,39,"And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;"
44,15,40,"And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being commended by the brethren unto the grace of God."
44,15,41,"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches."
44,16,1,"Then he came to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain woman, who was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:"
44,16,2,"Who was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium."
44,16,3,"Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places: for they all knew that his father was a Greek."
44,16,4,"And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem."
44,16,5,"And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily."
44,16,6,"Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia,"
44,16,7,"After they were come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit permitted them not."
44,16,8,"And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas."
44,16,9,"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, beseeching him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us."
44,16,10,"And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel unto them."
44,16,11,"Therefore setting sail from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;"
44,16,12,"And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days."
44,16,13,"And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a riverside, where prayer was accustomed to be made; and we sat down, and spoke unto the women who met there."
44,16,14,"And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, so that she attended unto the things which were spoken by Paul."
44,16,15,"And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she prevailed upon us."
44,16,16,"And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain maid possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:"
44,16,17,"The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who show unto us the way of salvation."
44,16,18,"And this did she many days. But Paul, being troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour."
44,16,19,"And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace unto the rulers,"
44,16,20,"And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,"
44,16,21,"And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans."
44,16,22,"And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates tore off their clothes, and commanded to beat them."
44,16,23,"And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely:"
44,16,24,"Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks."
44,16,25,"And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them."
44,16,26,"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed."
44,16,27,"And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled."
44,16,28,"But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm: for we are all here."
44,16,29,"Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,"
44,16,30,"And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44,16,31,"And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house."
44,16,32,"And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house."
44,16,33,"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately."
44,16,34,"And when he had brought them into his house, he sat food before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house."
44,16,35,"And when it was day, the magistrates sent the officers, saying, Let those men go."
44,16,36,"And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace."
44,16,37,"But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out secretly? nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out."
44,16,38,"And the officers told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans."
44,16,39,"And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city."
44,16,40,"And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed."
44,17,1,"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews:"
44,17,2,"And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,"
44,17,3,"Opening them up and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ."
44,17,4,"And some of them believed, and joined Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few."
44,17,5,"But the Jews who believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain wicked fellows of the rabble, and gathered a company, and set all the city in an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people."
44,17,6,"And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come here also;"
44,17,7,"Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus."
44,17,8,"And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things."
44,17,9,"And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go."
44,17,10,"And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming there went into the synagogue of the Jews."
44,17,11,"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so."
44,17,12,"Therefore many of them believed; also of honorable women who were Greeks, and of men, not a few."
44,17,13,"But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also, and stirred up the people."
44,17,14,"And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timothy abode there still."
44,17,15,"And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed."
44,17,16,"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry."
44,17,17,"Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him."
44,17,18,"Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? Others, He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection."
44,17,19,"And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof you speak, is?"
44,17,20,"For you bring certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean."
44,17,21,"(For all the Athenians and strangers who were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)"
44,17,22,"Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, You men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious."
44,17,23,"For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."
44,17,24,"God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands;"
44,17,25,"Neither is worshiped with men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things;"
44,17,26,"And has made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;"
44,17,27,"That they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:"
44,17,28,"For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring."
44,17,29,"Therefore then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Deity is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device."
44,17,30,"And the times of this ignorance God overlooked; but now commands all men everywhere to repent:"
44,17,31,"Because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; and of this he has given assurance unto all men, in that he has raised him from the dead."
44,17,32,"And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again of this matter."
44,17,33,"So Paul departed from among them."
44,17,34,"But certain men joined unto him, and believed: among whom was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them."
44,18,1,"After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;"
44,18,2,"And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them."
44,18,3,"And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers."
44,18,4,"And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks."
44,18,5,"And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the word, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ."
44,18,6,"And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his clothes, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles."
44,18,7,"And he departed from there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue."
44,18,8,"And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized."
44,18,9,"Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision,"
44,18,10,""
44,18,11,"And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."
44,18,12,"And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made an attack with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,"
44,18,13,"Saying, This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."
44,18,14,"And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked crime, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:"
44,18,15,"But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look you to it; for I will be no judge of such matters."
44,18,16,"And he drove them from the judgment seat."
44,18,17,"Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things."
44,18,18,"And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed from there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shaved his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow."
44,18,19,"And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews."
44,18,20,"When they desired him to tarry a longer time with them, he consented not;"
44,18,21,"But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God wills. And he sailed from Ephesus."
44,18,22,"And when he had landed at Caesarea, having gone up, and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch."
44,18,23,"And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples."
44,18,24,"And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus."
44,18,25,"This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John."
44,18,26,"And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly."
44,18,27,"And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much who had believed through grace:"
44,18,28,"For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ."
44,19,1,"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,"
44,19,2,"He said unto them, Received you the Holy Spirit when you believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Spirit."
44,19,3,"And he said unto them, Unto what then were you baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism."
44,19,4,"Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus."
44,19,5,"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,19,6,"And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied."
44,19,7,"And all the men were about twelve."
44,19,8,"And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, arguing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God."
44,19,9,"But when some were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, arguing daily in the school of one Tyrannus."
44,19,10,"And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks."
44,19,11,"And God did special miracles by the hands of Paul:"
44,19,12,"So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them."
44,19,13,"Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon themselves to call over them who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."
44,19,14,"And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, who did so."
44,19,15,"And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?"
44,19,16,"And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded."
44,19,17,"And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified."
44,19,18,"And many that believed came, and confessed, and told of their deeds."
44,19,19,"Many of them also who used magic arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver."
44,19,20,"So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed."
44,19,21,"After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
44,19,22,"So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a time."
44,19,23,"And the same time there arose no small stir about that way."
44,19,24,"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;"
44,19,25,"Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you know that by this craft we have our wealth."
44,19,26,"Moreover you see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, which are made with hands:"
44,19,27,"So that not only this our craft is in danger to be discredited; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship."
44,19,28,"And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
44,19,29,"And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theater."
44,19,30,"And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples allowed him not."
44,19,31,"And certain of the chief of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, begging him that he would not venture into the theater."
44,19,32,"Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the majority knew not why they were come together."
44,19,33,"And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense unto the people."
44,19,34,"But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians."
44,19,35,"And when the town clerk had quieted the people, he said, You men of Ephesus, what man is there that knows not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?"
44,19,36,"Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly."
44,19,37,"For you have brought here these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess."
44,19,38,"Therefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen who are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them charge one another."
44,19,39,"But if you inquire anything concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly."
44,19,40,"For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause for which we may give an account of this commotion."
44,19,41,"And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly."
44,20,1,"And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed to go into Macedonia."
44,20,2,"And when he had gone through those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,"
44,20,3,"And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia."
44,20,4,"And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus."
44,20,5,"These going before tarried for us at Troas."
44,20,6,"And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them at Troas in five days; where we abode seven days."
44,20,7,"And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the next day; and continued his speech until midnight."
44,20,8,"And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together."
44,20,9,"And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead."
44,20,10,"And Paul went down, and fell upon him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him."
44,20,11,"When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed."
44,20,12,"And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted."
44,20,13,"And we went ahead to the ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take aboard Paul: for so had he appointed, intending himself to go on foot."
44,20,14,"And when he met with us at Assos, we took him aboard, and came to Mitylene."
44,20,15,"And we sailed from there, and came the next day opposite Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus."
44,20,16,"For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hastened, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost."
44,20,17,"And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church."
44,20,18,"And when they were come to him, he said unto them, You know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all times,"
44,20,19,"Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:"
44,20,20,"And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,"
44,20,21,"Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."
44,20,22,"And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:"
44,20,23,"Except that the Holy Spirit witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me."
44,20,24,"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God."
44,20,25,"And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more."
44,20,26,"Therefore I testify to you this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men."
44,20,27,"For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God."
44,20,28,"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood."
44,20,29,"For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock."
44,20,30,"Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them."
44,20,31,"Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone night and day with tears."
44,20,32,"And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them who are sanctified."
44,20,33,"I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel."
44,20,34,"Yea, you yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me."
44,20,35,"I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said,"
44,20,36,"And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all."
44,20,37,"And they all wept much, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,"
44,20,38,"Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship."
44,21,1,"And it came to pass, that after we were parted from them, and had set sail, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from there unto Patara:"
44,21,2,"And finding a ship sailing over unto Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set forth."
44,21,3,"Now when we had sighted Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unload her cargo."
44,21,4,"And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,5,"And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed."
44,21,6,"And when we had taken our leave one of another, we boarded ship; and they returned home again."
44,21,7,"And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and greeted the brethren, and abode with them one day."
44,21,8,"And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven; and abode with him."
44,21,9,"And the same man had four daughters, virgins, who did prophesy."
44,21,10,"And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judea a certain prophet, named Agabus."
44,21,11,"And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's belt, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit,"
44,21,12,"And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, begged him not to go up to Jerusalem."
44,21,13,"Then Paul answered, What mean you to weep and to break my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44,21,14,"And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done."
44,21,15,"And after those days we made ready, and went up to Jerusalem."
44,21,16,"There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge."
44,21,17,"And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly."
44,21,18,"And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present."
44,21,19,"And when he had greeted them, he declared particularly what things God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry."
44,21,20,"And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who believe; and they are all zealous of the law:"
44,21,21,"And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs."
44,21,22,"What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that you are come."
44,21,23,"Do therefore this that we say to you: We have four men who have a vow on themselves;"
44,21,24,"Them take, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, of which they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law."
44,21,25,"And concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, except only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication."
44,21,26,"Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to announce the accomplishment of the days of purification, until an offering should be offered for every one of them."
44,21,27,"And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews who were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,"
44,21,28,"Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and has polluted this holy place."
44,21,29,"(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)"
44,21,30,"And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and immediately the doors were shut."
44,21,31,"And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar."
44,21,32,"Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul."
44,21,33,"Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done."
44,21,34,"And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the barracks."
44,21,35,"And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers because of the violence of the people."
44,21,36,"For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him."
44,21,37,"And as Paul was to be led into the barracks, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto you? Who said, Can you speak Greek?"
44,21,38,"Are not you that Egyptian, who before these days made an uproar, and led out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?"
44,21,39,"But Paul said, I am a man who is a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech you, allow me to speak unto the people."
44,21,40,"And when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spoke unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,"
44,22,1,"Men, brethren, and fathers, hear you my defense which I make now unto you."
44,22,2,"(And when they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he said,)"
44,22,3,"I am verily a man who is a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day."
44,22,4,"And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women."
44,22,5,"As also the high priest does bear me witness, and all the council of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them who were there bound unto Jerusalem, to be punished."
44,22,6,"And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come near unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me."
44,22,7,"And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,"
44,22,8,"And I answered, Who are you, Lord? And he said unto me,"
44,22,9,"And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spoke to me."
44,22,10,"And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me,"
44,22,11,"And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus."
44,22,12,"And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews who dwelt there,"
44,22,13,"Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him."
44,22,14,"And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of his mouth."
44,22,15,"For you shall be his witness unto all men of what you have seen and heard."
44,22,16,"And now why do you tarry? arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord."
44,22,17,"And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;"
44,22,18,"And saw him saying unto me,"
44,22,19,"And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on you:"
44,22,20,"And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the clothing of them that slew him."
44,22,21,"And he said unto me,"
44,22,22,"And they gave him audience until this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live."
44,22,23,"And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,"
44,22,24,"The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the barracks, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know why they cried so against him."
44,22,25,"And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?"
44,22,26,"When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what you do: for this man is a Roman."
44,22,27,"Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, are you a Roman? He said, Yes."
44,22,28,"And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born."
44,22,29,"Then immediately they departed from him who should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him."
44,22,30,"On the next day, because he would have known the certainty of why he was accused of the Jews, he released him, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them."
44,23,1,"And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day."
44,23,2,"And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth."
44,23,3,"Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite you, you whitewashed wall: for do you sit to judge me after the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?"
44,23,4,"And they that stood by said, Do you revile God's high priest?"
44,23,5,"Then said Paul, I knew not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written,"
44,23,6,"But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question."
44,23,7,"And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided."
44,23,8,"For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both."
44,23,9,"And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' party arose, and contended, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God."
44,23,10,"And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the barracks."
44,23,11,"And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said,"
44,23,12,"And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul."
44,23,13,"And they were more than forty who had made this conspiracy."
44,23,14,"And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul."
44,23,15,"Now therefore you with the council inform the chief captain that he bring him down unto you tomorrow, as though you would inquire something more exactly concerning him: and we, before he comes near, are ready to kill him."
44,23,16,"And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the barracks, and told Paul."
44,23,17,"Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he has a certain thing to tell him."
44,23,18,"So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to bring this young man unto you, who has something to say unto you."
44,23,19,"Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is it that you have to tell me?"
44,23,20,"And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you that you would bring down Paul tomorrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more exactly."
44,23,21,"But do not yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from you."
44,23,22,"So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See that you tell no man that you have showed these things to me."
44,23,23,"And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen seventy, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;"
44,23,24,"And provide them mounts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor."
44,23,25,"And he wrote a letter after this manner:"
44,23,26,"Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sends greeting."
44,23,27,"This man was taken of the Jews, and would have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman."
44,23,28,"And when I would have known the cause for which they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:"
44,23,29,"Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds."
44,23,30,"And when it was told me that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent immediately to you, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before you what they had against him. Farewell."
44,23,31,"Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris."
44,23,32,"The next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the barracks:"
44,23,33,"When they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, they presented Paul also before him."
44,23,34,"And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia he said,"
44,23,35,"I will hear you when your accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall."
44,24,1,"And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul."
44,24,2,"And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by you we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by your provision,"
44,24,3,"We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness."
44,24,4,"Nevertheless, that I be not further tedious unto you, I pray you that you would hear us in your kindness a few words."
44,24,5,"For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:"
44,24,6,"Who also has gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law."
44,24,7,"But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,"
44,24,8,"Commanding his accusers to come unto you: by examining of whom you yourself may take knowledge of all these things, of which we accuse him."
44,24,9,"And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so."
44,24,10,"Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Since I know that you have been for many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:"
44,24,11,"Because you may understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship."
44,24,12,"And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:"
44,24,13,"Neither can they prove the things of which they now accuse me."
44,24,14,"But this I confess unto you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:"
44,24,15,"And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."
44,24,16,"And in this do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offense toward God, and toward men."
44,24,17,"Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings."
44,24,18,"Then certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult."
44,24,19,"Who ought to have been here before you, and object, if they had anything against me."
44,24,20,"Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,"
44,24,21,"Except it be for this one thing, that I cried standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day."
44,24,22,"And when Felix heard these things, having more complete knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the rest of your matter."
44,24,23,"And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintances to minister or come unto him."
44,24,24,"And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ."
44,24,25,"And as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I have a convenient time, I will call for you."
44,24,26,"He hoped also that money should have been given him by Paul, that he might release him: therefore he sent for him often, and conferred with him."
44,24,27,"But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' position: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a favor, left Paul bound."
44,25,1,"Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem."
44,25,2,"Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and urged him,"
44,25,3,"And desired a favor from him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, plotting to kill him along the way."
44,25,4,"But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart there shortly."
44,25,5,"Let them therefore, said he, who among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him."
44,25,6,"And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought."
44,25,7,"And when he was come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many serious complaints against Paul, which they could not prove."
44,25,8,"While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended anything at all."
44,25,9,"But Festus, willing to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul, and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?"
44,25,10,"Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as you very well know."
44,25,11,"For if I be an offender, or have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things of which these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar."
44,25,12,"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Have you appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shall you go."
44,25,13,"And after some days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to greet Festus."
44,25,14,"And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:"
44,25,15,"About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him."
44,25,16,"To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and have opportunity to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him."
44,25,17,"Therefore, when they were come here, without any delay the next day I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth."
44,25,18,"Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed:"
44,25,19,"But had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive."
44,25,20,"And because I was perplexed concerning such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters."
44,25,21,"But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar."
44,25,22,"Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. Tomorrow, said he, you shall hear him."
44,25,23,"And the next day, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth."
44,25,24,"And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have petitioned me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer."
44,25,25,"But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him."
44,25,26,"Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination, I might have somewhat to write."
44,25,27,"For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to specify the crimes laid against him."
44,26,1,"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and answered for himself:"
44,26,2,"I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before you concerning all the things of which I am accused of the Jews:"
44,26,3,"Especially because I know you to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: therefore I beseech you to hear me patiently."
44,26,4,"My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;"
44,26,5,"Who knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most strict sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee."
44,26,6,"And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:"
44,26,7,"Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews."
44,26,8,"Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?"
44,26,9,"I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth."
44,26,10,"Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them."
44,26,11,"And I punished them often in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities."
44,26,12,"Thus as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,"
44,26,13,"At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them who journeyed with me."
44,26,14,"And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue,"
44,26,15,"And I said, Who are you, Lord? And he said,"
44,26,16,""
44,26,17,""
44,26,18,""
44,26,19,"Therefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:"
44,26,20,"But showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works befitting repentance."
44,26,21,"For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me."
44,26,22,"Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:"
44,26,23,"That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should proclaim light unto the people, and to the Gentiles."
44,26,24,"And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning does make you mad."
44,26,25,"But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and good sense."
44,26,26,"For the king knows of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner."
44,26,27,"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."
44,26,28,"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost you persuade me to be a Christian."
44,26,29,"And Paul said, I would to God, that not only you, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds."
44,26,30,"And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:"
44,26,31,"And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
44,26,32,"Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar."
44,27,1,"And when it was determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band."
44,27,2,"And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we embarked, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us."
44,27,3,"And the next day we put in at Sidon. And Julius courteously treated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself."
44,27,4,"And when we had put to sea from there, we sailed close to Cyprus, because the winds were contrary."
44,27,5,"And when we had sailed over the sea near Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia."
44,27,6,"And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy; and he put us on it."
44,27,7,"And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were hardly come off Cnidus, the wind not allowing us, we sailed close to Crete, off Salmone;"
44,27,8,"And, with difficulty passing it, came unto a place which is called The Fair Havens; near to which was the city of Lasea."
44,27,9,"Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,"
44,27,10,"And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the cargo and ship, but also of our lives."
44,27,11,"Nevertheless the centurion believed the captain and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul."
44,27,12,"And because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to depart from there also, if by any means they might arrive at Phoenix, and there to winter; which is a haven of Crete, and opens toward the southwest and northwest."
44,27,13,"And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, raising anchor, they sailed close by Crete."
44,27,14,"But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon."
44,27,15,"And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her be driven."
44,27,16,"And running under a certain island which is called Cauda, we had much work to secure the boat:"
44,27,17,"Which when they had hoisted it, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksand, struck sail, and so were driven."
44,27,18,"And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;"
44,27,19,"And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship."
44,27,20,"And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away."
44,27,21,"But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, you should have hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss."
44,27,22,"And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship."
44,27,23,"For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,"
44,27,24,"Saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God has given you all them that sail with you."
44,27,25,"Therefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me."
44,27,26,"However we must be cast upon a certain island."
44,27,27,"But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the sailors deemed that they drew near to some country;"
44,27,28,"And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms."
44,27,29,"Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day."
44,27,30,"And as the sailors were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under pretense as though they would have cast anchors out of the bow,"
44,27,31,"Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, you cannot be saved."
44,27,32,"Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off."
44,27,33,"And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing."
44,27,34,"Therefore I pray you to take some food: for this is for your health: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you."
44,27,35,"And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat."
44,27,36,"Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some food."
44,27,37,"And we were in all in the ship two hundred and seventy-six souls."
44,27,38,"And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea."
44,27,39,"And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain bay with a shore, into which they were minded, if it were possible, to drive in the ship."
44,27,40,"And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and released the rudder bands, and hoisted up the foresail to the wind, and made toward shore."
44,27,41,"And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the bow stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but the stern was broken with the violence of the waves."
44,27,42,"And the soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape."
44,27,43,"But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:"
44,27,44,"And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land."
44,28,1,"And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Malta."
44,28,2,"And the native people showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold."
44,28,3,"And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand."
44,28,4,"And when the natives saw the creature hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice allows not to live."
44,28,5,"And he shook off the creature into the fire, and felt no harm."
44,28,6,"However they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god."
44,28,7,"In the same place were lands of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously."
44,28,8,"And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of dysentery: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him."
44,28,9,"So when this was done, others also, who had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:"
44,28,10,"Who also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they put on board such things as were necessary."
44,28,11,"And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux."
44,28,12,"And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days."
44,28,13,"And from there we set a course, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:"
44,28,14,"Where we found brethren, and were invited to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome."
44,28,15,"And from there, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as the Appii Forum, and The Three Taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage."
44,28,16,"And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was allowed to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him."
44,28,17,"And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
44,28,18,"Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me."
44,28,19,"But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had anything to accuse my nation of."
44,28,20,"For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."
44,28,21,"And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judea concerning you, neither any of the brethren that came showed or spoke any harm of you."
44,28,22,"But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against."
44,28,23,"And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified of the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening."
44,28,24,"And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not."
44,28,25,"And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after Paul had spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Spirit by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,"
44,28,26,"Saying,"

44,28,28,"Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it."
44,28,29,"And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had much dispute among themselves."
44,28,30,"And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,"
44,28,31,"Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him."
45,1,1,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,"
45,1,2,"(Which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)"
45,1,3,"Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made of the descendants of David according to the flesh;"
45,1,4,"And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:"
45,1,5,"By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:"
45,1,6,"Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:"
45,1,7,"To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
45,1,8,"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world."
45,1,9,"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;"
45,1,10,"Making request, if by any means now at last I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you."
45,1,11,"For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;"
45,1,12,"That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me."
45,1,13,"Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that often I purposed to come unto you, (but was prevented thus far,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles."
45,1,14,"I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise."
45,1,15,"So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also."
45,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."
45,1,17,"For in it is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith."
45,1,18,"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;"
45,1,19,"Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it unto them."
45,1,20,"For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and deity; so that they are without excuse:"
45,1,21,"Because, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts were darkened."
45,1,22,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,"
45,1,23,"And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things."
45,1,24,"Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:"
45,1,25,"Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen."
45,1,26,"For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:"
45,1,27,"And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is shameful, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was fitting."
45,1,28,"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not proper;"
45,1,29,"Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,"
45,1,30,"Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
45,1,31,"Without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:"
45,1,32,"Who knowing the judgment of God, that they who commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."
45,2,1,"Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whosoever you are that judge: for in what you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you that judge do the same things."
45,2,2,"But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them who commit such things."
45,2,3,"And do you think, O man, that judge them who do such things, and do the same, that you shall escape the judgment of God?"
45,2,4,"Or despise you the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?"
45,2,5,"But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart treasure up unto yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;"
45,2,6,"Who will render to every man according to his deeds:"
45,2,7,"To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:"
45,2,8,"But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,"
45,2,9,"Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;"
45,2,10,"But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:"
45,2,11,"For there is no respect of persons with God."
45,2,12,"For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;"
45,2,13,"(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified."
45,2,14,"For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:"
45,2,15,"Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)"
45,2,16,"In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel."
45,2,17,"Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,"
45,2,18,"And know his will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;"
45,2,19,"And are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of them who are in darkness,"
45,2,20,"An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who has the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law."
45,2,21,"You therefore who teach another, can you not teach yourself? you that preach a man should not steal, do you steal?"
45,2,22,"You that say a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? you that abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?"
45,2,23,"You that make your boast of the law, through breaking the law do you dishonor God?"
45,2,24,""
45,2,25,"For circumcision verily profits, if you keep the law: but if you are a breaker of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision."
45,2,26,"Therefore if the uncircumcision keeps the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?"
45,2,27,"And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?"
45,2,28,"For he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:"
45,2,29,"But he is a Jew, who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God."
45,3,1,"What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?"
45,3,2,"Much every way: chiefly, because unto them were committed the oracles of God."
45,3,3,"For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faithfulness of God without effect?"
45,3,4,"God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged."
45,3,5,"But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)"
45,3,6,"God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?"
45,3,7,"For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?"
45,3,8,"And not rather, (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just."
45,3,9,"What then? are we better than they? No, in no way: for we have before proved both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;"
45,3,10,"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"
45,3,11,"There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God."
45,3,12,"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one."
45,3,13,"Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:"
45,3,14,"Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:"
45,3,15,"Their feet are swift to shed blood:"
45,3,16,"Destruction and misery are in their ways:"
45,3,17,"And the way of peace have they not known:"
45,3,18,"There is no fear of God before their eyes."
45,3,19,"Now we know that whatsoever things the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God."
45,3,20,"Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin."
45,3,21,"But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;"
45,3,22,"Even the righteousness of God which is by faith in Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:"
45,3,23,"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"
45,3,24,"Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:"
45,3,25,"Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;"
45,3,26,"To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus."
45,3,27,"Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith."
45,3,28,"Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law."
45,3,29,"Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:"
45,3,30,"Seeing it is one God, who shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith."
45,3,31,"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."
45,4,1,"What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?"
45,4,2,"For if Abraham were justified by works, he has something in which to boast; but not before God."
45,4,3,"For what says the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness."
45,4,4,"Now to him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt."
45,4,5,"But to him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."
45,4,6,"Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputes righteousness without works,"
45,4,7,"Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered."
45,4,8,"Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin."
45,4,9,"Comes this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness."
45,4,10,"How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision."
45,4,11,"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:"
45,4,12,"And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised."
45,4,13,"For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his descendants, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."
45,4,14,"For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:"
45,4,15,"Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression."
45,4,16,"Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the descendants; not to those only who are of the law, but to those also who are of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,"
45,4,17,"(As it is written,"
45,4,18,"Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken,"
45,4,19,"And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body as now dead, when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:"
45,4,20,"He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;"
45,4,21,"And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform."
45,4,22,"And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness."
45,4,23,"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;"
45,4,24,"But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;"
45,4,25,"Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification."
45,5,1,"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:"
45,5,2,"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
45,5,3,"And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience;"
45,5,4,"And patience, experience; and experience, hope:"
45,5,5,"And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given unto us."
45,5,6,"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly."
45,5,7,"For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die."
45,5,8,"But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
45,5,9,"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."
45,5,10,"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life."
45,5,11,"And not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation."
45,5,12,"Therefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:"
45,5,13,"(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law."
45,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come."
45,5,15,"So also is the free gift not like the offense. For if through the offense of one many are dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded unto many."
45,5,16,"So is the gift not like it was by one that sinned: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification."
45,5,17,"For if by one man's offense death reigned by one; much more they who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)"
45,5,18,"Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life."
45,5,19,"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."
45,5,20,"Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:"
45,5,21,"That as sin has reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
45,6,2,"God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer in it?"
45,6,3,"Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?"
45,6,4,"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that just as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
45,6,5,"For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:"
45,6,6,"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we should no longer serve sin."
45,6,7,"For he that is dead is freed from sin."
45,6,8,"Now if we are dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:"
45,6,9,"Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him."
45,6,10,"For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he lives, he lives unto God."
45,6,11,"Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,6,12,"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts."
45,6,13,"Neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God."
45,6,14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace."
45,6,15,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."
45,6,16,"Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?"
45,6,17,"But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you."
45,6,18,"Being then made free from sin, you became the servants of righteousness."
45,6,19,"I speak after the manner of men because of the weakness of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness."
45,6,20,"For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness."
45,6,21,"What fruit had you then in those things of which you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death."
45,6,22,"But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life."
45,6,23,"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
45,7,1,"Know you not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?"
45,7,2,"For the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives; but if the husband dies, she is loosed from the law of her husband."
45,7,3,"So then if, while her husband lives, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband dies, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she is married to another man."
45,7,4,"Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God."
45,7,5,"For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death."
45,7,6,"But now we are delivered from the law, being dead to that in which we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter."
45,7,7,"What shall we say then? is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, you shall not covet."
45,7,8,"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all manner of covetousness. For without the law sin was dead."
45,7,9,"For I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."
45,7,10,"And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death."
45,7,11,"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me."
45,7,12,"Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."
45,7,13,"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly sinful."
45,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."
45,7,15,"For that which I do I know not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I."
45,7,16,"If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good."
45,7,17,"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me."
45,7,18,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not."
45,7,19,"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do."
45,7,20,"Now if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me."
45,7,21,"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me."
45,7,22,"For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:"
45,7,23,"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
45,7,24,"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
45,7,25,"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin."
45,8,1,"There is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
45,8,2,"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death."
45,8,3,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:"
45,8,4,"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
45,8,5,"For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit."
45,8,6,"For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."
45,8,7,"Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
45,8,8,"So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God."
45,8,9,"But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."
45,8,10,"And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness."
45,8,11,"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also bring to life your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you."
45,8,12,"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh."
45,8,13,"For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do put to death the deeds of the body, you shall live."
45,8,14,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
45,8,15,"For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father."
45,8,16,"The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:"
45,8,17,"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, so that we may be also glorified together."
45,8,18,"For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us."
45,8,19,"For the earnest expectation of the creation waits for the manifestation of the sons of God."
45,8,20,"For the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,"
45,8,21,"Because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God."
45,8,22,"For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now."
45,8,23,"And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, that is, the redemption of our body."
45,8,24,"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?"
45,8,25,"But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it."
45,8,26,"Likewise the Spirit also helps our weakness: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
45,8,27,"And he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God."
45,8,28,"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."
45,8,29,"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren."
45,8,30,"Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
45,8,31,"What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?"
45,8,32,"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
45,8,33,"Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies."
45,8,34,"Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us."
45,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
45,8,36,"As it is written, For your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter."
45,8,37,"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."
45,8,38,"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,"
45,8,39,"Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creation, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
45,9,1,"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit,"
45,9,2,"That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart."
45,9,3,"For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:"
45,9,4,"Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;"
45,9,5,"Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen."
45,9,6,"Not as though the word of God has taken no effect. For they are not all Israel, who are of Israel:"
45,9,7,"Neither, because they are the descendants of Abraham, are they all children: but,"
45,9,8,"That is, They who are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the descendants."
45,9,9,"For this is the word of promise,"
45,9,10,"And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;"
45,9,11,"(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calls;)"
45,9,12,"It was said unto her,"
45,9,13,"As it is written,"
45,9,14,"What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid."
45,9,15,"For he says to Moses,"
45,9,16,"So then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy."
45,9,17,"For the scripture says unto Pharaoh,"
45,9,18,"Therefore has he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens."
45,9,19,"You will say then unto me, Why does he yet find fault? For who has resisted his will?"
45,9,20,"Nay but, O man, who are you that replies against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why have you made me thus?"
45,9,21,"Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?"
45,9,22,"What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:"
45,9,23,"And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared unto glory,"
45,9,24,"Even us, whom he has called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?"
45,9,25,"As he says also in Hosea,"
45,9,26,"And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them,"
45,9,27,"Isaiah also cries concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:"
45,9,28,"For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth."
45,9,29,"And as Isaiah said before, Except the Lord of hosts had left us a descendant, we had been as Sodom, and been made like unto Gomorrah."
45,9,30,"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith."
45,9,31,"But Israel, who followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness."
45,9,32,"Why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling stone;"
45,9,33,"As it is written,"
45,10,1,"Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved."
45,10,2,"For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge."
45,10,3,"For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."
45,10,4,"For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believes."
45,10,5,"For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law,"
45,10,6,"But the righteousness which is of faith speaks thus, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)"
45,10,7,"Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)"
45,10,8,"But what says it? The word is near you, even in your mouth, and in your heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;"
45,10,9,"That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved."
45,10,10,"For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
45,10,11,"For the scripture says,"
45,10,12,"For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him."
45,10,13,""
45,10,14,"How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?"
45,10,15,"And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!"
45,10,16,"But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?"
45,10,17,"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."
45,10,18,"But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world."
45,10,19,"But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says,"
45,10,20,"But Isaiah is very bold, and says,"
45,10,21,"But to Israel he says,"
45,11,1,"I say then, Has God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the descendants of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."
45,11,2,"God has not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah? how he makes intercession to God against Israel, saying,"
45,11,3,"Lord, they have killed your prophets, and dug down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."
45,11,4,"But what says the answer of God unto him?"
45,11,5,"Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace."
45,11,6,"And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work."
45,11,7,"What then? Israel has not obtained that which it seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded"
45,11,8,"(According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day."
45,11,9,"And David says, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompense unto them:"
45,11,10,"Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and bow down their back always."
45,11,11,"I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy."
45,11,12,"Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?"
45,11,13,"For I speak to you Gentiles, since I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:"
45,11,14,"If by any means I may provoke to envy them who are my flesh, and might save some of them."
45,11,15,"For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?"
45,11,16,"For if the firstfruit are holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root is holy, so are the branches."
45,11,17,"And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;"
45,11,18,"Boast not against the branches. But if you boast, you bear not the root, but the root you."
45,11,19,"You will say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in."
45,11,20,"Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Be not arrogant, but fear:"
45,11,21,"For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also not spare you."
45,11,22,"Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise you also shall be cut off."
45,11,23,"And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again."
45,11,24,"For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?"
45,11,25,"For I would not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in."
45,11,26,"And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written,"
45,11,27,""
45,11,28,"As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes."
45,11,29,"For the gifts and calling of God are unchangeable."
45,11,30,"For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:"
45,11,31,"Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy."
45,11,32,"For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all."
45,11,33,"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!"
45,11,34,"For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been his counselor?"
45,11,35,"Or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?"
45,11,36,"For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory forever. Amen."
45,12,1,"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service."
45,12,2,"And be not conformed to this world: but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."
45,12,3,"For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith."
45,12,4,"For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:"
45,12,5,"So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another."
45,12,6,"Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;"
45,12,7,"Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teaches, on teaching;"
45,12,8,"Or he that exhorts, on exhortation: he that gives, let him do it in simplicity; he that rules, with diligence; he that shows mercy, with cheerfulness."
45,12,9,"Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good."
45,12,10,"Be tender loving one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another;"
45,12,11,"Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;"
45,12,12,"Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; constant in prayer;"
45,12,13,"Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality."
45,12,14,"Bless them who persecute you: bless, and curse not."
45,12,15,"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."
45,12,16,"Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits."
45,12,17,"Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men."
45,12,18,"If it be possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men."
45,12,19,"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written,"
45,12,20,"Therefore if your enemy hungers, feed him; if he thirsts, give him drink: for in so doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head."
45,12,21,"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."
45,13,1,"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."
45,13,2,"Whosoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves judgment."
45,13,3,"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Will you then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same:"
45,13,4,"For he is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil."
45,13,5,"Therefore you must be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscienceâ€™s sake."
45,13,6,"For, for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing."
45,13,7,"Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor."
45,13,8,"Owe no man anything, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law."
45,13,9,"For this,"
45,13,10,"Love works no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."
45,13,11,"And this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed."
45,13,12,"The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light."
45,13,13,"Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and wantonness, not in strife and envying."
45,13,14,"But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof."
45,14,1,"Receive him that is weak in the faith, but not for passing judgment."
45,14,2,"For one believes that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eats herbs."
45,14,3,"Let not him that eats despise him that eats not; and let not him who eats not judge him that eats: for God has received him."
45,14,4,"Who are you that judge another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls. Yea, he shall be held up: for God is able to make him stand."
45,14,5,"One man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind."
45,14,6,"He that regards the day, regards it unto the Lord; and he that regards not the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He that eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that eats not, to the Lord he eats not, and gives God thanks."
45,14,7,"For none of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself."
45,14,8,"For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's."
45,14,9,"For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living."
45,14,10,"But why do you judge your brother? or why do you despise your brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ."
45,14,11,"For it is written,"
45,14,12,"So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God."
45,14,13,"Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way."
45,14,14,"I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteems anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean."
45,14,15,"But if your brother is grieved with your food, you no longer walk in love. Destroy not him with your food, for whom Christ died."
45,14,16,"Let not then your good be evil spoken of:"
45,14,17,"For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit."
45,14,18,"For he that in these things serves Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men."
45,14,19,"Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things with which one may edify another."
45,14,20,"For food destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eats with offense."
45,14,21,"It is good neither to eat meat, nor to drink wine, nor anything by which your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak."
45,14,22,"Have you faith? have it to yourself before God. Happy is he that condemns not himself in that thing which he allows."
45,14,23,"And he that doubts is condemned if he eats, because he eats not of faith: for whatever is not of faith is sin."
45,15,1,"We then that are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves."
45,15,2,"Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification."
45,15,3,"For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written,"
45,15,4,"For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope."
45,15,5,"Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:"
45,15,6,"That you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
45,15,7,"Therefore receive one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God."
45,15,8,"Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:"
45,15,9,"And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to you among the Gentiles, and sing unto your name."
45,15,10,"And again he says, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people."
45,15,11,"And again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; and laud him, all you people."
45,15,12,"And again, Isaiah says, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust."
45,15,13,"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit."
45,15,14,"And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another."
45,15,15,"Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some way, as reminding you, because of the grace that is given to me of God,"
45,15,16,"That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
45,15,17,"I have therefore that of which I may boast through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God."
45,15,18,"For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not worked by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,"
45,15,19,"Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ."
45,15,20,"Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:"
45,15,21,"But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand."
45,15,22,"For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you."
45,15,23,"But now having no more place of work in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;"
45,15,24,"Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way there by you, if first I am somewhat refreshed with your company."
45,15,25,"But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints."
45,15,26,"For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints who are at Jerusalem."
45,15,27,"It has pleased them greatly; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in material things."
45,15,28,"When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you to Spain."
45,15,29,"And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ."
45,15,30,"Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;"
45,15,31,"That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;"
45,15,32,"That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed."
45,15,33,"Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen."
45,16,1,"I commend unto you Phebe our sister, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:"
45,16,2,"That you receive her in the Lord, as becomes saints, and that you assist her in whatever business she has need of you: for she has been a helper of many, and of myself also."
45,16,3,"Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:"
45,16,4,"Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles."
45,16,5,"Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Greet my well beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ."
45,16,6,"Greet Mary, who bestowed much labor on us."
45,16,7,"Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me."
45,16,8,"Greet Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord."
45,16,9,"Greet Urbanus our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved."
45,16,10,"Greet Apelles approved in Christ. Greet them who are of Aristobulus' household."
45,16,11,"Greet Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that are of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord."
45,16,12,"Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet the beloved Persis, who labored much in the Lord."
45,16,13,"Greet Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine."
45,16,14,"Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren who are with them."
45,16,15,"Greet Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them."
45,16,16,"Greet one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you."
45,16,17,"Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them who cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; and avoid them."
45,16,18,"For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the innocent."
45,16,19,"For your obedience is well known unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and innocent concerning evil."
45,16,20,"And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen."
45,16,21,"Timothy my fellow worker, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, greet you."
45,16,22,"I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, greet you in the Lord."
45,16,23,"Gaius my host, and of the whole church, greets you. Erastus the treasurer of the city greets you, and Quartus a brother."
45,16,24,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen."
45,16,25,"Now to him who is able to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,"
45,16,26,"But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:"
45,16,27,"To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen."
46,1,1,"Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,"
46,1,2,"Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:"
46,1,3,"Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
46,1,4,"I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;"
46,1,5,"That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;"
46,1,6,"Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:"
46,1,7,"So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
46,1,8,"Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
46,1,9,"God is faithful, by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord."
46,1,10,"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment."
46,1,11,"For it has been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them who are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you."
46,1,12,"Now this I say, that every one of you says, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ."
46,1,13,"Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?"
46,1,14,"I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;"
46,1,15,"Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name."
46,1,16,"And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other."
46,1,17,"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect."
46,1,18,"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of God."
46,1,19,"For it is written,"
46,1,20,"Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?"
46,1,21,"For since in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
46,1,22,"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:"
46,1,23,"But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness;"
46,1,24,"But unto them who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
46,1,25,"Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
46,1,26,"For you see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:"
46,1,27,"But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;"
46,1,28,"And base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are:"
46,1,29,"That no flesh should glory in his presence."
46,1,30,"And of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:"
46,1,31,"That, according as it is written,"
46,2,1,"And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God."
46,2,2,"For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
46,2,3,"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."
46,2,4,"And my speech and my preaching were not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:"
46,2,5,"That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
46,2,6,"But we speak wisdom among them that are mature: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:"
46,2,7,"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:"
46,2,8,"Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
46,2,9,"But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him."
46,2,10,"But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God."
46,2,11,"For what man knows the things of a man, except the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God."
46,2,12,"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God."
46,2,13,"Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches; comparing spiritual things with spiritual."
46,2,14,"But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned."
46,2,15,"But he that is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged of no man."
46,2,16,"For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."
46,3,1,"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ."
46,3,2,"I have fed you with milk, and not with solid food: for until now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able."
46,3,3,"For you are yet carnal: for while there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?"
46,3,4,"For while one says, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are you not carnal?"
46,3,5,"Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?"
46,3,6,"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase."
46,3,7,"So then neither is he that plants anything, neither he that waters; but God that gives the increase."
46,3,8,"Now he that plants and he that waters are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor."
46,3,9,"For we are laborers together with God: you are God's field, you are God's building."
46,3,10,"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon."
46,3,11,"For no other foundation can a man lay than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
46,3,12,"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;"
46,3,13,"Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall test every man's work of what sort it is."
46,3,14,"If any man's work abide which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward."
46,3,15,"If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire."
46,3,16,"Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?"
46,3,17,"If any man defiles the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are."
46,3,18,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
46,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness."
46,3,20,"And again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
46,3,21,"Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;"
46,3,22,"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;"
46,3,23,"And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's."
46,4,1,"Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God."
46,4,2,"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."
46,4,3,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not my own self."
46,4,4,"For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not thereby justified: but he that judges me is the Lord."
46,4,5,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God."
46,4,6,"And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another."
46,4,7,"For who makes you to differ from another? and what have you that you did not receive? now if you did receive it, why do you glory, as if you had not received it?"
46,4,8,"Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you."
46,4,9,"For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men."
46,4,10,"We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are despised."
46,4,11,"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place;"
46,4,12,"And labor, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure it:"
46,4,13,"Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the trash of all things unto this day."
46,4,14,"I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you."
46,4,15,"For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."
46,4,16,"Therefore I beseech you, be followers of me."
46,4,17,"For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church."
46,4,18,"Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you."
46,4,19,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and will know, not the speech of them who are puffed up, but the power."
46,4,20,"For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power."
46,4,21,"What do you wish? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?"
46,5,1,"It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife."
46,5,2,"And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you."
46,5,3,"For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,"
46,5,4,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
46,5,5,"To deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
46,5,6,"Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?"
46,5,7,"Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:"
46,5,8,"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
46,5,9,"I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:"
46,5,10,"Yet not entirely with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world."
46,5,11,"But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no not to eat."
46,5,12,"For what have I to do to judge them also that are outside? do not you judge them that are within?"
46,5,13,"But them that are outside God judges. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person."
46,6,1,"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?"
46,6,2,"Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?"
46,6,3,"Know you not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?"
46,6,4,"If then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church."
46,6,5,"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?"
46,6,6,"But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers."
46,6,7,"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because you go to law one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? why do you not rather allow yourselves to be defrauded?"
46,6,8,"Nay, you do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren."
46,6,9,"Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,"
46,6,10,"Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."
46,6,11,"And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."
46,6,12,"All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."
46,6,13,"Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body."
46,6,14,"And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power."
46,6,15,"Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of a harlot? God forbid."
46,6,16,"What? know you not that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? for two, says he, shall be one flesh."
46,6,17,"But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit."
46,6,18,"Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body; but he that commits fornication sins against his own body."
46,6,19,"What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have of God, and you are not your own?"
46,6,20,"For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."
46,7,1,"Now concerning the things of which you wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman."
46,7,2,"Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."
46,7,3,"Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband."
46,7,4,"The wife has not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband has not power over his own body, but the wife."
46,7,5,"Deprive not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your lack of self-control."
46,7,6,"But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment."
46,7,7,"For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man has his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that."
46,7,8,"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I."
46,7,9,"But if they cannot have self-control, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."
46,7,10,"And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:"
46,7,11,"But if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife."
46,7,12,"But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away."
46,7,13,"And the woman who has a husband that believes not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him."
46,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy."
46,7,15,"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace."
46,7,16,"For how do you know, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? or how do you know, O man, whether you shall save your wife?"
46,7,17,"But as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches."
46,7,18,"Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised."
46,7,19,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."
46,7,20,"Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called."
46,7,21,"Are you called being a servant? care not for it: but if you may be made free, use it rather."
46,7,22,"For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant."
46,7,23,"You are bought with a price; be not the servants of men."
46,7,24,"Brethren, let every man, however he is called, therein abide with God."
46,7,25,"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful."
46,7,26,"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be."
46,7,27,"Are you bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? seek not a wife."
46,7,28,"But if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you."
46,7,29,"But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;"
46,7,30,"And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;"
46,7,31,"And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away."
46,7,32,"But I would have you without concern. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:"
46,7,33,"But he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife."
46,7,34,"There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband."
46,7,35,"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is proper, and that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction."
46,7,36,"But if any man think that he behaves himself improperly toward his virgin, if she pass the prime of her age, and need so require, let him do what he desires, he sins not: let them marry."
46,7,37,"Nevertheless he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep her his virgin, does well."
46,7,38,"So then he that gives her in marriage does well; but he that gives her not in marriage does better."
46,7,39,"The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband is dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord."
46,7,40,"But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God."
46,8,1,"Now concerning things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies."
46,8,2,"And if any man thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know."
46,8,3,"But if any man loves God, the same is known by him."
46,8,4,"As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one."
46,8,5,"For though there be those called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)"
46,8,6,"But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him."
46,8,7,"But there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience about the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled."
46,8,8,"But food commends us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse."
46,8,9,"But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours becomes a stumbling block to them that are weak."
46,8,10,"For if any man sees you who have knowledge eating in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him who is weak be encouraged to eat those things which are offered to idols;"
46,8,11,"And through your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?"
46,8,12,"But when you sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ."
46,8,13,"Therefore, if food makes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat while the world stands, lest I make my brother to stumble."
46,9,1,"Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?"
46,9,2,"If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of my apostleship are you in the Lord."
46,9,3,"My answer to them that do examine me is this,"
46,9,4,"Have we not the right to eat and to drink?"
46,9,5,"Have we not the right to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?"
46,9,6,"Or I only and Barnabas, have not we the right to forbear working?"
46,9,7,"Who goes to warfare any time at his own expense? who plants a vineyard, and eats not of the fruit thereof? or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?"
46,9,8,"Say I these things as a man? or says not the law the same also?"
46,9,9,"For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the grain. Does God care for oxen?"
46,9,10,"Or says he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that plows should plow in hope; and that he that threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope."
46,9,11,"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your material things?"
46,9,12,"If others be partakers of this right over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this right; but endure all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ."
46,9,13,"Do you not know that they who minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they who wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?"
46,9,14,"Even so has the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should live of the gospel."
46,9,15,"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my boasting void."
46,9,16,"For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!"
46,9,17,"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a stewardship of the gospel is committed unto me."
46,9,18,"What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my right in the gospel."
46,9,19,"For though I am free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more."
46,9,20,"And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;"
46,9,21,"To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law of Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law."
46,9,22,"To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."
46,9,23,"And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you."
46,9,24,"Know you not that they who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain."
46,9,25,"And every man that strives for self control is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible."
46,9,26,"I therefore so run, not with uncertainty; so fight I, not as one that beats the air:"
46,9,27,"But I roughly treat my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be disqualified."
46,10,1,"Moreover, brethren, I want not that you should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"
46,10,2,"And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;"
46,10,3,"And did all eat the same spiritual food;"
46,10,4,"And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ."
46,10,5,"But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness."
46,10,6,"Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted."
46,10,7,"Neither be you idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."
46,10,8,"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand."
46,10,9,"Neither let us test Christ, as some of them also tested him, and were destroyed by serpents."
46,10,10,"Neither murmur you, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer."
46,10,11,"Now all these things happened unto them for examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come."
46,10,12,"Therefore let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall."
46,10,13,"There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it."
46,10,14,"Therefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry."
46,10,15,"I speak as to wise men; judge what I say."
46,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
46,10,17,"For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread."
46,10,18,"Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?"
46,10,19,"What do I say then? that the idol is anything, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything?"
46,10,20,"But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with demons."
46,10,21,"You cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of demons."
46,10,22,"Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?"
46,10,23,"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not."
46,10,24,"Let no man seek his own, but every man another's good."
46,10,25,"Whatsoever is sold in the meat market, that eat, asking no question for conscienceâ€™s sake:"
46,10,26,"For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof."
46,10,27,"If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and you be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscienceâ€™s sake."
46,10,28,"But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscienceâ€™s sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof:"
46,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not your own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged by another man's conscience?"
46,10,30,"For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
46,10,31,"Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God."
46,10,32,"Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:"
46,10,33,"Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved."
46,11,1,"Be followers of me, even as I also am of Christ."
46,11,2,"Now I praise you, brethren, because you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you."
46,11,3,"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God."
46,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head."
46,11,5,"But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head: for that is one and the same as if she were shaven."
46,11,6,"For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered."
46,11,7,"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man."
46,11,8,"For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man."
46,11,9,"Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man."
46,11,10,"For this cause ought the woman to have authority on her head because of the angels."
46,11,11,"Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord."
46,11,12,"For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God."
46,11,13,"Judge for yourselves: is it proper that a woman pray unto God uncovered?"
46,11,14,"Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man has long hair, it is a shame unto him?"
46,11,15,"But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering."
46,11,16,"But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God."
46,11,17,"Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse."
46,11,18,"For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it."
46,11,19,"For there must be also heresies among you, that they who are approved may be made manifest among you."
46,11,20,"When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper."
46,11,21,"For in eating every one takes first his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken."
46,11,22,"What? have you not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise you the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not."
46,11,23,"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:"
46,11,24,"And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said,"
46,11,25,"After the same manner also he took the cup, after he had eaten, saying,"
46,11,26,"For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he comes."
46,11,27,"Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."
46,11,28,"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup."
46,11,29,"For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord's body."
46,11,30,"For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep."
46,11,31,"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
46,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world."
46,11,33,"Therefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait one for another."
46,11,34,"And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order when I come."
46,12,1,"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant."
46,12,2,"You know that you were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as you were led."
46,12,3,"Therefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Spirit."
46,12,4,"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."
46,12,5,"And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord."
46,12,6,"And there are diversities of workings, but it is the same God who works all in all."
46,12,7,"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man for profit."
46,12,8,"For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;"
46,12,9,"To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;"
46,12,10,"To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another various kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:"
46,12,11,"But in all these works that one and same Spirit, dividing to every man individually as he will."
46,12,12,"For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ."
46,12,13,"For by one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."
46,12,14,"For the body is not one member, but many."
46,12,15,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
46,12,16,"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
46,12,17,"If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?"
46,12,18,"But now has God set the members every one of them in the body, as it has pleased him."
46,12,19,"And if they were all one member, where would be the body?"
46,12,20,"But now are they many members, yet but one body."
46,12,21,"And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of you: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
46,12,22,"Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:"
46,12,23,"And those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our less respectable parts have greater respect."
46,12,24,"For our more respectable parts have no need: but God has arranged the body together, having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked:"
46,12,25,"That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another."
46,12,26,"And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it."
46,12,27,"Now you are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
46,12,28,"And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helpers, administrators, various kinds of tongues."
46,12,29,"Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?"
46,12,30,"Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?"
46,12,31,"But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet I show unto you a more excellent way."
46,13,1,"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal."
46,13,2,"And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing."
46,13,3,"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profits me nothing."
46,13,4,"Love suffers long, and is kind; love envies not; love vaunts not itself, is not puffed up,"
46,13,5,"Does not behave itself rudely, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, keeps no record of evil;"
46,13,6,"Rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;"
46,13,7,"Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."
46,13,8,"Love never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away."
46,13,9,"For we know in part, and we prophesy in part."
46,13,10,"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."
46,13,11,"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."
46,13,12,"For now we see in a mirror dimly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."
46,13,13,"And now abides faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love."
46,14,1,"Follow after love, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy."
46,14,2,"For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not unto men, but unto God: for no man understands him; but in the spirit he speaks mysteries."
46,14,3,"But he that prophesies speaks unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort."
46,14,4,"He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church."
46,14,5,"I would that you all spoke with tongues, but rather that you prophesied: for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying."
46,14,6,"Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?"
46,14,7,"And even things without life which give sound, whether flute or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is played?"
46,14,8,"For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle?"
46,14,9,"So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for you shall speak into the air."
46,14,10,"There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without meaning."
46,14,11,"Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaks a foreigner, and he that speaks shall be a foreigner unto me."
46,14,12,"Even so you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church."
46,14,13,"Therefore let him that speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret."
46,14,14,"For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful."
46,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."
46,14,16,"Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the place of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you said?"
46,14,17,"For you verily give thanks well, but the other is not edified."
46,14,18,"I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:"
46,14,19,"Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."
46,14,20,"Brethren, be not children in understanding: but in malice be children, but in understanding be men."
46,14,21,"In the law it is written,"
46,14,22,"Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serves not for them that believe not, but for them that believe."
46,14,23,"If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?"
46,14,24,"But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convicted of all, he is judged of all:"
46,14,25,"And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth."
46,14,26,"How is it then, brethren? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying."
46,14,27,"If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that in turn; and let one interpret."
46,14,28,"But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God."
46,14,29,"Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the others judge."
46,14,30,"If anything be revealed to another that sits by, let the first hold his peace."
46,14,31,"For you may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted."
46,14,32,"And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets."
46,14,33,"For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints."
46,14,34,"Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be submissive, as also says the law."
46,14,35,"And if they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is shameful for women to speak in the church."
46,14,36,"What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?"
46,14,37,"If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord."
46,14,38,"But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant."
46,14,39,"Therefore, brethren, be eager to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues."
46,14,40,"Let all things be done decently and in order."
46,15,1,"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also you have received, and in which you stand;"
46,15,2,"By which also you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain."
46,15,3,"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;"
46,15,4,"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:"
46,15,5,"And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:"
46,15,6,"After that, he was seen of over five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep."
46,15,7,"After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles."
46,15,8,"And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one untimely born."
46,15,9,"For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God."
46,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
46,15,11,"Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so you believed."
46,15,12,"Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"
46,15,13,"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:"
46,15,14,"And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain."
46,15,15,"Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not."
46,15,16,"For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:"
46,15,17,"And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins."
46,15,18,"Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished."
46,15,19,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied."
46,15,20,"But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept."
46,15,21,"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead."
46,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
46,15,23,"But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming."
46,15,24,"Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power."
46,15,25,"For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet."
46,15,26,"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."
46,15,27,"For he has put all things under his feet. But when he says all things are put under him, it is clear that he is excepted, who did put all things under him."
46,15,28,"And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all."
46,15,29,"Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?"
46,15,30,"And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?"
46,15,31,"I protest by your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
46,15,32,"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what is the gain to me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die."
46,15,33,"Be not deceived: evil companions corrupt good morals."
46,15,34,"Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame."
46,15,35,"But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?"
46,15,36,"You fool, that which you sow is not made alive, except it die:"
46,15,37,"And that which you sow, you sow not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may by chance be wheat, or of some other grain:"
46,15,38,"But God gives it a body as it has pleased him, and to every seed its own body."
46,15,39,"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fish, and another of birds."
46,15,40,"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another."
46,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differs from another star in glory."
46,15,42,"So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:"
46,15,43,"It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:"
46,15,44,"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."
46,15,45,"And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a life-giving spirit."
46,15,46,"But that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual."
46,15,47,"The first man is of the earth, made of dust: the second man is the Lord from heaven."
46,15,48,"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly."
46,15,49,"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."
46,15,50,"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption."
46,15,51,"Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,"
46,15,52,"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."
46,15,53,"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality."
46,15,54,"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
46,15,55,""
46,15,56,"The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law."
46,15,57,"But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
46,15,58,"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, since you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord."
46,16,1,"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you."
46,16,2,"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come."
46,16,3,"And when I come, whomsoever you shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem."
46,16,4,"And if it be fitting that I go also, they shall go with me."
46,16,5,"Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia."
46,16,6,"And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that you may bring me on my journey wherever I go."
46,16,7,"For I will not see you now in passing; but I trust to tarry awhile with you, if the Lord permits."
46,16,8,"But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost."
46,16,9,"For a great and effective door is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries."
46,16,10,"Now if Timothy comes, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do."
46,16,11,"Let no man therefore despise him: but send him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren."
46,16,12,"Concerning our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have opportunity."
46,16,13,"Watch, stand fast in the faith, be men, be strong."
46,16,14,"Let all your things be done with love."
46,16,15,"I beseech you, brethren, (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)"
46,16,16,"That you submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that works with us, and labors."
46,16,17,"I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied."
46,16,18,"For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge them that are such."
46,16,19,"The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."
46,16,20,"All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss."
46,16,21,"The salutation is of me Paul with my own hand."
46,16,22,"If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha."
46,16,23,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."
46,16,24,"My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen."
47,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:"
47,1,2,"Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
47,1,3,"Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;"
47,1,4,"Who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any trouble, by the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted of God."
47,1,5,"For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ."
47,1,6,"And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation."
47,1,7,"And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation."
47,1,8,"For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life:"
47,1,9,"But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead:"
47,1,10,"Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;"
47,1,11,"You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf."
47,1,12,"For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you."
47,1,13,"For we write none other things unto you, than what you read or acknowledge; and I trust you shall acknowledge even to the end;"
47,1,14,"As also you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus."
47,1,15,"And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that you might have a second benefit;"
47,1,16,"And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be sent on my way toward Judea."
47,1,17,"When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?"
47,1,18,"But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay."
47,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silas and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea."
47,1,20,"For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us."
47,1,21,"Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God;"
47,1,22,"Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."
47,1,23,"Moreover I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth."
47,1,24,"Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith you stand."
47,2,1,"But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness."
47,2,2,"For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same who is made sorry by me?"
47,2,3,"And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all."
47,2,4,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you."
47,2,5,"But if any has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overburden you all."
47,2,6,"Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many."
47,2,7,"So that instead you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with too much sorrow."
47,2,8,"Therefore I beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him."
47,2,9,"For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things."
47,2,10,"To whom you forgive anything, I forgive also: for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes I forgave it in the person of Christ;"
47,2,11,"Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices."
47,2,12,"Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,"
47,2,13,"I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia."
47,2,14,"Now thanks be unto God, who always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the fragrance of his knowledge by us in every place."
47,2,15,"For we are unto God a sweet fragrance of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:"
47,2,16,"To the one we are the fragrance of death unto death; and to the other the fragrance of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?"
47,2,17,"For we are not as many, who corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ."
47,3,1,"Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?"
47,3,2,"You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:"
47,3,3,"Since you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart."
47,3,4,"And such trust have we through Christ toward God:"
47,3,5,"Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;"
47,3,6,"Who also has made us able ministers of the new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life."
47,3,7,"But if the ministry of death, written and engraved in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:"
47,3,8,"How shall not the ministry of the Spirit be more glorious?"
47,3,9,"For if the ministry of condemnation be glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness exceed in glory."
47,3,10,"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excels."
47,3,11,"For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remains is glorious."
47,3,12,"Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:"
47,3,13,"And not as Moses, who put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not steadfastly see the end of that which is abolished:"
47,3,14,"But their minds were blinded: for until this day remains the same veil not taken away in the reading of the old covenant; which veil is done away in Christ."
47,3,15,"But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their hearts."
47,3,16,"Nevertheless when one shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away."
47,3,17,"Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
47,3,18,"But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord."
47,4,1,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;"
47,4,2,"But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."
47,4,3,"But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:"
47,4,4,"In whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of them who believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."
47,4,5,"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake."
47,4,6,"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
47,4,7,"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."
47,4,8,"We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;"
47,4,9,"Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;"
47,4,10,"Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body."
47,4,11,"For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh."
47,4,12,"So then death works in us, but life in you."
47,4,13,"We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;"
47,4,14,"Knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you."
47,4,15,"For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many increase to the glory of God."
47,4,16,"For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day."
47,4,17,"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;"
47,4,18,"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."
47,5,1,"For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
47,5,2,"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:"
47,5,3,"If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked."
47,5,4,"For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."
47,5,5,"Now he that has made us for the same thing is God, who also has given unto us the earnest of the Spirit."
47,5,6,"Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:"
47,5,7,"(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)"
47,5,8,"We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord."
47,5,9,"Therefore we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him."
47,5,10,"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that everyone may be recompensed for the things done in his body, according to what he has done, whether it be good or bad."
47,5,11,"Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences."
47,5,12,"For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to boast on our behalf, that you may have something to answer them who boast in appearance, and not in heart."
47,5,13,"For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be in our right mind, it is for your cause."
47,5,14,"For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:"
47,5,15,"And that he died for all, that they who live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who died for them, and rose again."
47,5,16,"Therefore from now on know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet from now on know we him no more."
47,5,17,"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
47,5,18,"And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;"
47,5,19,"That is, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation."
47,5,20,"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God."
47,5,21,"For he has made him, who knew no sin, to be sin for us; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
47,6,1,"We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain."
47,6,2,"(For he says,"
47,6,3,"Giving no offense in anything, that the ministry be not blamed:"
47,6,4,"But in all things presenting ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,"
47,6,5,"In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;"
47,6,6,"By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by love unfeigned,"
47,6,7,"By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,"
47,6,8,"By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;"
47,6,9,"As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;"
47,6,10,"As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things."
47,6,11,"O you Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged."
47,6,12,"You are not constrained in us, but you are constrained in your own affections."
47,6,13,"Now in return for the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be you also enlarged in heart."
47,6,14,"Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what partnership has light with darkness?"
47,6,15,"And what harmony has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that believes with an infidel?"
47,6,16,"And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said,"
47,6,17,""
47,6,18,""
47,7,1,"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
47,7,2,"Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man."
47,7,3,"I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die and live with you."
47,7,4,"Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my boasting of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation."
47,7,5,"For, when we were come into Macedonia, our body had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears."
47,7,6,"Nevertheless God, who comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;"
47,7,7,"And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more."
47,7,8,"For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not regret, though I did regret: for I perceive that the same epistle has made you sorry, though it were but for a time."
47,7,9,"Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing."
47,7,10,"For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be regretted: but the sorrow of the world works death."
47,7,11,"For behold this same thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what earnestness it worked in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what full punishment! In all things you have proved yourselves to be pure in this matter."
47,7,12,"Therefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause who had done the wrong, nor for his cause who suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you."
47,7,13,"Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more we rejoiced at the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all."
47,7,14,"For if I have boasted anything to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found to be truth."
47,7,15,"And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him."
47,7,16,"I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things."
47,8,1,"Moreover, brethren, we want you to know of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;"
47,8,2,"How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality."
47,8,3,"For to their ability, I bear record, yea, and beyond their ability they were willing of themselves;"
47,8,4,"Begging us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints."
47,8,5,"And this they did, not as we expected, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God."
47,8,6,"So that we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also."
47,8,7,"Therefore, as you abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that you abound in this grace also."
47,8,8,"I speak not by commandment, but to prove by the earnestness of others, the sincerity of your love."
47,8,9,"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be rich."
47,8,10,"And in this I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to desire a year ago."
47,8,11,"Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which you have."
47,8,12,"For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man has, and not according to what he has not."
47,8,13,"For I mean not that other men be eased, and you burdened:"
47,8,14,"But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:"
47,8,15,"As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack."
47,8,16,"But thanks be to God, who put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you."
47,8,17,"For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more earnest, of his own accord he went unto you."
47,8,18,"And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;"
47,8,19,"And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and a testimony of your eagerness:"
47,8,20,"Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:"
47,8,21,"Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men."
47,8,22,"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you."
47,8,23,"If any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker concerning you: or if our brethren be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ."
47,8,24,"Therefore show to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf."
47,9,1,"For concerning the ministering to the saints, it is unnecessary for me to write to you:"
47,9,2,"For I know the eagerness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many."
47,9,3,"Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, you may be ready:"
47,9,4,"Lest perhaps if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting."
47,9,5,"Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your gift, of which you had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of gift, and not as an extortion."
47,9,6,"But this I say, He who sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he who sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully."
47,9,7,"Every man according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver."
47,9,8,"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:"
47,9,9,"(As it is written, He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor: his righteousness remains forever."
47,9,10,"Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)"
47,9,11,"Being enriched in everything to all bountifulness, who causes through us thanksgiving to God."
47,9,12,"For the administration of this service not only supplies the need of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;"
47,9,13,"While by the proof of this ministry they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;"
47,9,14,"And by their prayer for you, who long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you."
47,9,15,"Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift."
47,10,1,"Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am humble among you, but being absent am bold toward you:"
47,10,2,"But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, though I think to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh."
47,10,3,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh:"
47,10,4,"(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds;)"
47,10,5,"Casting down arguments, and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;"
47,10,6,"And having a readiness to punish all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled."
47,10,7,"Do you look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trusts to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's."
47,10,8,"For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:"
47,10,9,"That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters."
47,10,10,"For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible."
47,10,11,"Let such a one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present."
47,10,12,"For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."
47,10,13,"But we will not boast of things beyond our measure, but according to the measure of the field which God has distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you."
47,10,14,"For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:"
47,10,15,"Not boasting of things beyond our measure, that is, of other men's labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be strengthened by you according to our field abundantly,"
47,10,16,"To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's field of things made ready to our hand."
47,10,17,""
47,10,18,"For not he that commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends."
47,11,1,"I wish that you could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me."
47,11,2,"For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ."
47,11,3,"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his cunning, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."
47,11,4,"For if he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit, which you have not received, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you might well bear with him."
47,11,5,"For I suppose I was not the least behind the very chief apostles."
47,11,6,"But though I be unskilled in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things."
47,11,7,"Have I committed an offense in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?"
47,11,8,"I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service."
47,11,9,"And when I was present with you, and in want, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself."
47,11,10,"As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia."
47,11,11,"Why? because I love you not? God knows."
47,11,12,"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them who desire occasion; that when they glory, they may be found even as we."
47,11,13,"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ."
47,11,14,"And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light."
47,11,15,"Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works."
47,11,16,"I say again, Let no man think me foolish; but if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little."
47,11,17,"That which I speak, I speak it not according to the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting."
47,11,18,"Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will boast also."
47,11,19,"For you put up with fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise."
47,11,20,"For you permit it, if a man brings you into bondage, if a man devours you, if a man takes of you, if a man exalts himself, if a man smites you on the face."
47,11,21,"I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. But in whatsoever way any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also."
47,11,22,"Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the descendants of Abraham? so am I."
47,11,23,"Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in stripes beyond measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often."
47,11,24,"Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes less one."
47,11,25,"Three times was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, three times I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;"
47,11,26,"In journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;"
47,11,27,"In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness."
47,11,28,"Besides those things that are outside, that which comes upon me daily, the care of all the churches."
47,11,29,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?"
47,11,30,"If I must boast, I will boast of the things which concern my weaknesses."
47,11,31,"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forevermore, knows that I lie not."
47,11,32,"In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of Damascus with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:"
47,11,33,"And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands."
47,12,1,"It is not expedient for me doubtless to boast. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord."
47,12,2,"I knew a man in Christ fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such a one caught up to the third heaven."
47,12,3,"And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;)"
47,12,4,"How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."
47,12,5,"Of such a one will I boast: yet of myself I will not boast, but in my weaknesses."
47,12,6,"For though I would desire to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he sees me to be, or that he hears of me."
47,12,7,"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure."
47,12,8,"For this thing I besought the Lord three times, that it might depart from me."
47,12,9,"And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."
47,12,10,"Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong."
47,12,11,"I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended by you: for in nothing am I behind the very chief apostles, though I be nothing."
47,12,12,"Truly the signs of an apostle were done among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds."
47,12,13,"For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong."
47,12,14,"Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
47,12,15,"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you, though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved."
47,12,16,"But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I took you with guile."
47,12,17,"Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?"
47,12,18,"I urged Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?"
47,12,19,"Again, do you think that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying."
47,12,20,"For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and that I shall be found unto you such as you desire not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, conceit, tumults:"
47,12,21,"And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn over many who have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and licentiousness which they have committed."
47,13,1,"This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."
47,13,2,"I told you before, and tell you again, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them who earlier have sinned, and to all others, that, if I come again, I will not spare:"
47,13,3,"Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who toward you is not weak, but is mighty in you."
47,13,4,"For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you."
47,13,5,"Examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith; prove your own selves. Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are counterfeits?"
47,13,6,"But I trust that you shall know that we are not counterfeits."
47,13,7,"Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we be as failures."
47,13,8,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
47,13,9,"For we are glad, when we are weak, and you are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection."
47,13,10,"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction."
47,13,11,"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be restored, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you."
47,13,12,"Greet one another with a holy kiss."
47,13,13,"All the saints greet you."
47,13,14,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. Amen."
48,1,1,"Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)"
48,1,2,"And all the brethren who are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:"
48,1,3,"Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,"
48,1,4,"Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God our Father:"
48,1,5,"To whom be glory forever and ever. Amen."
48,1,6,"I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:"
48,1,7,"Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ."
48,1,8,"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."
48,1,9,"As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received, let him be accursed."
48,1,10,"For do I now seek the favor of men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ."
48,1,11,"But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man."
48,1,12,"For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."
48,1,13,"For you have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:"
48,1,14,"And advanced in the Jews' religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers."
48,1,15,"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,"
48,1,16,"To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:"
48,1,17,"Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them who were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus."
48,1,18,"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days."
48,1,19,"But other of the apostles saw I none, except James the Lord's brother."
48,1,20,"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not."
48,1,21,"Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;"
48,1,22,"And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judea which were in Christ:"
48,1,23,"But they had heard only, That he who persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed."
48,1,24,"And they glorified God in me."
48,2,1,"Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also."
48,2,2,"And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain."
48,2,3,"But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:"
48,2,4,"And because of false brethren brought in unawares, who came in secretly to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:"
48,2,5,"To whom we yielded in subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you."
48,2,6,"But of these who seemed to be somebody, (whatsoever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somebody in conference added nothing to me:"
48,2,7,"But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;"
48,2,8,"(For he that worked effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)"
48,2,9,"And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship; that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision."
48,2,10,"Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was eager to do."
48,2,11,"But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed."
48,2,12,"For before certain men came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision."
48,2,13,"And the other Jews joined likewise with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their hypocrisy."
48,2,14,"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"
48,2,15,"We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,"
48,2,16,"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."
48,2,17,"But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid."
48,2,18,"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor."
48,2,19,"For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God."
48,2,20,"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."
48,2,21,"I do not nullify the grace of God: for if righteousness comes by the law, then Christ is dead in vain."
48,3,1,"O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been openly set forth, crucified among you?"
48,3,2,"This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
48,3,3,"Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect by the flesh?"
48,3,4,"Have you suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain."
48,3,5,"He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
48,3,6,"Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."
48,3,7,"Know you therefore that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham."
48,3,8,"And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying,"
48,3,9,"So then they who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham."
48,3,10,"For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them."
48,3,11,"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for,"
48,3,12,"And the law is not of faith: but,"
48,3,13,"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:"
48,3,14,"That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
48,3,15,"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannuls, or adds thereto."
48,3,16,"Now to Abraham and his descendant were the promises made. He says not, And to descendants, as of many; but as of one,"
48,3,17,"And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before by God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of no effect."
48,3,18,"For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise."
48,3,19,"Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the descendant should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator."
48,3,20,"Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one."
48,3,21,"Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law."
48,3,22,"But the scripture has consigned all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."
48,3,23,"But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed."
48,3,24,"Therefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith."
48,3,25,"But after faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."
48,3,26,"For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus."
48,3,27,"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ."
48,3,28,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
48,3,29,"And if you are Christ's, then are you Abraham's descendants, and heirs according to the promise."
48,4,1,"Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;"
48,4,2,"But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father."
48,4,3,"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:"
48,4,4,"But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,"
48,4,5,"To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons."
48,4,6,"And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying,"
48,4,7,"Therefore you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
48,4,8,"But then, when you knew not God, you did service unto them which by nature are no gods."
48,4,9,"But now, after you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage?"
48,4,10,"You observe days, and months, and times, and years."
48,4,11,"I am afraid for you, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain."
48,4,12,"Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as you are: you have not injured me at all."
48,4,13,"You know how through weakness of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first."
48,4,14,"And my trial which was in my flesh you despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus."
48,4,15,"Where is then the blessedness you spoke of? for I bear you witness, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me."
48,4,16,"Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?"
48,4,17,"They are zealous of you, but not for good; yea, they would exclude you, that you might be zealous of them."
48,4,18,"But it is good to be zealous always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you."
48,4,19,"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,"
48,4,20,"I desire to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I stand in doubt of you."
48,4,21,"Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?"
48,4,22,"For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a free woman."
48,4,23,"But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the free woman was by promise."
48,4,24,"Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from mount Sinai, which brings forth to bondage, which is Hagar."
48,4,25,"For this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children."
48,4,26,"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all."
48,4,27,"For it is written,"
48,4,28,"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise."
48,4,29,"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now."
48,4,30,"Nevertheless what says the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman."
48,4,31,"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."
48,5,1,"Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
48,5,2,"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."
48,5,3,"For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
48,5,4,"Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace."
48,5,5,"For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith."
48,5,6,"For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love."
48,5,7,"You did run well; who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?"
48,5,8,"This persuasion comes not of him that calls you."
48,5,9,"A little leaven leavens the whole lump."
48,5,10,"I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will not be otherwise minded: but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be."
48,5,11,"And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased."
48,5,12,"I would they were even cut off who trouble you."
48,5,13,"For, brethren, you have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another."
48,5,14,"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this;"
48,5,15,"But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another."
48,5,16,"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh."
48,5,17,"For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would."
48,5,18,"But if you be led of the Spirit, you are not under the law."
48,5,19,"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, impurity, licentiousness,"
48,5,20,"Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strife, jealousy, wrath, selfishness, divisions, heresies,"
48,5,21,"Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of which I tell you beforehand, as I have also told you in time past, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
48,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,"
48,5,23,"Meekness, self-control: against such there is no law."
48,5,24,"And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts."
48,5,25,"If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."
48,5,26,"Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another."
48,6,1,"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted."
48,6,2,"Bear you one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ."
48,6,3,"For if a man thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself."
48,6,4,"But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another."
48,6,5,"For every man shall bear his own burden."
48,6,6,"Let him that is taught in the word share with him that teaches in all good things."
48,6,7,"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap."
48,6,8,"For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting."
48,6,9,"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."
48,6,10,"As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith."
48,6,11,"You see with what large letters I have written unto you with my own hand."
48,6,12,"As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ."
48,6,13,"For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh."
48,6,14,"But God forbid that I should glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world."
48,6,15,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation."
48,6,16,"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God."
48,6,17,"From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."
48,6,18,"Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
49,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:"
49,1,2,"Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
49,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:"
49,1,4,"According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:"
49,1,5,"Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,"
49,1,6,"To the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he has made us accepted in the beloved."
49,1,7,"In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;"
49,1,8,"Which he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;"
49,1,9,"Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:"
49,1,10,"That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:"
49,1,11,"In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:"
49,1,12,"That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ."
49,1,13,"In whom you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise,"
49,1,14,"Who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory."
49,1,15,"Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,"
49,1,16,"Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;"
49,1,17,"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:"
49,1,18,"The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,"
49,1,19,"And what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,"
49,1,20,"Which he performed in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,"
49,1,21,"Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come:"
49,1,22,"And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,"
49,1,23,"Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all."
49,2,1,"And you has he made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins:"
49,2,2,"In which in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:"
49,2,3,"Among whom also we all had our behavior in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others."
49,2,4,"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,"
49,2,5,"Even when we were dead in sins, has made us alive together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)"
49,2,6,"And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:"
49,2,7,"That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus."
49,2,8,"For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:"
49,2,9,"Not of works, lest any man should boast."
49,2,10,"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them."
49,2,11,"Therefore remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;"
49,2,12,"That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:"
49,2,13,"But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near by the blood of Christ."
49,2,14,"For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;"
49,2,15,"Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;"
49,2,16,"And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:"
49,2,17,"And came and preached peace to you who were afar off, and to them that were near."
49,2,18,"For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father."
49,2,19,"Now therefore you are no more strangers and sojourners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;"
49,2,20,"And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone;"
49,2,21,"In whom all the building fitly framed together grows unto a holy temple in the Lord:"
49,2,22,"In whom you also are built together for a habitation of God through the Spirit."
49,3,1,"For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,"
49,3,2,"If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me toward you:"
49,3,3,"How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,"
49,3,4,"By which, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)"
49,3,5,"Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;"
49,3,6,"That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:"
49,3,7,"Of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power."
49,3,8,"Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;"
49,3,9,"And to make all men see what is the plan of the mystery, which from the beginning of the ages has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:"
49,3,10,"To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,"
49,3,11,"According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:"
49,3,12,"In whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in him."
49,3,13,"Therefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory."
49,3,14,"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
49,3,15,"Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,"
49,3,16,"That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;"
49,3,17,"That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,"
49,3,18,"May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;"
49,3,19,"And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God."
49,3,20,"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,"
49,3,21,"Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."
49,4,1,"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation by which you are called,"
49,4,2,"With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;"
49,4,3,"Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
49,4,4,"There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;"
49,4,5,"One Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
49,4,6,"One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."
49,4,7,"But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ."
49,4,8,"Therefore he says, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men."
49,4,9,"(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"
49,4,10,"He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)"
49,4,11,"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;"
49,4,12,"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:"
49,4,13,"Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:"
49,4,14,"That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, by which they lie in wait to deceive;"
49,4,15,"But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, who is the head, even Christ:"
49,4,16,"From whom the whole body being fitly joined together and knit together by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
49,4,17,"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,"
49,4,18,"Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:"
49,4,19,"Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto licentiousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness."
49,4,20,"But you have not so learned Christ;"
49,4,21,"If so be that you have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:"
49,4,22,"That you put off concerning the former way of life the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;"
49,4,23,"And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;"
49,4,24,"And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."
49,4,25,"Therefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another."
49,4,26,"Be angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:"
49,4,27,"Neither give place to the devil."
49,4,28,"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs."
49,4,29,"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers."
49,4,30,"And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, by whom you are sealed unto the day of redemption."
49,4,31,"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:"
49,4,32,"And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you."
49,5,1,"Be you therefore followers of God, as dear children;"
49,5,2,"And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling fragrance."
49,5,3,"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;"
49,5,4,"Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not fitting: but rather giving of thanks."
49,5,5,"For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
49,5,6,"Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things comes the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience."
49,5,7,"Be not therefore partakers with them."
49,5,8,"For you were once darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:"
49,5,9,"(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)"
49,5,10,"Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord."
49,5,11,"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them."
49,5,12,"For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret."
49,5,13,"But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever does make manifest is light."
49,5,14,"Therefore he says, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light."
49,5,15,"See then that you walk carefully, not as fools, but as wise,"
49,5,16,"Redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
49,5,17,"Therefore be not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is."
49,5,18,"And be not drunk with wine, in which is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;"
49,5,19,"Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;"
49,5,20,"Giving thanks always for all things unto God, even the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
49,5,21,"Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God."
49,5,22,"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord."
49,5,23,"For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body."
49,5,24,"Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing."
49,5,25,"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;"
49,5,26,"That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,"
49,5,27,"That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."
49,5,28,"So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself."
49,5,29,"For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord the church:"
49,5,30,"For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."
49,5,31,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh."
49,5,32,"This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church."
49,5,33,"Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she respect her husband."
49,6,1,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right."
49,6,2,""
49,6,3,""
49,6,4,"And, you fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."
49,6,5,"Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;"
49,6,6,"Not with eye service, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;"
49,6,7,"With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:"
49,6,8,"Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free."
49,6,9,"And, you masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him."
49,6,10,"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might."
49,6,11,"Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
49,6,12,"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places."
49,6,13,"Therefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
49,6,14,"Stand therefore, having your loins girded about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;"
49,6,15,"And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;"
49,6,16,"Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one."
49,6,17,"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:"
49,6,18,"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thus with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;"
49,6,19,"And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,"
49,6,20,"For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that in this I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
49,6,21,"But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:"
49,6,22,"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that you might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts."
49,6,23,"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
49,6,24,"Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen."
50,1,1,"Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:"
50,1,2,"Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
50,1,3,"I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,"
50,1,4,"Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,"
50,1,5,"For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;"
50,1,6,"Being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:"
50,1,7,"Even as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; since as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace."
50,1,8,"For God is my witness, how greatly I long after you all in the affections of Jesus Christ."
50,1,9,"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;"
50,1,10,"That you may approve things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ;"
50,1,11,"Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God."
50,1,12,"But I wish you to understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have served rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;"
50,1,13,"So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;"
50,1,14,"And many of the brethren in the Lord, becoming confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear."
50,1,15,"Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:"
50,1,16,"The one preach Christ out of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:"
50,1,17,"But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel."
50,1,18,"What then? only that, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice."
50,1,19,"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"
50,1,20,"According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death."
50,1,21,"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
50,1,22,"But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not."
50,1,23,"For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:"
50,1,24,"Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you."
50,1,25,"And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;"
50,1,26,"That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again."
50,1,27,"Only let your manner of life be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;"
50,1,28,"And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that of God."
50,1,29,"For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;"
50,1,30,"Having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me."
50,2,1,"If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affections and mercies,"
50,2,2,"Fulfill you my joy, that you be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind."
50,2,3,"Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves."
50,2,4,"Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others."
50,2,5,"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:"
50,2,6,"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not a thing to be grasped to be equal with God:"
50,2,7,"But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:"
50,2,8,"And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."
50,2,9,"Therefore God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:"
50,2,10,"That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;"
50,2,11,"And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
50,2,12,"Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
50,2,13,"For it is God who works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure."
50,2,14,"Do all things without murmuring and disputing:"
50,2,15,"That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;"
50,2,16,"Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain."
50,2,17,"Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all."
50,2,18,"For the same cause also do you joy, and rejoice with me."
50,2,19,"But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state."
50,2,20,"For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state."
50,2,21,"For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's."
50,2,22,"But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel."
50,2,23,"Him therefore I hope to send presently, as soon as I shall see how it will go with me."
50,2,24,"But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly."
50,2,25,"Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants."
50,2,26,"For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because you had heard that he had been sick."
50,2,27,"For indeed he was sick near unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow."
50,2,28,"I sent him therefore the more eagerly, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful."
50,2,29,"Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in honor:"
50,2,30,"Because for the work of Christ he was near unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me."
50,3,1,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not troublesome, but for you it is safe."
50,3,2,"Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the mutilators."
50,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh."
50,3,4,"Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has reasons he might trust in the flesh, I more:"
50,3,5,"Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;"
50,3,6,"Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless."
50,3,7,"But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ."
50,3,8,"Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but rubbish, that I may win Christ,"
50,3,9,"And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:"
50,3,10,"That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;"
50,3,11,"If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead."
50,3,12,"Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if indeed I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus."
50,3,13,"Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,"
50,3,14,"I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
50,3,15,"Let us therefore, as many as would be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you."
50,3,16,"Nevertheless, to what we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing."
50,3,17,"Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them who so walk, since you have us for an example."
50,3,18,"(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:"
50,3,19,"Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)"
50,3,20,"For our citizenship is in heaven; from which also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:"
50,3,21,"Who shall change our humble body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working by which he is able even to subdue all things unto himself."
50,4,1,"Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved."
50,4,2,"I urge Euodias, and urge Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord."
50,4,3,"And I entreat you also, true yokefellow, help those women who labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other of my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life."
50,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice."
50,4,5,"Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand."
50,4,6,"Be anxious for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God."
50,4,7,"And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
50,4,8,"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things."
50,4,9,"Those things, which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you."
50,4,10,"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; in which you were also concerned, but you lacked opportunity."
50,4,11,"Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content."
50,4,12,"I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need."
50,4,13,"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
50,4,14,"Nevertheless you have done well, that you did share in my affliction."
50,4,15,"Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only."
50,4,16,"For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again unto my necessity."
50,4,17,"Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account."
50,4,18,"But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God."
50,4,19,"But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus."
50,4,20,"Now unto God and our Father be glory forever and ever. Amen."
50,4,21,"Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you."
50,4,22,"All the saints greet you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household."
50,4,23,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen."
51,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,"
51,1,2,"To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
51,1,3,"We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
51,1,4,"Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,"
51,1,5,"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;"
51,1,6,"Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:"
51,1,7,"As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;"
51,1,8,"Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit."
51,1,9,"For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;"
51,1,10,"That you might walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;"
51,1,11,"Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;"
51,1,12,"Giving thanks unto the Father, who has made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:"
51,1,13,"Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:"
51,1,14,"In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:"
51,1,15,"Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation:"
51,1,16,"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:"
51,1,17,"And he is before all things, and by him all things are held together."
51,1,18,"And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence."
51,1,19,"For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;"
51,1,20,"And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven."
51,1,21,"And you, that were once alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled"
51,1,22,"In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight:"
51,1,23,"If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature who is under heaven; of which I Paul am made a minister;"
51,1,24,"Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:"
51,1,25,"Of which I am made a minister, according to the commission of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;"
51,1,26,"Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:"
51,1,27,"To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:"
51,1,28,"Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:"
51,1,29,"For which I also labor, striving according to his working, who works in me mightily."
51,2,1,"For I desire that you know what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;"
51,2,2,"That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;"
51,2,3,"In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
51,2,4,"And this I say, lest any man should deceive you with enticing words."
51,2,5,"For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ."
51,2,6,"As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him:"
51,2,7,"Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving."
51,2,8,"Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ."
51,2,9,"For in him dwells all the fullness of the Deity bodily."
51,2,10,"And you are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power:"
51,2,11,"In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:"
51,2,12,"Buried with him in baptism, in which also you are risen with him through the faith of the working of God, who has raised him from the dead."
51,2,13,"And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he made alive together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;"
51,2,14,"Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;"
51,2,15,"And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it."
51,2,16,"Let no man therefore judge you in food, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:"
51,2,17,"Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ."
51,2,18,"Let no man deceive you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,"
51,2,19,"And not holding the Head, from whom all the body by joints and ligaments having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God."
51,2,20,"Therefore if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to ordinances,"
51,2,21,"(Touch not; taste not; handle not;"
51,2,22,"Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?"
51,2,23,"Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in self-imposed worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any value to the indulgence of the flesh."
51,3,1,"If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God."
51,3,2,"Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."
51,3,3,"For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."
51,3,4,"When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory."
51,3,5,"Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry:"
51,3,6,"For which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience:"
51,3,7,"In which you also once walked, when you lived in them."
51,3,8,"But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy talk out of your mouth."
51,3,9,"Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;"
51,3,10,"And have put on the new man, that is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:"
51,3,11,"Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all."
51,3,12,"Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, compassion, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;"
51,3,13,"Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you."
51,3,14,"And above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection."
51,3,15,"And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you are called in one body; and be thankful."
51,3,16,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord."
51,3,17,"And whatsoever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father by him."
51,3,18,"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fitting in the Lord."
51,3,19,"Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them."
51,3,20,"Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord."
51,3,21,"Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."
51,3,22,"Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:"
51,3,23,"And whatsoever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;"
51,3,24,"Knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ."
51,3,25,"But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done: and there is no respect of persons."
51,4,1,"Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven."
51,4,2,"Continue in prayer, and watch in it with thanksgiving;"
51,4,3,"Praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:"
51,4,4,"That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak."
51,4,5,"Walk in wisdom toward them that are outsiders, redeeming the time."
51,4,6,"Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man."
51,4,7,"All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:"
51,4,8,"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your state, and comfort your hearts;"
51,4,9,"With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here."
51,4,10,"Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark, cousin to Barnabas, (concerning whom you received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)"
51,4,11,"And Jesus, who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellow workers unto the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort unto me."
51,4,12,"Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God."
51,4,13,"For I bear him witness, that he has a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea and them in Hierapolis."
51,4,14,"Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you."
51,4,15,"Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house."
51,4,16,"And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea."
51,4,17,"And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it."
51,4,18,"The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen."
52,1,1,"Paul, and Silas, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
52,1,2,"We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;"
52,1,3,"Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;"
52,1,4,"Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God."
52,1,5,"For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake."
52,1,6,"And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit:"
52,1,7,"So that you were examples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia."
52,1,8,"For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak anything."
52,1,9,"For they themselves show of us what manner of welcome we had unto you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;"
52,1,10,"And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come."
52,2,1,"For yourselves, brethren, know our visit unto you, that it was not in vain:"
52,2,2,"But even after we had suffered before, and were shamefully treated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much opposition."
52,2,3,"For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:"
52,2,4,"But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts."
52,2,5,"For neither at any time used we flattering words, as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness; God is witness:"
52,2,6,"Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ."
52,2,7,"But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:"
52,2,8,"So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because you were dear unto us."
52,2,9,"For you remember, brethren, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be a burden unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God."
52,2,10,"You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and just and unblamable was our behavior among you that believe:"
52,2,11,"As you know how we exhorted and encouraged and charged every one of you, as a father does his children,"
52,2,12,"That you would walk worthy of God, who has called you unto his kingdom and glory."
52,2,13,"For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe."
52,2,14,"For you, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:"
52,2,15,"Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:"
52,2,16,"Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost."
52,2,17,"But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire."
52,2,18,"Therefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us."
52,2,19,"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?"
52,2,20,"For you are our glory and joy."
52,3,1,"Therefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;"
52,3,2,"And sent Timothy, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to encourage you concerning your faith:"
52,3,3,"That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for you yourselves know that we are appointed unto this."
52,3,4,"For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and you know."
52,3,5,"For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor be in vain."
52,3,6,"But now when Timothy came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and love, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:"
52,3,7,"Therefore, brethren, we were encouraged over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:"
52,3,8,"For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord."
52,3,9,"For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy with which we joy for your sakes before our God;"
52,3,10,"Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
52,3,11,"Now God himself even our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you."
52,3,12,"And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:"
52,3,13,"To the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."
52,4,1,"Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more."
52,4,2,"For you know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus."
52,4,3,"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:"
52,4,4,"That every one of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor;"
52,4,5,"Not in the lust of passion, even as the Gentiles who know not God:"
52,4,6,"That no man transgress and wrong his brother in any matter: because the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified."
52,4,7,"For God has not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness."
52,4,8,"He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given unto us his Holy Spirit."
52,4,9,"But concerning brotherly love you need not that I write unto you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another."
52,4,10,"And indeed you do it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that you increase more and more;"
52,4,11,"And that you study to be quiet, and to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;"
52,4,12,"That you may walk honestly toward them that are outside, and that you may have lack of nothing."
52,4,13,"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them who are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others who have no hope."
52,4,14,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also who sleep in Jesus will God bring with him."
52,4,15,"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not precede them who are asleep."
52,4,16,"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:"
52,4,17,"Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."
52,4,18,"Therefore comfort one another with these words."
52,5,1,"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I write unto you."
52,5,2,"For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night."
52,5,3,"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape."
52,5,4,"But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."
52,5,5,"You are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."
52,5,6,"Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober."
52,5,7,"For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that are drunk are drunk in the night."
52,5,8,"But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation."
52,5,9,"For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,"
52,5,10,"Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him."
52,5,11,"Therefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do."
52,5,12,"And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;"
52,5,13,"And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves."
52,5,14,"Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are idle, encourage the faint-hearted, support the weak, be patient toward all men."
52,5,15,"See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men."
52,5,16,"Rejoice evermore."
52,5,17,"Pray without ceasing."
52,5,18,"In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."
52,5,19,"Quench not the Spirit."
52,5,20,"Despise not prophesying."
52,5,21,"Test all things; hold fast that which is good."
52,5,22,"Abstain from all appearance of evil."
52,5,23,"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
52,5,24,"Faithful is he that calls you, who also will do it."
52,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us."
52,5,26,"Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss."
52,5,27,"I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren."
52,5,28,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen."
53,1,1,"Paul, and Silas, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
53,1,2,"Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,1,3,"We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all toward each other abounds;"
53,1,4,"So that we ourselves boast of you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure:"
53,1,5,"Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:"
53,1,6,"Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;"
53,1,7,"And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,"
53,1,8,"In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
53,1,9,"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"
53,1,10,"When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day."
53,1,11,"Therefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:"
53,1,12,"That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,1,"Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,"
53,2,2,"That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, that the day of the Lord is at hand."
53,2,3,"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come the falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;"
53,2,4,"Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God."
53,2,5,"Do you not remember, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"
53,2,6,"And now you know what restrains that he might be revealed in his time."
53,2,7,"For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now restrains will do so, until he be taken out of the way."
53,2,8,"And then shall that Wicked One be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:"
53,2,9,"Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,"
53,2,10,"And with all deception of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
53,2,11,"And for this cause God shall send them a strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:"
53,2,12,"That they all might be condemned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
53,2,13,"But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:"
53,2,14,"To which he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
53,2,15,"Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle."
53,2,16,"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, who has loved us, and has given us everlasting encouragement and good hope through grace,"
53,2,17,"Encourage your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work."
53,3,1,"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:"
53,3,2,"And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith."
53,3,3,"But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil."
53,3,4,"And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things which we command you."
53,3,5,"And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ."
53,3,6,"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received from us."
53,3,7,"For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;"
53,3,8,"Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you:"
53,3,9,"Not because we have not that right, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us."
53,3,10,"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
53,3,11,"For we hear that there are some who walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies."
53,3,12,"Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread."
53,3,13,"But you, brethren, be not weary in well doing."
53,3,14,"And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed."
53,3,15,"Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."
53,3,16,"Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all."
53,3,17,"The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is a sign in every epistle: so I write."
53,3,18,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen."
54,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is our hope;"
54,1,2,"Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord."
54,1,3,"As I besought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,"
54,1,4,"Neither give heed to myths and endless genealogies, which cause questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do."
54,1,5,"Now the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:"
54,1,6,"From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talk;"
54,1,7,"Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor the things they affirm."
54,1,8,"But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully;"
54,1,9,"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
54,1,10,"For fornicators, for homosexuals, for slave traders, for liars, for perjurers, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;"
54,1,11,"According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust."
54,1,12,"And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;"
54,1,13,"Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and insolent: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."
54,1,14,"And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
54,1,15,"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."
54,1,16,"But for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for an example to them who should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting."
54,1,17,"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."
54,1,18,"This charge I commit unto you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which were made concerning you, that you by them might war a good warfare;"
54,1,19,"Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made it shipwreck:"
54,1,20,"Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."
54,2,1,"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;"
54,2,2,"For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."
54,2,3,"For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;"
54,2,4,"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."
54,2,5,"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;"
54,2,6,"Who gave himself a ransom for all, this to be a testimony at the proper time."
54,2,7,"To this I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth."
54,2,8,"I desire therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting."
54,2,9,"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with decency and propriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;"
54,2,10,"But (as becomes women professing godliness) with good works."
54,2,11,"Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection."
54,2,12,"But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have authority over the man, but to be in silence."
54,2,13,"For Adam was first formed, then Eve."
54,2,14,"And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression."
54,2,15,"Yet she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with propriety."
54,3,1,"This is a true saying, If a man desires the office of a bishop, he desires a good work."
54,3,2,"A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;"
54,3,3,"Not given to wine, not violent, not greedy of money; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;"
54,3,4,"One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all respect;"
54,3,5,"(For if a man knows not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)"
54,3,6,"Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil."
54,3,7,"Moreover he must have a good report of them who are outside; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil."
54,3,8,"Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of dishonest gain;"
54,3,9,"Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience."
54,3,10,"And let these also first be tested; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless."
54,3,11,"Even so must their wives be serious, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things."
54,3,12,"Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
54,3,13,"For they that have used the office of a deacon well gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus."
54,3,14,"These things write I unto you, hoping to come unto you shortly:"
54,3,15,"But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
54,3,16,"And without doubt great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."
54,4,1,"Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to deceitful spirits, and doctrines of demons;"
54,4,2,"Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;"
54,4,3,"Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them who believe and know the truth."
54,4,4,"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:"
54,4,5,"For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer."
54,4,6,"If you put the brethren in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, which you have attained."
54,4,7,"But refuse profane and old wives' tales, and exercise yourself rather unto godliness."
54,4,8,"For bodily exercise profits for a little while: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."
54,4,9,"This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance."
54,4,10,"For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those that believe."
54,4,11,"These things command and teach."
54,4,12,"Let no man despise your youth; but be an example of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity."
54,4,13,"Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."
54,4,14,"Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you through prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery."
54,4,15,"Meditate upon these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your progress may appear to all."
54,4,16,"Take heed unto yourself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you."
54,5,1,"Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as brothers;"
54,5,2,"The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity."
54,5,3,"Honor widows that are widows indeed."
54,5,4,"But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety at home, and so repay their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God."
54,5,5,"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day."
54,5,6,"But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives."
54,5,7,"And these things give in a charge, that they may be blameless."
54,5,8,"But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever."
54,5,9,"Let not a widow be put on the list under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,"
54,5,10,"Well reported of for good works; if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work."
54,5,11,"But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ, they will marry;"
54,5,12,"Having judgment, because they have cast off their first faith."
54,5,13,"And at the same time they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but gossips also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not."
54,5,14,"I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, rule the house, give no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully."
54,5,15,"For some are already turned aside after Satan."
54,5,16,"If any man or woman that believes has widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed."
54,5,17,"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine."
54,5,18,"For the scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward."
54,5,19,"Against an elder receive not an accusation, unless before two or three witnesses."
54,5,20,"Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear."
54,5,21,"I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality."
54,5,22,"Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure."
54,5,23,"Drink no longer water only, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent illnesses."
54,5,24,"Some men's sins are evident beforehand, going before them to judgment; and some men they follow after."
54,5,25,"Likewise also the good works of some are evident beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid."
54,6,1,"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed."
54,6,2,"And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are believers and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort."
54,6,3,"If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;"
54,6,4,"He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting over questions and disputes of words, out of which comes envy, strife, railings, evil suspicions,"
54,6,5,"Perverse wranglings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw yourself."
54,6,6,"But godliness with contentment is great gain."
54,6,7,"For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out."
54,6,8,"And having food and clothing let us be with these things content."
54,6,9,"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which plunge men into destruction and perdition."
54,6,10,"For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
54,6,11,"But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness."
54,6,12,"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses."
54,6,13,"I give you charge in the sight of God, who brings all things to life, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;"
54,6,14,"That you keep this commandment without spot, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
54,6,15,"Who in his times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;"
54,6,16,"Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen."
54,6,17,"Charge them that are rich in this present age, that they be not haughty, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;"
54,6,18,"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to share;"
54,6,19,"Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."
54,6,20,"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain utterances, and oppositions of what is falsely called knowledge:"
54,6,21,"Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen."
55,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,"
55,1,2,"To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
55,1,3,"I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;"
55,1,4,"Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;"
55,1,5,"When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded in you also."
55,1,6,"Therefore I remind you that you stir up the gift of God, which is in you by the laying on of my hands."
55,1,7,"For God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."
55,1,8,"Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;"
55,1,9,"Who has saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,"
55,1,10,"But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:"
55,1,11,"For which I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."
55,1,12,"For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day."
55,1,13,"Hold fast the pattern of sound words, which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
55,1,14,"That good thing which was committed unto you keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us."
55,1,15,"This you know, that all they who are in Asia are turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes."
55,1,16,"The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chains:"
55,1,17,"But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me."
55,1,18,"The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, you know very well."
55,2,1,"You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
55,2,2,"And the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."
55,2,3,"You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ."
55,2,4,"No man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier."
55,2,5,"And if a man also competes as an athlete, yet is he not crowned, unless he strives lawfully."
55,2,6,"The farmer that labors must be first partaker of the fruits."
55,2,7,"Consider what I say; and the Lord give you understanding in all things."
55,2,8,"Remember that Jesus Christ, descended from David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel:"
55,2,9,"In which I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound."
55,2,10,"Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
55,2,11,"It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:"
55,2,12,"If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:"
55,2,13,"If we believe not, yet he abides faithful: he cannot deny himself."
55,2,14,"Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the ruin of the hearers."
55,2,15,"Study to show yourself approved unto God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
55,2,16,"But shun profane and vain utterances: for they will increase unto more ungodliness."
55,2,17,"And their word will eat as does a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;"
55,2,18,"Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some."
55,2,19,"Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity."
55,2,20,"But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor."
55,2,21,"If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and fit for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work."
55,2,22,"Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
55,2,23,"But foolish and ignorant questions avoid, knowing that they do produce strifes."
55,2,24,"And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,"
55,2,25,"In meekness instructing those that oppose them; if God perhaps will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;"
55,2,26,"And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will."
55,3,1,"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."
55,3,2,"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,"
55,3,3,"Without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,"
55,3,4,"Traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;"
55,3,5,"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away."
55,3,6,"For of this sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with various lusts,"
55,3,7,"Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
55,3,8,"Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith."
55,3,9,"But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was."
55,3,10,"But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,"
55,3,11,"Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me."
55,3,12,"Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
55,3,13,"But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived."
55,3,14,"But continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing of whom you have learned them;"
55,3,15,"And that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."
55,3,16,"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:"
55,3,17,"That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works."
55,4,1,"I charge you therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;"
55,4,2,"Preach the word; be diligent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine."
55,4,3,"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they draw to themselves teachers, having itching ears;"
55,4,4,"And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto myths."
55,4,5,"But you watch in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fully carry out your ministry."
55,4,6,"For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand."
55,4,7,"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:"
55,4,8,"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing."
55,4,9,"Do your diligence to come shortly unto me:"
55,4,10,"For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia."
55,4,11,"Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry."
55,4,12,"And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus."
55,4,13,"The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when you come, bring with you, and the books, but especially the parchments."
55,4,14,"Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:"
55,4,15,"Of whom you beware also; for he has greatly withstood our words."
55,4,16,"At my first defense no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge."
55,4,17,"However the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion."
55,4,18,"And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen."
55,4,19,"Greet Priscilla and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus."
55,4,20,"Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletus sick."
55,4,21,"Do your diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren."
55,4,22,"The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen."
56,1,1,"Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;"
56,1,2,"In hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages began;"
56,1,3,"But has in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Savior;"
56,1,4,"To Titus, my own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior."
56,1,5,"For this cause I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:"
56,1,6,"If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of rebellion or unruly."
56,1,7,"For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, not violent, not given to dishonest gain;"
56,1,8,"But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good, sensible, just, holy, temperate;"
56,1,9,"Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to refute the opposition."
56,1,10,"For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially they of the circumcision:"
56,1,11,"Whose mouths must be stopped, who ruin whole households, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain."
56,1,12,"One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
56,1,13,"This witness is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;"
56,1,14,"Not giving heed to Jewish myths, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth."
56,1,15,"Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled."
56,1,16,"They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate."
56,2,1,"But you speak the things which become sound doctrine:"
56,2,2,"That the aged men be sensible, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience."
56,2,3,"The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;"
56,2,4,"That they may teach the young women to be sensible, to love their husbands, to love their children,"
56,2,5,"To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed."
56,2,6,"Young men likewise exhort to be sensible."
56,2,7,"In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing incorruptness, gravity, sincerity,"
56,2,8,"Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is an opponent may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you."
56,2,9,"Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not talking back;"
56,2,10,"Not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things."
56,2,11,"For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,"
56,2,12,"Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live sensibly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;"
56,2,13,"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ;"
56,2,14,"Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own, zealous of good works."
56,2,15,"These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise you."
56,3,1,"Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,"
56,3,2,"To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness unto all men."
56,3,3,"For we ourselves also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another."
56,3,4,"But after the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared,"
56,3,5,"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit;"
56,3,6,"Whom he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior;"
56,3,7,"That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
56,3,8,"This is a faithful saying, and these things I desire that you affirm constantly, that they who have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men."
56,3,9,"But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain."
56,3,10,"A man that is divisive after the first and second admonition reject;"
56,3,11,"Knowing that he that is such is perverted, and sins, being condemned of himself."
56,3,12,"When I shall send Artemas unto you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter."
56,3,13,"Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be lacking unto them."
56,3,14,"And let our own also learn to maintain good works for urgent needs, that they not be unfruitful."
56,3,15,"All that are with me greet you. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen."
57,1,1,"Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,"
57,1,2,"And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:"
57,1,3,"Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
57,1,4,"I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,"
57,1,5,"Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;"
57,1,6,"That the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus."
57,1,7,"For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints are refreshed by you, brother."
57,1,8,"Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you that which is required,"
57,1,9,"Yet for love's sake I rather beseech you, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ."
57,1,10,"I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:"
57,1,11,"Who in time past was to you unprofitable, but now profitable to you and to me:"
57,1,12,"Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, my own heart:"
57,1,13,"Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:"
57,1,14,"But without your consent would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly."
57,1,15,"For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him forever;"
57,1,16,"Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more unto you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?"
57,1,17,"If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself."
57,1,18,"If he has wronged you, or owes you anything, put that on my account;"
57,1,19,"I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: nevertheless I do not say to you how you owe me even your own self besides."
57,1,20,"Yea, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my heart in the Lord."
57,1,21,"Having confidence in your obedience I wrote unto you, knowing that you will also do more than I say."
57,1,22,"At the same time prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you."
57,1,23,"There greet you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;"
57,1,24,"Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers."
57,1,25,"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen."
58,1,1,"God, who at many times and in various manners spoke in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,"
58,1,2,"Has in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;"
58,1,3,"Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;"
58,1,4,"Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they."
58,1,5,"For unto which of the angels said he at any time,"
58,1,6,"And again, when he brings the firstbegotten into the world, he says,"
58,1,7,"And of the angels he says,"
58,1,8,"But unto the Son he says,"
58,1,9,""
58,1,10,""
58,1,11,""
58,1,12,""
58,1,13,"But to which of the angels said he at any time,"
58,1,14,"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to them who shall be heirs of salvation?"
58,2,1,"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip."
58,2,2,"For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;"
58,2,3,"How shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;"
58,2,4,"God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?"
58,2,5,"For unto the angels has he not put in subjection the world to come, of which we speak."
58,2,6,"But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man, that you visit him?"
58,2,7,"You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:"
58,2,8,"You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him."
58,2,9,"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man."
58,2,10,"For it befitted him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
58,2,11,"For both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,"
58,2,12,"Saying,"
58,2,13,"And again,"
58,2,14,"Since then the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;"
58,2,15,"And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."
58,2,16,"For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the nature of Abraham."
58,2,17,"Therefore in all things he had to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people."
58,2,18,"For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help them that are tempted."
58,3,1,"Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;"
58,3,2,"Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house."
58,3,3,"For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who has built the house has more honor than the house."
58,3,4,"For every house is built by some man; but he that built all things is God."
58,3,5,"And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;"
58,3,6,"But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end."
58,3,7,"Therefore (as the Holy Spirit says,"
58,3,8,""
58,3,9,""
58,3,10,""
58,3,11,""
58,3,12,"Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God."
58,3,13,"But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."
58,3,14,"For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end;"
58,3,15,"While it is said,"
58,3,16,"For some, when they had heard, did provoke: yet not all that came out of Egypt by Moses."
58,3,17,"But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?"
58,3,18,"And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?"
58,3,19,"So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief."
58,4,1,"Let us therefore fear, lest, although a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it."
58,4,2,"For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it."
58,4,3,"For we who have believed do enter into rest, as he said,"
58,4,4,"For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day in this way, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works."
58,4,5,"And in this place again,"
58,4,6,"Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter into it, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:"
58,4,7,"Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David,"
58,4,8,"For if Joshua had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day."
58,4,9,"There remains therefore a rest to the people of God."
58,4,10,"For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his."
58,4,11,"Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief."
58,4,12,"For the word of God is living, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
58,4,13,"Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
58,4,14,"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession."
58,4,15,"For we have not a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses; but was in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin."
58,4,16,"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."
58,5,1,"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:"
58,5,2,"Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are wayward; for he himself also is beset with weakness."
58,5,3,"And for this reason he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins."
58,5,4,"And no man takes this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron."
58,5,5,"So also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest; but he that said unto him,"
58,5,6,"As he says also in another place,"
58,5,7,"Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;"
58,5,8,"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;"
58,5,9,"And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;"
58,5,10,"Called of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek."
58,5,11,"Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to explain, seeing you are dull of hearing."
58,5,12,"For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food."
58,5,13,"For every one that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe."
58,5,14,"But solid food belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil."
58,6,1,"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto maturity; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,"
58,6,2,"Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment."
58,6,3,"And this will we do, if God permits."
58,6,4,"For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,"
58,6,5,"And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,"
58,6,6,"If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame."
58,6,7,"For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth plants fit for them by whom it is cultivated, receives blessing from God:"
58,6,8,"But that which bears thorns and briars is worthless, and is near unto cursing; whose end is to be burned."
58,6,9,"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak."
58,6,10,"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister."
58,6,11,"And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:"
58,6,12,"That you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
58,6,13,"For when God made a promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,"
58,6,14,"Saying,"
58,6,15,"And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise."
58,6,16,"For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife."
58,6,17,"So God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:"
58,6,18,"That by two immutable things, in that it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:"
58,6,19,"Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil;"
58,6,20,"Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."
58,7,1,"For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;"
58,7,2,"To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;"
58,7,3,"Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abides a priest continually."
58,7,4,"Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils."
58,7,5,"And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they are descendants of Abraham:"
58,7,6,"But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises."
58,7,7,"And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better."
58,7,8,"And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives."
58,7,9,"And as I may so say, Levi also, who receives tithes, paid tithes in Abraham."
58,7,10,"For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him."
58,7,11,"If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?"
58,7,12,"For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law."
58,7,13,"For he of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, of which no man has ever served at the altar."
58,7,14,"For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood."
58,7,15,"And it is yet far more evident: that after the similitude of Melchizedek there arises another priest,"
58,7,16,"Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life."
58,7,17,"For he testifies,"
58,7,18,"For there is verily an annulment of the previous commandment because of the weakness and uselessness thereof."
58,7,19,"For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by which we draw near unto God."
58,7,20,"And since it was not without an oath he was made priest:"
58,7,21,"(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him,"
58,7,22,"By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better covenant."
58,7,23,"And they truly were many priests, because they were not allowed to continue by reason of death:"
58,7,24,"But this man, because he continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood."
58,7,25,"Therefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them."
58,7,26,"For such a high priest was befitting for us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;"
58,7,27,"Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself."
58,7,28,"For the law makes men high priests who have weakness; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, makes the Son, who is consecrated forevermore."
58,8,1,"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;"
58,8,2,"A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."
58,8,3,"For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: therefore it is of necessity that this man have something also to offer."
58,8,4,"For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:"
58,8,5,"Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, says he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount."
58,8,6,"But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises."
58,8,7,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second."
58,8,8,"For finding fault with them, he says,"
58,8,9,""
58,8,10,""
58,8,11,""
58,8,12,""
58,8,13,"In that he says, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and grows old is ready to vanish away."
58,9,1,"Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and an earthly sanctuary."
58,9,2,"For there was a tabernacle made; the first, in which was the lampstand, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the sanctuary."
58,9,3,"And behind the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;"
58,9,4,"Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, in which was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;"
58,9,5,"And over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy seat; of which we cannot now speak particularly."
58,9,6,"Now when these things were thus prepared, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God."
58,9,7,"But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:"
58,9,8,"The Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while the first tabernacle was yet standing:"
58,9,9,"Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;"
58,9,10,"Which stood only in foods and drinks, and various washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation."
58,9,11,"But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;"
58,9,12,"Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us."
58,9,13,"For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh:"
58,9,14,"How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
58,9,15,"And for this cause he is the mediator of the new covenant, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they who are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."
58,9,16,"For where a will is, there must also of necessity be the death of the maker."
58,9,17,"For a will is in force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the maker lives."
58,9,18,"Hence neither the first covenant was dedicated without blood."
58,9,19,"For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,"
58,9,20,"Saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded unto you."
58,9,21,"Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry."
58,9,22,"And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission."
58,9,23,"It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."
58,9,24,"For Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:"
58,9,25,"Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place every year with blood of others;"
58,9,26,"For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the age has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself."
58,9,27,"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"
58,9,28,"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation."
58,10,1,"For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the ones approaching perfect."
58,10,2,"For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshipers once purged should have had no more consciousness of sins."
58,10,3,"But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year."
58,10,4,"For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins."
58,10,5,"Therefore when he comes into the world, he says,"
58,10,6,""
58,10,7,""
58,10,8,"Above when he said,"
58,10,9,"Then said he,"
58,10,10,"By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."
58,10,11,"And every priest stands daily ministering and offering frequently the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:"
58,10,12,"But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;"
58,10,13,"From then on waiting till his enemies be made his footstool."
58,10,14,"For by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified."
58,10,15,"The Holy Spirit also is a witness to us: for after this he had said before,"
58,10,16,""
58,10,17,""
58,10,18,"Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin."
58,10,19,"Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,"
58,10,20,"By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;"
58,10,21,"And having a high priest over the house of God;"
58,10,22,"Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water."
58,10,23,"Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)"
58,10,24,"And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:"
58,10,25,"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching."
58,10,26,"For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,"
58,10,27,"But a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."
58,10,28,"He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:"
58,10,29,"Of how much worse punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done insult unto the Spirit of grace?"
58,10,30,"For we know him that has said,"
58,10,31,"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
58,10,32,"But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight with afflictions;"
58,10,33,"Partly, while you were made a public display both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, while you became companions of them that were so used."
58,10,34,"For you had compassion on me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring possession."
58,10,35,"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward."
58,10,36,"For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise."
58,10,37,""
58,10,38,""
58,10,39,"But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul."
58,11,1,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
58,11,2,"For by it the elders obtained approval."
58,11,3,"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."
58,11,4,"By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaks."
58,11,5,"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God."
58,11,6,"But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
58,11,7,"By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved by fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."
58,11,8,"By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should later receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing where he went."
58,11,9,"By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:"
58,11,10,"For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God."
58,11,11,"Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised."
58,11,12,"Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the seashore innumerable."
58,11,13,"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth."
58,11,14,"For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country."
58,11,15,"And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from which they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned."
58,11,16,"But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly: therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he has prepared for them a city."
58,11,17,"By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son."
58,11,18,"Of whom it was said,"
58,11,19,"Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from which also he received him in a figure."
58,11,20,"By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come."
58,11,21,"By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshiped, leaning upon the top of his staff."
58,11,22,"By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones."
58,11,23,"By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment."
58,11,24,"By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;"
58,11,25,"Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time;"
58,11,26,"Esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he looked for the recompense of the reward."
58,11,27,"By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible."
58,11,28,"Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them."
58,11,29,"By faith they passed through the Red sea as on dry land: which the Egyptians attempting to do were drowned."
58,11,30,"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were encircled seven days."
58,11,31,"By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace."
58,11,32,"And what shall I say more? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:"
58,11,33,"Who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,"
58,11,34,"Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in war, turned to flight the armies of foreigners."
58,11,35,"Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:"
58,11,36,"And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:"
58,11,37,"They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;"
58,11,38,"(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth."
58,11,39,"And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:"
58,11,40,"God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."
58,12,1,"Therefore seeing we also are surrounded with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily ensnare us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,"
58,12,2,"Looking unto Jesus the author and perfecter of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God."
58,12,3,"For consider him that endured such hostility of sinners against himself, lest you be wearied and faint in your minds."
58,12,4,"You have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin."
58,12,5,"And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks unto you as unto children, My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of him:"
58,12,6,"For whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives."
58,12,7,"If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chastens not?"
58,12,8,"But if you be without chastisement, of which all are partakers, then are you illegitimate children, and not sons."
58,12,9,"Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?"
58,12,10,"For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness."
58,12,11,"Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them who are trained by it."
58,12,12,"Therefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;"
58,12,13,"And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed."
58,12,14,"Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:"
58,12,15,"Looking diligently lest any man fall short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;"
58,12,16,"Lest there be any immoral, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright."
58,12,17,"For you know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears."
58,12,18,"For you are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,"
58,12,19,"And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:"
58,12,20,"(For they could not endure that which was commanded,"
58,12,21,"And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)"
58,12,22,"But you are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,"
58,12,23,"To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, who are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,"
58,12,24,"And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things than that of Abel."
58,12,25,"See that you refuse not him that speaks. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke on earth, much more shall we not escape, if we turn away from him that speaks from heaven:"
58,12,26,"Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying,"
58,12,27,"And this word,"
58,12,28,"Therefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:"
58,12,29,"For our God is a consuming fire."
58,13,1,"Let brotherly love continue."
58,13,2,"Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares."
58,13,3,"Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them who suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body."
58,13,4,"Let marriage be held in honor by all, and the bed undefiled: but fornicators and adulterers God will judge."
58,13,5,"Let your conduct be without covetousness; and be content with such things as you have: for he has said,"
58,13,6,"So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me."
58,13,7,"Remember them who have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their manner of life."
58,13,8,"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever."
58,13,9,"Be not carried about with various and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with foods, which have not profited them that have been observing them."
58,13,10,"We have an altar, of which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle."
58,13,11,"For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp."
58,13,12,"Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered outside the gate."
58,13,13,"Let us go forth therefore unto him outside the camp, bearing his reproach."
58,13,14,"For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come."
58,13,15,"By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name."
58,13,16,"But to do good and to share forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."
58,13,17,"Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you."
58,13,18,"Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly."
58,13,19,"But I beseech you rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner."
58,13,20,"Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,"
58,13,21,"Make you complete in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen."
58,13,22,"And I beseech you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words."
58,13,23,"Know that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you."
58,13,24,"Greet all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy greet you."
58,13,25,"Grace be with you all. Amen."
59,1,1,"James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting."
59,1,2,"My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials;"
59,1,3,"Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience."
59,1,4,"But let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing."
59,1,5,"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all men liberally, and reproaches not; and it shall be given him."
59,1,6,"But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed."
59,1,7,"For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord."
59,1,8,"A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways."
59,1,9,"Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:"
59,1,10,"But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away."
59,1,11,"For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withers the grass, and its flower falls, and the beauty of the appearance of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways."
59,1,12,"Blessed is the man that endures trial: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him."
59,1,13,"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:"
59,1,14,"But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed."
59,1,15,"Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death."
59,1,16,"Do not err, my beloved brethren."
59,1,17,"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."
59,1,18,"Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures."
59,1,19,"Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger:"
59,1,20,"For the anger of man works not the righteousness of God."
59,1,21,"Therefore put away all filthiness and extreme wickedness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls."
59,1,22,"But be you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."
59,1,23,"For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:"
59,1,24,"For he beholds himself, and goes his way, and immediately forgets what manner of man he was."
59,1,25,"But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues in it, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."
59,1,26,"If any man among you seems to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain."
59,1,27,"Pure religion and undefiled before God the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."
59,2,1,"My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons."
59,2,2,"For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in fine apparel, and there come in also a poor man in shabby clothing;"
59,2,3,"And you have respect to him that wears the fine clothing, and say unto him, Sit here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand there, or sit here under my footstool:"
59,2,4,"Are you not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?"
59,2,5,"Hearken, my beloved brethren, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?"
59,2,6,"But you have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judges?"
59,2,7,"Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by which you are called?"
59,2,8,"If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture,"
59,2,9,"But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convicted of the law as transgressors."
59,2,10,"For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."
59,2,11,"For he that said,"
59,2,12,"So speak, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."
59,2,13,"For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy triumphs over judgment."
59,2,14,"What does it profit, my brethren, though a man says he has faith, and has not works? can faith save him?"
59,2,15,"If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,"
59,2,16,"And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be warmed and filled; yet you give them not those things which are needful to the body; what does it profit?"
59,2,17,"Even so faith, if it has not works, is dead, being alone."
59,2,18,"Yea, a man may say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
59,2,19,"You believe that there is one God; you do well: the demons also believe, and tremble."
59,2,20,"But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?"
59,2,21,"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?"
59,2,22,"See how faith worked with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?"
59,2,23,"And the scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God."
59,2,24,"You see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only."
59,2,25,"Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?"
59,2,26,"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
59,3,1,"My brethren, be not many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the severer judgment."
59,3,2,"For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body."
59,3,3,"Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body."
59,3,4,"Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven by fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires."
59,3,5,"Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how great a forest a little fire kindles!"
59,3,6,"And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell."
59,3,7,"For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind:"
59,3,8,"But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."
59,3,9,"With this bless we God, even the Father; and with this curse we men, who are made after the similitude of God."
59,3,10,"Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be."
59,3,11,"Does a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?"
59,3,12,"Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh."
59,3,13,"Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good life his works with meekness of wisdom."
59,3,14,"But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, boast not, and lie not against the truth."
59,3,15,"This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic."
59,3,16,"For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work."
59,3,17,"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy."
59,3,18,"And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by them that make peace."
59,4,1,"From where come wars and fightings among you? come they not from here, even of your lusts that war in your members?"
59,4,2,"You lust, and have not: you kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: you fight and war, yet you have not, because you ask not."
59,4,3,"You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it upon your lusts."
59,4,4,"You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God."
59,4,5,"Do you think that the scripture says in vain, The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy?"
59,4,6,"But he gives more grace. Therefore he says,"
59,4,7,"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
59,4,8,"Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded."
59,4,9,"Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness."
59,4,10,"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up."
59,4,11,"Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaks evil of his brother, and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law, and judges the law: but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge."
59,4,12,"There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who are you that judge another?"
59,4,13,"Come now, you that say, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:"
59,4,14,"Whereas you know not what shall be tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away."
59,4,15,"For you ought to say, If the Lord wills, we shall live, and do this, or that."
59,4,16,"But now you rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil."
59,4,17,"Therefore to him that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin."
59,5,1,"Come now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you."
59,5,2,"Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten."
59,5,3,"Your gold and silver is rusted; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as if it were fire. You have heaped treasure together for the last days."
59,5,4,"Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cries: and the cries of them who have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts."
59,5,5,"You have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; you have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter."
59,5,6,"You have condemned and killed the just; and he does not resist you."
59,5,7,"Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receives the early and latter rain."
59,5,8,"Be also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draws near."
59,5,9,"Murmur not one against another, brethren, lest you be judged: behold, the judge stands before the door."
59,5,10,"Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience."
59,5,11,"Behold, we count them happy who endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very compassionate, and of tender mercy."
59,5,12,"But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest you fall under judgment."
59,5,13,"Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms."
59,5,14,"Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:"
59,5,15,"And the prayer of faith shall deliver the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he has committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."
59,5,16,"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much."
59,5,17,"Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months."
59,5,18,"And he prayed again, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth brought forth its fruit."
59,5,19,"Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;"
59,5,20,"Let him know, that he who converts the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins."
60,1,1,"Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the exiles scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"
60,1,2,"Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied."
60,1,3,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,"
60,1,4,"To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,"
60,1,5,"Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."
60,1,6,"In which you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold trials:"
60,1,7,"That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:"
60,1,8,"Whom having not seen, you love; in whom, though now you see him not, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:"
60,1,9,"Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."
60,1,10,"Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:"
60,1,11,"Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when he testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow."
60,1,12,"Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into."
60,1,13,"Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;"
60,1,14,"As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:"
60,1,15,"But as he who has called you is holy, so be holy in all manner of conduct;"
60,1,16,"Because it is written,"
60,1,17,"And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to every man's work, pass the time of your exile here in fear:"
60,1,18,"Since you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain manner of life received by tradition from your fathers;"
60,1,19,"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:"
60,1,20,"Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,"
60,1,21,"Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God."
60,1,22,"Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto sincere love of the brethren, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:"
60,1,23,"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and abides forever."
60,1,24,"For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower thereof falls away:"
60,1,25,"But the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you."
60,2,1,"Therefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speaking,"
60,2,2,"As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:"
60,2,3,"If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious."
60,2,4,"To whom coming, as unto a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,"
60,2,5,"You also, as living stones, are built up into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."
60,2,6,"Therefore also it is contained in the scripture,"
60,2,7,"Unto you therefore who believe he is precious: but unto them who are disobedient, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner,"
60,2,8,"And,"
60,2,9,"But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:"
60,2,10,"Who in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy."
60,2,11,"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as aliens and exiles, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;"
60,2,12,"Having your conduct honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation."
60,2,13,"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;"
60,2,14,"Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well."
60,2,15,"For so is the will of God, that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:"
60,2,16,"As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God."
60,2,17,"Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king."
60,2,18,"Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh."
60,2,19,"For this is commendable, if a man for conscience toward God endures grief, suffering wrongfully."
60,2,20,"For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is commendable with God."
60,2,21,"For even to this were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:"
60,2,22,"Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:"
60,2,23,"Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:"
60,2,24,"Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed."
60,2,25,"For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls."
60,3,1,"Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conduct of the wives;"
60,3,2,"While they behold your chaste behavior coupled with fear."
60,3,3,"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;"
60,3,4,"But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price."
60,3,5,"For after this manner in former times the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:"
60,3,6,"Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid with any terror."
60,3,7,"Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered."
60,3,8,"Finally, be all of one mind, having compassion one with another, love as brethren, be tender hearted, be courteous:"
60,3,9,"Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but on the contrary blessing; knowing that you are unto this called, that you should inherit a blessing."
60,3,10,"For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:"
60,3,11,"Let him turn away from evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it."
60,3,12,"For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil."
60,3,13,"And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?"
60,3,14,"But if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and,"
60,3,15,"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:"
60,3,16,"Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good behavior in Christ."
60,3,17,"For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing."
60,3,18,"For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit:"
60,3,19,"By whom also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;"
60,3,20,"Who formerly were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, by which a few, that is, eight souls were saved through water."
60,3,21,"The like figure unto which even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:"
60,3,22,"Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him."
60,4,1,"Since therefore Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;"
60,4,2,"That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God."
60,4,3,"For the time past of our life will suffice us to have done the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in licentiousness, lusts, excess of wine, reveling, carousing, and abominable idolatries:"
60,4,4,"In which they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of dissipation, speaking evil of you:"
60,4,5,"Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead."
60,4,6,"For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."
60,4,7,"But the end of all things is at hand: be therefore sober minded, and watch unto prayer."
60,4,8,"And above all things have fervent love among yourselves: for love shall cover a multitude of sins."
60,4,9,"Practice hospitality one to another without grudging."
60,4,10,"As every man has received a gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."
60,4,11,"If any man speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man ministers, let him do it as of the ability which God gives: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever. Amen."
60,4,12,"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to test you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:"
60,4,13,"But rejoice, since you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy."
60,4,14,"If you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you; for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified."
60,4,15,"But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters."
60,4,16,"Yet if any man suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf."
60,4,17,"For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begins with us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?"
60,4,18,"And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"
60,4,19,"Therefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator."
60,5,1,"The elders who are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:"
60,5,2,"Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for dishonest gain, but of a ready mind;"
60,5,3,"Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock."
60,5,4,"And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away."
60,5,5,"Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for"
60,5,6,"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:"
60,5,7,"Casting all your care upon him; for he cares for you."
60,5,8,"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:"
60,5,9,"Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world."
60,5,10,"But the God of all grace, who has called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, restore, establish, strengthen, settle you."
60,5,11,"To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."
60,5,12,"By Silas, a faithful brother unto you, as I regard, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand."
60,5,13,"The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, greets you; and so does Mark my son."
60,5,14,"Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen."
61,1,1,"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:"
61,1,2,"Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,"
61,1,3,"According as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who has called us to glory and virtue:"
61,1,4,"By which are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
61,1,5,"And for this reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;"
61,1,6,"And to knowledge self control; and to self control patience; and to patience godliness;"
61,1,7,"And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness love."
61,1,8,"For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
61,1,9,"But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins."
61,1,10,"Therefore rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:"
61,1,11,"For so an entrance shall be provided unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
61,1,12,"Therefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and are established in the present truth."
61,1,13,"Yea, I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;"
61,1,14,"Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me."
61,1,15,"Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my departure to have these things always in remembrance."
61,1,16,"For we have not followed cunningly devised myths, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty."
61,1,17,"For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory,"
61,1,18,"And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount."
61,1,19,"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; to which you do well that you take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:"
61,1,20,"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of oneâ€™s own interpretation."
61,1,21,"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit."
61,2,1,"But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who shall secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction."
61,2,2,"And many shall follow their shameful ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of."
61,2,3,"And through covetousness shall they with false words exploit you: whose judgment of old now lingers not, and their destruction slumbers not."
61,2,4,"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;"
61,2,5,"And spared not the ancient world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;"
61,2,6,"And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them by a catastrophe, making them an example unto those that later should live ungodly;"
61,2,7,"And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy behavior of the wicked:"
61,2,8,"(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)"
61,2,9,"The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:"
61,2,10,"But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise authority. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of the glorious ones."
61,2,11,"Whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord."
61,2,12,"But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;"
61,2,13,"And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to revel in the daytime. Spots they are and blemishes, reveling themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;"
61,2,14,"Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: a heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:"
61,2,15,"Who have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;"
61,2,16,"But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb donkey speaking with man's voice restrained the madness of the prophet."
61,2,17,"These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved forever."
61,2,18,"For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that have just escaped from them who live in error."
61,2,19,"While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage."
61,2,20,"For if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning."
61,2,21,"For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them."
61,2,22,"But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog has turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire."
61,3,1,"This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both of which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:"
61,3,2,"That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:"
61,3,3,"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,"
61,3,4,"And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."
61,3,5,"For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:"
61,3,6,"By which the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:"
61,3,7,"But the heavens and the earth, which now are, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men."
61,3,8,"But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
61,3,9,"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
61,3,10,"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up."
61,3,11,"Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conduct and godliness,"
61,3,12,"Looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?"
61,3,13,"Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, in which dwells righteousness."
61,3,14,"Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless."
61,3,15,"And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him has written unto you;"
61,3,16,"As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable twist, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction."
61,3,17,"You therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things beforehand, beware lest you also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness."
61,3,18,"But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen."
62,1,1,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;"
62,1,2,"(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)"
62,1,3,"That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."
62,1,4,"And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."
62,1,5,"This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
62,1,6,"If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:"
62,1,7,"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin."
62,1,8,"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
62,1,9,"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
62,1,10,"If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."
62,2,1,"My little children, these things write I unto you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:"
62,2,2,"And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world."
62,2,3,"And by this we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments."
62,2,4,"He that says, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
62,2,5,"But whoever keeps his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: by this we know that we are in him."
62,2,6,"He that says he abides in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked."
62,2,7,"Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning."
62,2,8,"Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines."
62,2,9,"He that says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now."
62,2,10,"He that loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him."
62,2,11,"But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes."
62,2,12,"I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake."
62,2,13,"I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because you have known the Father."
62,2,14,"I have written unto you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one."
62,2,15,"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him."
62,2,16,"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world."
62,2,17,"And the world passes away, and the lust thereof: but he that does the will of God abides forever."
62,2,18,"Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; by which we know that it is the last time."
62,2,19,"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."
62,2,20,"But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things."
62,2,21,"I have not written unto you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth."
62,2,22,"Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son."
62,2,23,"Whosoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father:"
62,2,24,"Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father."
62,2,25,"And this is the promise that he has promised us, even eternal life."
62,2,26,"These things have I written unto you concerning them that deceive you."
62,2,27,"But the anointing which you have received of him abides in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him."
62,2,28,"And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming."
62,2,29,"If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone that does righteousness is born of him."
62,3,1,"Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the children of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not."
62,3,2,"Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."
62,3,3,"And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure."
62,3,4,"Whosoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law."
62,3,5,"And you know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin."
62,3,6,"Whosoever abides in him sins not: whosoever sins has not seen him, neither known him."
62,3,7,"Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous."
62,3,8,"He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil."
62,3,9,"Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his nature remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God."
62,3,10,"In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother."
62,3,11,"For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another."
62,3,12,"Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."
62,3,13,"Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hates you."
62,3,14,"We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loves not his brother abides in death."
62,3,15,"Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him."
62,3,16,"By this perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."
62,3,17,"But whoever has this world's goods, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his heart of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?"
62,3,18,"My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth."
62,3,19,"And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him."
62,3,20,"For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things."
62,3,21,"Beloved, if our heart condemns us not, then have we confidence toward God."
62,3,22,"And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight."
62,3,23,"And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment."
62,3,24,"And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us."
62,4,1,"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but test the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world."
62,4,2,"By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:"
62,4,3,"And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, of which you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world."
62,4,4,"You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."
62,4,5,"They are of the world: therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them."
62,4,6,"We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error."
62,4,7,"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and everyone that loves is born of God, and knows God."
62,4,8,"He that loves not knows not God; for God is love."
62,4,9,"In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him."
62,4,10,"In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins."
62,4,11,"Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."
62,4,12,"No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us."
62,4,13,"By this we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit."
62,4,14,"And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world."
62,4,15,"Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him, and he in God."
62,4,16,"And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him."
62,4,17,"In this is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world."
62,4,18,"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear: because fear has to do with punishment. He that fears is not made perfect in love."
62,4,19,"We love him, because he first loved us."
62,4,20,"If a man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?"
62,4,21,"And this commandment have we from him, That he who loves God love his brother also."
62,5,1,"Whosoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and everyone that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him."
62,5,2,"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments."
62,5,3,"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not burdensome."
62,5,4,"For whoever is born of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith."
62,5,5,"Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"
62,5,6,"This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth."
62,5,7,"For there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one."
62,5,8,"And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one."
62,5,9,"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son."
62,5,10,"He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself: he that believes not God has made him a liar; because he believes not the witness that God gave of his Son."
62,5,11,"And this is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son."
62,5,12,"He that has the Son has life; and he that has not the Son of God has not life."
62,5,13,"These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God."
62,5,14,"And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us:"
62,5,15,"And if we know that he hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we desired of him."
62,5,16,"If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it."
62,5,17,"All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death."
62,5,18,"We know that whosoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not."
62,5,19,"And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness."
62,5,20,"And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life."
62,5,21,"Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen."
63,1,1,"The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;"
63,1,2,"For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us forever."
63,1,3,"Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love."
63,1,4,"I rejoiced greatly that I found some of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father."
63,1,5,"And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another."
63,1,6,"And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it."
63,1,7,"For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist."
63,1,8,"Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have worked for, but that we receive a full reward."
63,1,9,"Whoever goes beyond, and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son."
63,1,10,"If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:"
63,1,11,"For he that bids him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds."
63,1,12,"Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full."
63,1,13,"The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen."
64,1,1,"The elder unto the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth."
64,1,2,"Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers."
64,1,3,"For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth."
64,1,4,"I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth."
64,1,5,"Beloved, you do faithfully whatsoever you do for the brethren, and for strangers;"
64,1,6,"Who have borne witness of your love before the church: whom if you send forward on their journey in a godly manner, you shall do well:"
64,1,7,"Because for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles."
64,1,8,"We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellow helpers to the truth."
64,1,9,"I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, receives us not."
64,1,10,"Therefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, speaking against us with malicious words: and not content with that, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church."
64,1,11,"Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God: but he that does evil has not seen God."
64,1,12,"Demetrius has good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear witness; and you know that our witness is true."
64,1,13,"I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto you:"
64,1,14,"But I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name."
65,1,1,"Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:"
65,1,2,"Mercy unto you, and peace and love, be multiplied."
65,1,3,"Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was necessary for me to write unto you, and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints."
65,1,4,"For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into licentiousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ."
65,1,5,"I will therefore put you in remembrance, though you once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not."
65,1,6,"And the angels who kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."
65,1,7,"Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after unnatural lust, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire."
65,1,8,"Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise authority, and speak evil of the glorious ones."
65,1,9,"Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil as he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you."
65,1,10,"But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves."
65,1,11,"Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the rebellion of Korah."
65,1,12,"These are spots in your love feasts, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about by winds; trees whose fruit withers, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;"
65,1,13,"Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever."
65,1,14,"And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his saints,"
65,1,15,"To execute judgment upon all, and to convict all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
65,1,16,"These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling words, holding men in admiration for the sake of advantage."
65,1,17,"But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;"
65,1,18,"How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts."
65,1,19,"These are they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit."
65,1,20,"But you, beloved, building up yourselves in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,"
65,1,21,"Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life."
65,1,22,"And on some have compassion, making a difference:"
65,1,23,"And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh."
65,1,24,"Now unto him who is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,"
65,1,25,"To the only wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen."
66,1,1,"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and revealed it by his angel unto his servant John:"
66,1,2,"Who bore witness of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw."
66,1,3,"Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand."
66,1,4,"John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;"
66,1,5,"And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loves us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,"
66,1,6,"And has made us a kingdom and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."
66,1,7,"Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also who pierced him: and all tribes of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen."

66,1,9,"I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ."
66,1,10,"I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,"
66,1,11,"Saying,"
66,1,12,"And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden lampstands;"
66,1,13,"And in the midst of the seven lampstands one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girded about the breast with a golden belt."
66,1,14,"His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;"
66,1,15,"And his feet like unto fine bronze, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters."
66,1,16,"And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in its strength."
66,1,17,"And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me,"

66,4,1,"After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said,"
66,4,2,"And immediately I was in the spirit; and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne."
66,4,3,"And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a carnelian stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in appearance like unto an emerald."
66,4,4,"And round about the throne were four and twenty thrones: and upon the thrones I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white clothing; and they had on their heads crowns of gold."
66,4,5,"And out of the throne proceeded lightning and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God."
66,4,6,"And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind."
66,4,7,"And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had a face as a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle."
66,4,8,"And the four living creatures had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come."
66,4,9,"And when those living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him that sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,"
66,4,10,"The four and twenty elders fall down before him that is sitting on the throne, and worship him that lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,"
66,4,11,"You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created."
66,5,1,"And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals."
66,5,2,"And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll, and to loose the seals thereof?"
66,5,3,"And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the scroll, neither to look thereon."
66,5,4,"And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the scroll, neither to look thereon."
66,5,5,"And one of the elders said unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll, and to loose the seven seals thereof."
66,5,6,"And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth."
66,5,7,"And he came and took the scroll out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne."
66,5,8,"And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of saints."
66,5,9,"And they sang a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open the seals thereof: for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;"
66,5,10,"And have made us unto our God a kingdom and priests: and we shall reign on the earth."
66,5,11,"And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;"
66,5,12,"Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing."
66,5,13,"And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever."
66,5,14,"And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that lives forever and ever."
66,6,1,"And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four living creatures saying, Come and see."
66,6,2,"And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer."
66,6,3,"And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, Come and see."
66,6,4,"And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword."
66,6,5,"And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on it had a pair of balances in his hand."
66,6,6,"And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see you hurt not the oil and the wine."
66,6,7,"And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, Come and see."
66,6,8,"And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on it was Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the living creatures of the earth."
66,6,9,"And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:"
66,6,10,"And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"
66,6,11,"And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little while, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled."
66,6,12,"And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;"
66,6,13,"And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casts its unripe figs, when it is shaken by a mighty wind."
66,6,14,"And the heavens departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
66,6,15,"And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the generals, and the mighty men, and every slave, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;"
66,6,16,"And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:"
66,6,17,"For the great day of his wrath has come; and who shall be able to stand?"
66,7,1,"And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree."
66,7,2,"And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,"
66,7,3,"Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."
66,7,4,"And I heard the number of them who were sealed: and there were sealed a hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel."
66,7,5,"Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,6,"Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,7,"Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,8,"Of the tribe of Zebulun were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand."
66,7,9,"After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and tribes, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;"
66,7,10,"And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne, and unto the Lamb."
66,7,11,"And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four living creatures, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshiped God,"
66,7,12,"Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God forever and ever. Amen."
66,7,13,"And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, Who are these who are arrayed in white robes? and from where did they come?"
66,7,14,"And I said unto him, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they who came out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
66,7,15,"Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sits on the throne shall dwell among them."
66,7,16,"They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun strike them, nor any heat."
66,7,17,"For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."
66,8,1,"And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."
66,8,2,"And I saw the seven angels who stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets."
66,8,3,"And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne."
66,8,4,"And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand."
66,8,5,"And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake."
66,8,6,"And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound."
66,8,7,"The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up."
66,8,8,"And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;"
66,8,9,"And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed."
66,8,10,"And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;"
66,8,11,"And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter."
66,8,12,"And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shined not for a third part of it, and the night likewise."
66,8,13,"And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through midheaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!"
66,9,1,"And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit."
66,9,2,"And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit."
66,9,3,"And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power."
66,9,4,"And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men who have not the seal of God in their foreheads."
66,9,5,"And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a man."
66,9,6,"And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them."
66,9,7,"And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men."
66,9,8,"And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions."
66,9,9,"And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle."
66,9,10,"And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months."
66,9,11,"And they had a king over them, who is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue he has the name Apollyon."
66,9,12,"One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more after these."
66,9,13,"And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,"
66,9,14,"Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet,"
66,9,15,"And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, to slay the third part of men."
66,9,16,"And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them."
66,9,17,"And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone."
66,9,18,"By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths."
66,9,19,"For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, with heads, and with them they do hurt."
66,9,20,"And the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, and silver, and bronze, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:"
66,9,21,"Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts."
66,10,1,"And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:"
66,10,2,"And he had in his hand a little scroll open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,"
66,10,3,"And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices."
66,10,4,"And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not."
66,10,5,"And the angel whom I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,"
66,10,6,"And swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that are therein, and the earth, and the things that are therein, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:"
66,10,7,"But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his servants the prophets."
66,10,8,"And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke unto me again, and said,"
66,10,9,"And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little scroll. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make your stomach bitter, but it shall be in your mouth sweet as honey."
66,10,10,"And I took the little scroll out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my stomach was bitter."
66,10,11,"And he said unto me, you must prophesy again about many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings."
66,11,1,"And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein."
66,11,2,"But the court which is outside the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months."
66,11,3,"And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed in sackcloth."
66,11,4,"These are the two olive trees, and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth."
66,11,5,"And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed."
66,11,6,"These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will."
66,11,7,"And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them."
66,11,8,"And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified."
66,11,9,"And they of the people and tribes and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not allow their dead bodies to be put in graves."
66,11,10,"And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth."
66,11,11,"And after three days and a half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them who saw them."
66,11,12,"And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up here. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them."
66,11,13,"And the same hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the rest were frightened, and gave glory to the God of heaven."
66,11,14,"The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe comes quickly."
66,11,15,"And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign forever and ever."
66,11,16,"And the four and twenty elders, who sat before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshiped God,"
66,11,17,"Saying, We give you thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who is, and was, and is to come; because you have taken to you your great power, and have reigned."
66,11,18,"And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should give reward unto your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great; and should destroy them who destroy the earth."
66,11,19,"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail."
66,12,1,"And there appeared a great sign in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:"
66,12,2,"And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered."
66,12,3,"And there appeared another sign in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads."
66,12,4,"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered, to devour her child as soon as it was born."
66,12,5,"And she brought forth a male child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne."
66,12,6,"And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days."
66,12,7,"And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,"
66,12,8,"And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven."
66,12,9,"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."
66,12,10,"And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night."
66,12,11,"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto death."
66,12,12,"Therefore rejoice, you heavens, and you that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! for the devil has come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has but a short time."
66,12,13,"And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the male child."
66,12,14,"And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent."
66,12,15,"And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood."
66,12,16,"And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth."
66,12,17,"And the dragon was angry with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."
66,13,1,"And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy."
66,13,2,"And the beast that I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority."
66,13,3,"And I saw one of his heads as if it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world marveled after the beast."
66,13,4,"And they worshiped the dragon who gave power unto the beast: and they worshiped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?"
66,13,5,"And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months."
66,13,6,"And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven."
66,13,7,"And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all tribes, and tongues, and nations."
66,13,8,"And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
66,13,9,"If any man has an ear, let him hear."
66,13,10,"He that leads into captivity shall go into captivity: he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints."
66,13,11,"And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon."
66,13,12,"And he exercises all the power of the first beast before him, and causes the earth and them who dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed."
66,13,13,"And he does great wonders, so that he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,"
66,13,14,"And deceives them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, that had the wound by a sword, and did live."
66,13,15,"And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."
66,13,16,"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:"
66,13,17,"And that no man might buy or sell, except he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
66,13,18,"Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred three score and six."
66,14,1,"And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads."
66,14,2,"And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:"
66,14,3,"And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who were redeemed from the earth."
66,14,4,"These are they who were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb."
66,14,5,"And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God."
66,14,6,"And I saw another angel fly in midheaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,"
66,14,7,"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment has come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."
66,14,8,"And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."
66,14,9,"And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,"
66,14,10,"The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out undiluted into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:"
66,14,11,"And the smoke of their torment ascends up forever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receives the mark of his name."
66,14,12,"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
66,14,13,"And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me,"
66,14,14,"And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle."
66,14,15,"And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in your sickle, and reap: for the time has come for you to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe."
66,14,16,"And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped."
66,14,17,"And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle."
66,14,18,"And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe."
66,14,19,"And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God."
66,14,20,"And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horsesâ€™ bridles, for a thousand and six hundred furlongs."
66,15,1,"And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is completed the wrath of God."
66,15,2,"And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God."
66,15,3,"And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are your ways, you King of saints."
66,15,4,"Who shall not fear you, O Lord, and glorify your name? for you only are holy: for all nations shall come and worship before you; for your judgments are made manifest."
66,15,5,"And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:"
66,15,6,"And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden sashes."
66,15,7,"And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever."
66,15,8,"And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled."
66,16,1,"And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels,"
66,16,2,"And the first went, and poured out his bowl upon the earth; and there fell foul and evil sores upon the men who had the mark of the beast, and upon them who worshiped his image."
66,16,3,"And the second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man; and every living thing died in the sea."
66,16,4,"And the third angel poured out his bowl upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood."
66,16,5,"And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, who is, and was, and shall be, because you have judged thus."
66,16,6,"For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink; for they are deserving of it."
66,16,7,"And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments."
66,16,8,"And the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun; and power was given unto it to scorch men with fire."
66,16,9,"And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, who has power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory."
66,16,10,"And the fifth angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,"
66,16,11,"And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds."
66,16,12,"And the sixth angel poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared."
66,16,13,"And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet."
66,16,14,"For they are the spirits of demons, working miracles, who go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty."
66,16,15,""
66,16,16,"And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon."
66,16,17,"And the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying,"
66,16,18,"And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great."
66,16,19,"And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath."
66,16,20,"And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found."
66,16,21,"And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceedingly great."
66,17,1,"And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come here; I will show unto you the judgment of the great harlot that sits upon many waters:"
66,17,2,"With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication."
66,17,3,"So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns."
66,17,4,"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:"
66,17,5,"And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
66,17,6,"And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great wonder."
66,17,7,"And the angel said unto me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns."
66,17,8,"The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is."
66,17,9,"And here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits."
66,17,10,"And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short time."
66,17,11,"And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition."
66,17,12,"And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast."
66,17,13,"These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast."
66,17,14,"These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful."
66,17,15,"And he said unto me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues."
66,17,16,"And the ten horns which you saw upon the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire."
66,17,17,"For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled."
66,17,18,"And the woman whom you saw is that great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth."
66,18,1,"And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was made bright with his glory."
66,18,2,"And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of demons, and the haunt of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird."
66,18,3,"For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich through the abundance of her luxury."
66,18,4,"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying,"
66,18,5,"For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities."
66,18,6,"Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she has filled, fill to her double."
66,18,7,"So much as she has glorified herself, and lived luxuriously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow."
66,18,8,"Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judges her."
66,18,9,"And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived in luxury with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,"
66,18,10,"Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is your judgment come."
66,18,11,"And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buys their merchandise any more:"
66,18,12,"The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all citron wood, and all manner of vessels of ivory, and all manner of vessels of most precious wood, and of bronze, and iron, and marble,"
66,18,13,"And cinnamon, and incense, and myrrh, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men."
66,18,14,"And the fruits that your soul lusted after are departed from you, and all things which were luxurious and splendid are departed from you, and you shall find them no more at all."
66,18,15,"The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,"
66,18,16,"And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!"
66,18,17,"For in one hour such great riches is come to nothing. And every shipmaster, and all seafarers, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,"
66,18,18,"And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!"
66,18,19,"And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, in which were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her wealth! for in one hour is she made desolate."
66,18,20,"Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets; for God has avenged you on her."
66,18,21,"And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all."
66,18,22,"And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of flutists, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in you; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he may be, shall be found any more in you; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in you;"
66,18,23,"And the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in you; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in you: for your merchants were the great men of the earth; for by your sorceries were all nations deceived."
66,18,24,"And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth."
66,19,1,"And after these things I heard a great voice of many people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God:"
66,19,2,"For true and righteous are his judgments: for he has judged the great harlot, who did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand."
66,19,3,"And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up forever and ever."
66,19,4,"And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia."
66,19,5,"And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all you his servants, and you that fear him, both small and great."
66,19,6,"And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigns."
66,19,7,"Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready."
66,19,8,"And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of saints."
66,19,9,"And he said unto me, Write, Blessed are they who are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me, These are the true sayings of God."
66,19,10,"And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
66,19,11,"And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon it was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he does judge and make war."
66,19,12,"His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself."
66,19,13,"And he was clothed with a robe dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God."
66,19,14,"And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean."
66,19,15,"And out of his mouth goes forth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God."
66,19,16,"And he has on his robe and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."
66,19,17,"And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in midheaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;"
66,19,18,"That you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great."
66,19,19,"And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army."
66,19,20,"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that worked miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshiped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."
66,19,21,"And the rest were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh."
66,20,1,"And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand."
66,20,2,"And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, who is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,"
66,20,3,"And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little while."
66,20,4,"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years."
66,20,5,"But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection."
66,20,6,"Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years."
66,20,7,"And when the thousand years are ended, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,"
66,20,8,"And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea."
66,20,9,"And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and encircled the camp of the saints, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."
66,20,10,"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever."
66,20,11,"And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them."
66,20,12,"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works."
66,20,13,"And the sea gave up the dead who were in it; and death and hades delivered up the dead who were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works."
66,20,14,"And death and hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."
66,20,15,"And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."
66,21,1,"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea."
66,21,2,"And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."
66,21,3,"And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God."
66,21,4,"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."
66,21,5,"And he that sat upon the throne said,"
66,21,6,"And he said unto me,"

66,21,8,""
66,21,9,"And there came unto me one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife."
66,21,10,"And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,"
66,21,11,"Having the glory of God: and its radiance was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;"
66,21,12,"And having a wall great and high, and having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:"
66,21,13,"On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates."
66,21,14,"And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
66,21,15,"And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof."
66,21,16,"And the city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal."
66,21,17,"And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel."
66,21,18,"And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass."
66,21,19,"And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;"
66,21,20,"The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, carnelian; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprase; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst."
66,21,21,"And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: each of the gates was a single pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass."
66,21,22,"And I saw no temple in it: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it."
66,21,23,"And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God is its light, and the Lamb is its lamp."
66,21,24,"And the nations of them who are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it."
66,21,25,"And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there."
66,21,26,"And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it."
66,21,27,"And there shall in no way enter into it anything that defiles, neither whatsoever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they who are written in the Lamb's book of life."
66,22,1,"And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb."
66,22,2,"In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bore twelve manner of fruit, and yielded its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."

66,22,4,"And they shall see his face; and his name shall be on their foreheads."
66,22,5,"And there shall be no night there; and they need no lamp, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign forever and ever."
66,22,6,"And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done."
66,22,7,""
66,22,8,"And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things."
66,22,9,"Then he said unto me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of them who keep the words of this book: worship God."
66,22,10,"And he said unto me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand."
66,22,11,"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still."
