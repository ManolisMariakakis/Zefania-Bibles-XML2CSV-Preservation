1,31,42,"Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the"
1,31,43,"Then Laban answered, and saide vnto Iaakob, These daughters are my daughters, & these sonnes are my sonnes, and these sheepe are my sheepe, and all that thou seest, is mine, and what can I doe this day vnto these my daughters, or to their sonnes which they haue borne?"
1,31,44,"Now therefore"
1,31,45,"Then tooke Iaakob a stone, and set it vp as a pillar:"
1,31,46,"And Iaakob sayde vnto his brethren, Gather stones: who brought stones, and made an heape, and they did eate there vpon the heape."
1,31,47,"And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it"
1,31,48,"For Laban sayd, This heape is witnesse betweene me and thee this day: therefore he called the name of it Galeed."
1,31,49,"And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD"
1,31,50,"If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take [other]"
1,31,51,"Moreouer Laban sayd to Iaakob, Beholde this heape, and behold the pillar, which I haue set betweene me and thee,"
1,31,52,"This heape shall be witnesse, and the pillar shall be witnesse, that I will not come ouer this heape to thee, and that thou shalt not passe ouer this heape and this pillar vnto me for euill."
1,31,53,"The God of Abraham, and the God of"
1,31,54,"Then Iaakob did offer a sacrifice vpon the mount, and called his brethren to eate bread; they did eate bread, and taried all night in the mount."
1,31,55,"And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and"
1,32,1,"Nowe Iaakob went forth on his iourney and the Angels of God met him."
1,32,2,"And when Jacob saw them, he said,"
1,32,3,"Then Iaakob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, vnto the land of Seir into the countrey of Edom:"
1,32,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my"
1,32,5,"I haue beeues also and Asses, sheepe, & men seruantes, and women seruantes, and haue sent to shew my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight."
1,32,6,"So ye messengers came againe to Iaakob, saying, We came vnto thy brother Esau, and hee also commeth against thee and foure hundreth men with him."
1,32,7,"Then Jacob was"
1,32,8,"For he said, If Esau come to ye one copanie and smite it, the other companie shall escape."
1,32,9,"Moreouer Iaakob said, O God of my father Abraham, & God of my father Izhak: Lord, which saydest vnto me, Returne vnto thy coutrey and to thy kinred, and I will do thee good,"
1,32,10,"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my"
1,32,11,"Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, [and] the"
1,32,12,"For thou saydest; I will surely doe thee good, and make thy seede as the sande of the sea, which can not be nombred for multitude."
1,32,13,"And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a"
1,32,14,"Two hundreth shee goates & twenty hee goates, two hundreth ewes & twentie rammes:"
1,32,15,"Thirtie mylche camels with their coltes, fourtie kine, and ten bullockes, twentie she asses and ten foles."
1,32,16,"So he deliuered them into the hande of his seruants, euery droue by themselues, and saide vnto his seruants, Passe before me, & put a space betweene droue and droue."
1,32,17,"And he commanded the formost, saying, If Esau my brother meete thee, and aske thee, saying, Whose seruant art thou? And whither goest thou? And whose are these before thee?"
1,32,18,"Then thou shalt say, They be thy seruant Iaakobs: it is a present sent vnto my lord Esau: and beholde, he him selfe also is behinde vs."
1,32,19,"So likewise commaunded he the seconde and the thirde, and all that followed the droues, saying, After this maner, ye shall speake vnto Esau, when ye finde him."
1,32,20,"And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, I"
1,32,21,"So went the present before him: but he taried that night with the companie."
1,32,22,"And he rose vp the same night, and tooke his two wiues, and his two maides, and his eleuen children, and went ouer the forde Iabbok."
1,32,23,"And he tooke them, and sent them ouer the riuer, and sent ouer that he had."
1,32,24,"And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a"
1,32,25,"And when he saw that he"
1,32,26,"And he saide, Let me goe, for the morning appeareth. Who answered, I will not let thee go except thou blesse me."
1,32,27,"Then said he vnto him, What is thy name? And he said, Iaakob."
1,32,28,"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou"
1,32,29,"Then Iaakob demaded, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name; he said, Wherefore now doest thou aske my name? & he blessed him there"
1,32,30,"And Iaakob called the name of the place, Peniel: for, saide he, I haue seene God face to face, and my life is preserued."
1,32,31,"And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he"
1,32,32,"Therefore the children of Israel eate not of the sinewe that shranke in the hollowe of the thigh, vnto this day: because he touched the sinew that shranke in the holow of Iaakobs thigh."
1,33,1,"And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he"
1,33,2,"And he put the maides, and their children formost, and Leah, and her children after, and Rahel, and Ioseph hindermost."
1,33,3,"And he passed over before them, and"
1,33,4,"Then Esau ranne to meete him, and embraced him, and fell on his necke, and kissed him, & they wept."
1,33,5,"And he lift vp his eyes, and sawe the women, and the children, and saide, Who are these with thee? And he answered, They are ye childre whome God of his grace hath giuen thy seruant."
1,33,6,"Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they"
1,33,7,"Leah also with her children came nere and made obeysance: and after Ioseph & Rahel drew neere, and did reuerence."
1,33,8,"Then he said, What meanest thou by all this droue, which I met? Who answered, I haue sent it, that I may finde fauour in the sight of my lorde:"
1,33,9,"And Esau said, I haue ynough, my brother: keepe that thou hast to thy selfe."
1,33,10,"And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore"
1,33,11,"I pray thee take my blessing, that is brought thee: for God hath had mercie on me, and therefore I haue all things: so he compelled him, and he tooke it."
1,33,12,"And he saide, Let vs take our iourney and go, and I will goe before thee."
1,33,13,"Then he answered him, My lord knoweth, that the children are tender, & the ewes & kine with yong vnder mine hande: and if they should ouerdriue them one day, all the flocke would die."
1,33,14,"Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until"
1,33,15,"Then Esau said, I will leaue then some of my folke with thee; he answered, what needeth this? let me finde grace in the sight of my lorde."
1,33,16,"So Esau returned, and went his way that same day vnto Seir."
1,33,17,"And Iaakob went forwarde towarde Succoth, and built him an house, & made boothes for his cattell: therefore he called the name of the place Succoth."
1,33,18,"Afterward, Iaakob came safe to Sheche a citie, which is in the lande of Canaan, when he came from Padan Aram, and pitched before the citie."
1,33,19,"And there he bought a parcell of ground, where hee pitched his tent, at the hande of the sonnes of Hamor Shechems father, for an hundreth pieces of money."
1,33,20,"And he erected there an altar, and called"
1,34,1,"And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,"
1,34,2,"Whome when Shechem the sonne of Hamor the Hiuite lorde of that countrey sawe, hee tooke her, and lay with her, and defiled her."
1,34,3,"So his heart claue vnto Dinah the daughter of Iaakob: and he loued the maide, & spake kindely vnto the maide."
1,34,4,"And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying,"
1,34,5,"(Nowe Iaakob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, and his sonnes were with his cattell in the fielde: therefore Iaakob helde his peace, vntill they were come.)"
1,34,6,"Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out vnto Iaakob to commune with him."
1,34,7,"And whe the sonnes of Iaakob were come out of the fielde and heard it, it grieued the men, & they were very angry, because he had wrought villenie in Israel, in that he had lyen with Iaakobs daughter: which thing ought not to be done."
1,34,8,"And Hamor communed with them, saying, the soule of my sonne Shechem longeth for your daughter: giue her him to wife, I pray you."
1,34,9,"So make affinitie with vs: giue your daughters vnto vs, and take our daughters vnto you,"
1,34,10,"And ye shall dwell with vs, and the lande shalbe before you: dwell, and doe your businesse in it, and haue your possessions therein."
1,34,11,"Shechem also said vnto her father & vnto her brethren, Let me finde fauour in your eyes, and I will giue whatsoeuer ye shall appoint me."
1,34,12,"Aske of me abundantly both dowrie and giftes, and I will giue as ye appoint me, so that ye giue me the maide to wife."
1,34,13,"Then the sonnes of Iaakob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, talking deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,"
1,34,14,"And they said unto them,"
1,34,15,"But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we [be], that every male of you be"
1,34,16,"Then will we giue our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to vs, and will dwell with you, and be one people."
1,34,17,"But if ye will not hearken vnto vs to be circumcised, then will we take our daughter and depart."
1,34,18,"Nowe their wordes pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamors sonne."
1,34,19,"And the yong man deferd not to doe the thing because he loued Iaakobs daughter: he was also the most set by of all his fathers house."
1,34,20,"And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the"
1,34,21,"These men [are]"
1,34,22,"Onely herein will the men consent vnto vs for to dwell with vs, and to be one people, if all the men children among vs be circumcised as they are circumcised."
1,34,23,"[Shall] not"
1,34,24,"And vnto Hamor, and Shechem his sonne hearkened all that went out of the gate of his citie: and all the men children were circumcised, euen all that went out of the gate of his citie."
1,34,25,"And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob,"
1,34,26,"They slewe also Hamor and Shechem his sonne with the edge of the sword, & tooke Dinah out of Shechems house, and went their way."
1,34,27,"Againe the other sonnes of Iaakob came vpon the dead, and spoyled the citie, because they had defiled their sister."
1,34,28,"They tooke their sheepe & their beeues, and their asses, and whatsoeuer was in the citie, and in the fieldes."
1,34,29,"Also they caryed away captiue & spoyled all their goods, and all their children and their wiues, and all that was in the houses."
1,34,30,"Then Iaakob said to Simeon and Leui, Ye haue troubled me, and made me stinke among the inhabitats of the land, aswell the Canaanites, as the Perizzites, and and I being few in nomber, they shall gather theselues together against me, & slay me, and so shall I, and my house be destroied."
1,34,31,"And they answered, Shoulde hee abuse our sister as a whore?"
1,35,1,"And"
1,35,2,"Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that [were] with him, Put away the strange gods that [are] among you, and be"
1,35,3,"For we will rise and goe vp to Beth-el, and I will make an altar there vnto God, which heard me in the day of my tribulation, and was with me in the way which I went."
1,35,4,"And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which [were] in their hand, and [all their]"
1,35,5,"And they journeyed: and the"
1,35,6,"So came Iaakob to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan: (the same is Beth-el) hee and all the people that was with him."
1,35,7,"And he built there an altar, and had called the place, The God of Beth-el, because that God appeared vnto him there, when he fled from his brother."
1,35,8,"Then Deborah Rebekahs nourse dyed, and was buried beneath Beth-el vnder an oke: and he called the name of it Allon Bachuth."
1,35,9,"Againe God appeared vnto Iaakob, after he came out of Padan Aram, and blessed him."
1,35,10,"Moreouer God said vnto him, Thy name is Iaakob: thy name shalbe no more called Iaakob, but Israel shalbe thy name: and hee called his name Israel."
1,35,11,"Againe God said vnto him, I am God all sufficient. growe, and multiplie. a nation and a multitude of nations shall spring of thee, and Kings shall come out of thy loynes."
1,35,12,"Also I will giue the lande, which I gaue to Abraham and Izhak, vnto thee: and vnto thy seede after thee will I giue that land."
1,35,13,"And God"
1,35,14,"And Iaakob set vp a pillar in the place where he talked with him, a pillar of stone, and powred drinke offring thereon: also hee powred oyle thereon."
1,35,15,"And Iaakob called the name of the place, where God spake with him, Beth-el."
1,35,16,"And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a"
1,35,17,"And whe she was in paines of her labour, the midwife saide vnto her, Feare not: for thou shalt haue this sonne also."
1,35,18,"Then as she was about to yeelde vp the Ghost (for she died) she called his name Ben-oni, but his father called him Beniamin."
1,35,19,"Thus died Rahel, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem."
1,35,20,"And Jacob set a"
1,35,21,"Then Israel went forwarde, and pitched his tent beyond Migdal-eder."
1,35,22,"And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and"

1,35,24,"The sonnes of Rahel: Ioseph & Beniamin."
1,35,25,"And the sonnes of Bilhah Rahels maide: Dan and Naphtali."
1,35,26,"And the sonnes of Zilpah Leahs maide: Gad and Asher. These are the sonnes of Iaakob, which were borne him in Padan Aram."
1,35,27,"Then Iaakob came vnto Izhak his father to Mamre a citie of Arbah: this is Hebron, where Abraham and Izhak were strangers."
1,35,28,"And the daies of Izhak were an hundreth and fourescore yeeres."
1,35,29,"And Izhak gaue vp the ghost and died, and was gathered vnto his people, being olde & full of daies: & his sonnes Esau & Iaakob buried him."
1,36,1,"Now these [are]"
1,36,2,"Esau took his wives of the"

1,36,4,"And Adah bare vnto Esau, Eliphaz: and Basemath bare Reuel."
1,36,5,"Also Aholibamah bare Ieush, and Iaalam, and Korah: these are the sonnes of Esau which were borne to him in the land of Canaan."
1,36,6,"And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and"
1,36,7,"For their riches were so great, that they could not dwell together, and the lande, wherein they were strangers, coulde not receiue them because of their flockes."
1,36,8,"Therefore dwelt Esau in mount Seir: this Esau is Edom."
1,36,9,"So these are the generations of Esau father of Edom in mount Seir."
1,36,10,"These are the names of Esaus sonnes: Eliphaz, the sonne of Adah, the wife of Esau, & Reuel the sonne of Bashemath, the wife of Esau."

1,36,34,"When Iobab also was dead, Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his steade."
1,36,35,"And after the death of Husham, Hadad the sonne of Bedad, which slewe Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his steade, and the name of his citie was Auith."

1,38,5,"Moreouer she bare yet a sonne, whome she called Shelah: and Iudah was at Chezib when she bare him."
1,38,6,"Then Iudah tooke a wife to Er his first borne sonne whose name was Tamar."
1,38,7,"Now Er the first borne of Iudah was wicked in the sight of the Lord: therefore the Lord slewe him."
1,38,8,"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise"
1,38,9,"And Onan knewe that the seede should not be his: therefore when he went in vnto his brothers wife, he spilled it on the grounde, least he should giue seede vnto his brother."
1,38,10,"And it was wicked in the eyes of the Lord, which he did: wherefore he slewe him also."
1,38,11,"Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law,"
1,38,12,"And in processe of time also the daughter of Shuah Iudahs wife dyed. Then Iudah, when he had left mourning, went vp to his sheepe sherers to Timnah, he, and his neighbour Hirah the Adullamite."
1,38,13,"And it was tolde Tamar, saying, beholde, thy father in lawe goeth vp to Timnah, to shere his sheepe."
1,38,14,"Then she put her widowes garments off from her, and couered her with a vaile, and wrapped her selfe, and sate downe in Pethah-enaim, which is by the way to Timnah, because she sawe that Shelah was growen, and she was not giuen vnto him to wife."
1,38,15,"When Iudah sawe her, he iudged her an whore: for she had couered her face."
1,38,16,"And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he"
1,38,17,"Then said he, I will sende thee a kid of the goates from the flocke; she said, Well, if thou wilt giue me a pledge, till thou sende it."
1,38,18,"Then he saide, What is the pledge that I shall giue thee? And she answered, Thy signet, and thy cloke, and thy staffe that is in thine hande. So he gaue it her, and lay by her, and she was with childe by him."
1,38,19,"Then she rose, and went and put her vaile from her and put on her widowes raiment."
1,38,20,"And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his"
1,38,21,"Then asked he the men of that place, saying, Where is ye whore, that sate in Enaim by the way side? And they answered, There was no whore here."
1,38,22,"He came therefore to Iudah againe, and said, I can not finde her, and also the men of the place said, There was no whore there."
1,38,23,"And Judah said, Let her take [it] to her, lest we be"
1,38,24,"And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she [is] with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be"
1,38,25,"When she was brought foorth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, vnto whom these things pertaine, am I with childe: and saide also, Looke, I pray thee, whose these are, the seale, and the cloke, and the staffe."
1,38,26,"And Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She hath been"
1,38,27,"Now, when the time was come that she should be deliuered, beholde, there were twinnes in her wombe."
1,38,28,"And when she was in trauell, the one put out his hand: and the midwife tooke and bound a red threde about his hand, saying, This is come out first."
1,38,29,"And it came to pass, as he"
1,38,30,"And afterward came out his brother that had the red threde about his hande, and his name was called Zarah."
1,39,1,"And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an"
1,39,2,"And the"
1,39,3,"And his master sawe that the Lorde was with him, and that the Lorde made all that hee did to prosper in his hande."
1,39,4,"And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him"
1,39,5,"And it came to pass from the time [that] he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD"
1,39,6,"And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand;"
1,39,7,"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said,"
1,39,8,"But he refused and said to his masters wife, Beholde, my master knoweth not what he hath in the house with me, but hath committed all that he hath to mine hande."
1,39,9,"[There is] none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou [art] his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against"
1,39,10,"And albeit she spake to Ioseph day by day, yet he hearkened not vnto her, to lye with her, or to be in her company."
1,39,11,"Then on a certaine day Ioseph entred into the house, to doe his businesse: and there was no man of the houshold in the house:"
1,39,12,"Therefore she caught him by his garmet, saying, Sleepe with me: but he left his garment in her hand and fled, and got him out."
1,39,13,"Nowe when she sawe that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled out,"
1,39,14,"That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I"
1,39,15,"And when he heard that I lift vp my voice and cryed, he left his garment with me, and fled away, and got him out."
1,39,16,"So she layde vp his garment by her, vntill her lord came home."
1,39,17,"Then she tolde him according to these words, saying, The Ebrew seruat, which thou hast brought vnto vs, came in to me, to mocke me."
1,39,18,"But assoone as I lift vp my voyce & cried, he left his garment with me, and fled out."
1,39,19,"Then when his master heard the wordes of his wife, which she tolde him, saying, After this maner did thy seruant to me, his anger was kindled."
1,39,20,"And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the"
1,39,21,"But the Lorde was with Ioseph, and shewed him mercie, and got him fauour in the sight of the master of the prison."
1,39,22,"And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that [were] in the prison; and"
1,39,23,"And the keeper of the prison looked vnto nothing that was vnder his hande, seeing that the Lord was with him: for whatsoeuer he did, the Lorde made it to prosper."
1,40,1,"And after these things, the butler of the King of Egypt and his baker offended their lorde the King of Egypt."
1,40,2,"And Pharaoh was angrie against his two officers, against the chiefe butler, and against the chiefe baker."
1,40,3,"And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where"
1,40,4,"And the chiefe steward gaue Ioseph charge ouer them, and he serued them: and they continued a season in warde."
1,40,5,"And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night,"
1,40,6,"And when Ioseph came in vnto them in the morning, and looked vpon them, beholde, they were sad."
1,40,7,"And he asked Pharaohs officers, that were with him in his masters warde, saying, Wherefore looke ye so sadly to day?"
1,40,8,"And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and [there is] no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them,"
1,40,9,"So the chiefe butler tolde his dreame to Ioseph, and said vnto him, In my dreame, behold, a vine was before me,"
1,40,10,"And in the vine were three branches, and as it budded, her flowre came foorth: and the clusters of grapes waxed ripe."
1,40,11,"And I had Pharaohs cup in mine hande, and I tooke the grapes, & wrung the into Pharaohs cup, and I gaue the cup into Pharaohs hand."
1,40,12,"And Joseph said unto him, This"
1,40,13,"Within three dayes shall Pharaoh lift vp thine head, & restore thee vnto thine office, and thou shalt giue Pharaohs cup into his hand after the olde maner, when thou wast his butler."
1,40,14,"But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and"
1,40,15,"For I was stollen away by theft out of the land of the Ebrewes, and here also haue I done nothing, wherefore they should put mee in the dungeon."
1,40,16,"When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also [was] in my dream, and, behold, [I had] three"
1,40,17,"And in the vppermost basket there was of all maner baken meates for Pharaoh: and the birdes did eate them out of the basket vpon mine head."
1,40,18,"And Joseph answered and said,"
1,40,19,"Within three dayes shall Pharaoh take thine head from thee, & shal hang thee on a tree, and the birdes shall eate thy flesh from off thee."
1,40,20,"And it came to pass the third day, [which was] Pharaoh's"
1,40,21,"And he restored the chiefe butler vnto his butlershippe, who gaue the cup into Pharaohs hande,"
1,40,22,"But he hanged the chiefe baker, as Ioseph had interpreted vnto them."
1,40,23,"Yet the chiefe butler did not remember Ioseph, but forgate him."
1,41,1,"And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh"
1,41,2,"And loe, there came out of the riuer seuen goodly kine and fatfleshed, and they fedde in a medowe:"
1,41,3,"And loe, seuen other kine came vp after the out of the riuer, euill fauoured & leane fleshed, and stoode by the other kine vpon the brinke of the riuer."
1,41,4,"And the euilfauoured and leane fleshed kine did eate vp the seuen welfauoured and fatte kine: so Pharaoh awoke."
1,41,5,"And he slept and dreamed the"
1,41,6,"And loe, seuen thinne eares, and blasted with the east winde, sprang vp after them:"
1,41,7,"And the thinne eares deuoured the seuen ranke and full eares. then Pharaoh awaked, and loe, it was a dreame."
1,41,8,"And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was"
1,41,9,"Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I"
1,41,10,"Pharaoh being angrie with his seruantes, put me in ward in the chiefe stewards house, both me and the chiefe baker."
1,41,11,"Then we dreamed a dreame in one night, both I, and he: we dreamed eche man according to the interpretation of his dreame."
1,41,12,"And there was with vs a yong man, an Ebrew, seruant vnto the chiefe steward, whome when we told, he declared our dreames to vs, to euery one he declared according to his dreame."
1,41,13,"And as he declared vnto vs, so it came to passe: for he restored me to mine office, & hanged him."
1,41,14,"Then Pharaoh sent and called"
1,41,15,"Then Pharaoh sayde to Ioseph, I haue dreamed a dreame, and no man can interprete it, and I haue hearde say of thee, that when thou hearest a dreame, thou canst interprete it."
1,41,16,"And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying,"
1,41,17,"And Pharaoh sayde vnto Ioseph, In my dreame, beholde, I stoode by the banke of the riuer:"
1,41,18,"And lo, there came vp out of the riuer seuen fat fleshed, and welfauoured kine, and they fedde in the medowe."
1,41,19,"Also loe, seuen other kine came vp after them, poore and very euilfauoured, and leanefleshed: I neuer sawe the like in all the lande of Egypt, for euilfauoured."
1,41,20,"And the leane and euilfauoured kine did eate vp the first seuen fat kine."
1,41,21,"And when they had eaten them vp, it could not be knowen that they had eaten them, but they were still as euilfauoured, as they were at the beginning: so did I awake."
1,41,22,"Moreouer I sawe in my dreame, and beholde, seuen eares sprang out of one stalke, full and faire."
1,41,23,"And lo, seuen eares, withered, thinne, and blasted with the East winde, sprang vp after them."
1,41,24,"And the thinne eares deuoured the seuen good eares. Nowe I haue tolde the soothsayers, and none can declare it vnto me."
1,41,25,"And Joseph said unto Pharaoh,"
1,41,26,"The seuen good kine are seuen yeres, and the seuen good eares are seuen yeeres: this is one dreame."
1,41,27,"Likewise the seuen thinne and euilfauoured kine, that came out after them, are seuen yeeres: and the seuen emptie eares blasted with the East winde, are seuen yeeres of famine."
1,41,28,"This is the thing which I haue saide vnto Pharaoh, that God hath shewed vnto Pharaoh, what he is about to doe."
1,41,29,"Beholde, there come seuen yeeres of great plentie in all the land of Egypt."
1,41,30,"Againe, there shall arise after them seuen yeeres of famine, so that all the plentie shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land:"
1,41,31,"Neither shall the plentie bee knowen in the land, by reason of this famine that shall come after: for it shalbe exceeding great."
1,41,32,"And therefore the dreame was doubled vnto Pharaoh the second time, because the thing is established by God, & God hasteth to performe it."
1,41,33,"Now therefore let Pharaoh"
1,41,34,"Let Pharaoh make and appoynt officers ouer the lande, and take vp the fift part of the land of Egypt in the seuen plenteous yeeres."
1,41,35,"Also let them gather all the foode of these good yeeres that come, and lay vp corne vnder the hand of Pharaoh for foode, in the cities, and let them keepe it."
1,41,36,"So the foode shall be for the prouision of the lande, against the seuen yeeres of famine, which shalbe in the lande of Egypt, that the land perish not by famine."
1,41,37,"And the saying pleased Pharaoh and all his seruants."
1,41,38,"And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find [such a one] as this [is], a man in whom the"
1,41,39,"The Pharaoh said to Ioseph, For as much as God hath shewed thee all this, there is no man of vnderstanding, or of wisedome like vnto thee."
1,41,40,"Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy"
1,41,41,"Moreouer Pharaoh said to Ioseph, Behold, I haue set thee ouer all the land of Egypt."
1,41,42,"And Pharaoh tooke off his ring from his hand, and put it vpon Iosephs hand, and arayed him in garments of fine linnen, and put a golden cheyne about his necke."
1,41,43,"And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him,"
1,41,44,"Againe Pharaoh saide vnto Ioseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift vp his hand or his foote in all the land of Egypt."
1,41,45,"And Pharaoh called Iosephs name Zaphnath-paaneah: and he gaue him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah prince of On. then went Ioseph abrode in the land of Egypt."
1,41,46,"And Joseph [was]"
1,41,47,"And in the seuen plenteous yeres the earth brought foorth store."
1,41,48,"And hee gathered vp all the foode of the seuen plenteous yeeres, which were in the lande of Egypt, and layde vp foode in the cities: the foode of the fielde, that was round about euery citie, layde he vp in the same."
1,41,49,"So Ioseph gathered wheate, like vnto the sand of the sea in multitude out of measure, vntill he left numbring: for it was without number."
1,41,50,"Now vnto Ioseph were borne two sonnes (before the yeeres of famine came) which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah prince of On bare vnto him."
1,41,51,"And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, [said he], hath made me forget all my toil, and all my"
1,41,52,"Also hee called the name of the second, Ephraim: For God, sayde he hath made me fruitfull in the land of mine affliction."
1,41,53,"So the seuen yeeres of the plentie that was in the land of Egypt were ended."
1,41,54,"Then began the seuen yeeres of famine to come, according as Ioseph had saide: and the famine was in all landes, but in all the land of Egypt was bread."
1,41,55,"At the length all the lande of Egypt was affamished, and the people cryed to Pharaoh for bread; Pharaoh said vnto all the Egyptians, Goe to Ioseph: what he sayth to you, doe ye."
1,41,56,"When the famine was vpon all the land, Ioseph opened all places, wherein the store was, and solde vnto the Egyptians: for the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt."
1,41,57,"And all countries came to Egypt to bye corne of Ioseph, because the famine was sore in all landes."
1,42,1,"Now when"
1,42,2,"And he said, Behold, I haue heard that there is foode in Egypt, Get you downe thither, & bie vs foode thence, that we may liue and not die."
1,42,3,"So went Iosephs ten brethren downe to bye corne of the Egyptians."
1,42,4,"But Beniamin Iosephs brother woulde not Iaakob send with his brethren: for he saide, Least death should befall him."
1,42,5,"And the sonnes of Israel came to bye foode among them that came: for there was famine in the land of Canaan."
1,42,6,"Now Ioseph was gouerner of the land, who solde to all the people of the lande: then Iosephs brethren came, & bowed their face to the groud before him."
1,42,7,"And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but"
1,42,8,"(Now Ioseph knewe his brethren, but they knew not him."
1,42,9,"And Ioseph remembred the dreames, which he dreamed of them) and he sayde vnto them, Ye are spies, and are come to see the weaknesse of the land."
1,42,10,"But they sayde vnto him, Nay, my lorde, but to bye vitayle thy seruants are come."
1,42,11,"Wee are all one mans sonnes: wee meane truely, and thy seruants are no spies."
1,42,12,"But he saide vnto them, Nay, but yee are come to see the weakenes of the land."
1,42,13,"And they said, We thy seruants are twelue brethren, the sonnes of one man in the lande of Canaan: and beholde, the yongest is this day with our father, and one is not."
1,42,14,"Againe Ioseph sayde vnto them, This is it that I spake vnto you, saying, Ye are spies."
1,42,15,"Hereby ye shall be proved:"
1,42,16,"Send one of you which may fet your brother, & ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proued, whether there bee trueth in you: or els by the life of Pharaoh ye are but spies."
1,42,17,"So he put them in warde three dayes."
1,42,18,"And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; [for] I"
1,42,19,"If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bounde in your prison house, and goe ye, carie foode for the famine of your houses:"
1,42,20,"But bring your yonger brother vnto me, that your wordes may be tried, and that ye dye not: and they did so."
1,42,21,"And they said one to another,"
1,42,22,"And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his"
1,42,23,"(And they were not aware that Ioseph vnderstoode them: for he spake vnto them by an interpreter.)"
1,42,24,"And he turned himself about from them, and"
1,42,25,"So Ioseph commanded that they should fill their sackes with wheate, and put euery mans money againe in his sacke, and giue them vitaile for the iourney: and thus did he vnto them."
1,42,26,"And they layed their vitaile vpon their asses, and departed thence."
1,42,27,"And as one of them opened his sacke for to giue his asse prouender in the ynne, he espyed his money: for lo, it was in his sackes mouth."
1,42,28,"And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, [it is] even in my sack: and their heart failed [them], and they were"
1,42,29,"And they came vnto Iaakob their father vnto the lande of Canaan, and tolde him all that had befallen them, saying,"
1,42,30,"The man, who is Lorde of the lande, spake roughly to vs, and put vs in prison as spyes of the countrey."
1,42,31,"And we sayd vnto him, We are true men, and are no spies."
1,42,32,"We be twelue brethren, sonnes of our father: one is not, and the yongest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan."
1,42,33,"Then the Lord of the countrey sayde vnto vs, Hereby shal I knowe if ye be true men: Leaue one of your brethren with me, and take foode for the famine of your houses and depart,"
1,42,34,"And bring your yongest brother vnto me, that I may knowe that ye are no spies, but true men: so will I deliuer you your brother, and yee shall occupie in the land."
1,42,35,"And as they emptied their sacks, behold, euery mans bundel of money was in his sacke: and when they and their father sawe the bundels of their money, they were afrayde."
1,42,36,"And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved [of my children]: Joseph [is] not, and Simeon [is] not, and ye will take Benjamin [away]: all these things are against"
1,42,37,"Then Reuben answered his father, saying, Slay my two sonnes, if I bring him not to thee againe: deliuer him to mine hand, and I will bring him to thee againe."
1,42,38,"But he sayd, My sonne shall not go downe with you: for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if death come vnto him by the way which ye goe, then ye shall bring my gray head with sorow vnto the graue."
1,43,1,"And the"
1,43,2,"And when they had eaten vp the vitaile, which they had brought from Egypt, their father sayd vnto them, Turne againe, and bye vs a little foode."
1,43,3,"And Iudah answered him, saying, The man charged vs by an othe, saying, Neuer see my face, except your brother be with you."
1,43,4,"If thou wilt sende our brother with vs, we will goe downe, and bye thee foode:"
1,43,5,"But if thou wilt not send him, we wil not go downe: for the man said vnto vs, Looke me not in the face, except your brother be with you."
1,43,6,"And Israel sayd, Wherefore delt ye so euill with me, as to tell the man, whether ye had yet a brother or no?"
1,43,7,"And they answered, The man asked straitly of our selues and of our kinred, saying, Is your father yet aliue? haue ye any brother? And wee tolde him according to these wordes: could we knowe certainely that he would say, Bring your brother downe?"
1,43,8,"Then sayde Iudah to Israel his father, Send the boy with mee, that we may rise and goe, and that we may liue and not dye, both we, and thou, and our children."
1,43,9,"I wil be suertie for him: of mine hand shalt thou require him. If I bring him not to thee, and set him before thee, then let me beare the blame for euer."
1,43,10,"For except we had made this tarying, doutlesse by this we had returned the second time."
1,43,11,"Then their father Israel sayd vnto them, If it must needes be so now, do thus: take of the best fruites of the lande in your vessels, and bring the man a present, a little rosen, & a little hony, spices and myrrhe, nuttes, and almondes:"
1,43,12,"And take"
1,43,13,"Take also your brother and arise, and go againe to the man."
1,43,14,"And"
1,43,15,"Thus the men tooke this present, & tooke twise so much money in their hande with Beniamin, and rose vp, and went downe to Egypt and stoode before Ioseph."
1,43,16,"And whe Ioseph saw Beniamin with them, he sayde to his stewarde, Bring these men home and kill meate, and make ready: for the men shal eate with me at noone."
1,43,17,"And the man did as Ioseph bad, & brought the men vnto Iosephs house."
1,43,18,"And the men were"
1,43,19,"Therefore came they to Iosephs stewarde, & communed with him at the doore of ye house."
1,43,20,"And said, Oh syr, we came in deede down hither at the first time to bye foode,"
1,43,21,"And as wee came to an ynne and opened our sackes, behold, euery mans money was in his sackes mouth, euen our money in full weight, but we haue brought it againe in our handes."
1,43,22,"Also other money haue we brought in our handes to bye foode, but we cannot tell, who put our money in our sackes."
1,43,23,"And he said, Peace [be] to you, fear not:"
1,43,24,"So the man led them into Iosephs house, & gaue them water to wash their feete, and gaue their asses prouender."
1,43,25,"And they made ready their present against Ioseph came at noone, (for they heard say, that they should eate bread there)"
1,43,26,"When Ioseph came home, they brought the present into the house to him, which was in their handes, and bowed downe to the grounde before him."
1,43,27,"And he asked them of their prosperitie, and sayd, Is your father the olde man, of whome ye tolde me, in good health? is he yet aliue?"
1,43,28,"Who answered, Thy seruant our father is in good health, he is yet aliue: and they bowed downe, and made obeysance."
1,43,29,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his"
1,43,30,"And Ioseph made haste (for his affection was inflamed towarde his brother, and sought where to weepe) and entred into his chamber, and wept there."
1,43,31,"Afterward he washed his face, & came out, and refrained himselfe, and sayd, Set on meate."
1,43,32,"And they"
1,43,33,"So they sate before him: the eldest according vnto his age, and the yongest according vnto his youth; the men marueiled among themselues."
1,43,34,"And he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank,"
1,44,1,"Afterward he commanded his steward, saying, Fill the mens sackes with foode, as much as they can carry, and put euery mans money in his sackes mouth."
1,44,2,"And"
1,44,3,"And in the morning the men were sent away, they, and their asses."

2,8,28,"And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not"
2,8,29,"And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms [of flies] may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal"
2,8,30,"So Moses went out from Pharaoh & prayed vnto the Lorde."
2,8,31,"And the Lord did according to the saying of Moses, and the swarmes of flies departed from Pharaoh, from his seruants, and from his people, and there remained not one."
2,8,32,"And Pharaoh"
2,9,1,"Then the Lorde said vnto Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lorde God of the Ebrewes, Let my people go, that they may serue me."
2,9,2,"But if thou refuse to let them goe, and wilt yet holde them still,"
2,9,3,"Beholde, the hande of the Lorde is vpon thy flocke which is in the fielde: for vpon the horses, vpon the asses, vpon the camels, vpon the cattell, and vpon the sheepe shalbe a mightie great moraine."
2,9,4,"And the LORD shall"
2,9,5,"And the Lord appointed a time, saying, To morowe the Lorde shall finish this thing in this lande."
2,9,6,"So the Lord did this thing on the morow, and all the cattel of Egypt dyed: but of the cattell of the children of Israel dyed not one."
2,9,7,"And Pharaoh"
2,9,8,"And the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, Take your handfull of ashes of the fornace, and Moses shall sprinkle them towarde the heauen in the sight of Pharaoh,"
2,9,9,"And they shall be turned to dust in all the land of Egypt: and it shalbe as a scab breaking out into blisters vpon man, and vpon beast, thorow out all the land of Egypt."
2,9,10,"Then they tooke ashes of the fornace, and stoode before Pharaoh: and Moses sprinkled them towarde the heauen, and there came a scab breaking out into blisters vpon man, and vpon beast."
2,9,11,"And the sorcerers could not stande before Moses, because of the scab: for the scab was vpon the enchanters, and vpon all the Egyptians."
2,9,12,"And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not vnto them, as the Lorde had said vnto Moses."
2,9,13,"Also the Lorde said vnto Moses, Rise vp early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lorde God of the Ebrewes, Let my people goe, that they may serue me."
2,9,14,"For I will at this time send all my plagues upon"
2,9,15,"For nowe I will stretch out mine hande, that I may smite thee and thy people with the pestilence: and thou shalt perish from the earth."
2,9,16,"And in very deed for this [cause] have I raised thee up, for to shew [in] thee my power; and that my"
2,9,17,"Yet thou exaltest thy selfe against my people, and lettest them not goe."
2,9,18,"Beholde, to morowe this time I will cause to raine a mightie great haile, such as was not in Egypt since the foundation thereof was laid vnto this time."
2,9,19,"Send therefore now, [and]"
2,9,20,"Such then as feared the word of the Lorde among the seruants of Pharaoh, made his seruants and his cattell flee into the houses:"
2,9,21,"And he that regarded not the"
2,9,22,"And the Lorde saide to Moses, Stretche foorth thine hande towarde heauen, that there may be haile in all the land of Egypt, vpon man, and vpon beast, and vpon all the herbes of the fielde in the lande of Egypt."
2,9,23,"Then Moses stretched out his rod towarde heauen, & the Lord sent thunder and haile, and lightening vpon the ground: and the Lorde caused haile to raine vpon the land of Egypt."
2,9,24,"So there was haile, and fire mingled with the haile, so grieuous, as there was none throughout all the lande of Egypt, since it was a nation."
2,9,25,"And the haile smote throughout al ye land of Egypt all that was in the fielde, both man and beast: also ye haile smote all the herbes of ye field, and brake to pieces all the trees of the fielde."
2,9,26,"Onely in the lande of Goshen (where the children of Israel were) was no haile."
2,9,27,"And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I"
2,9,28,"Pray ye vnto the Lorde (for it is ynough) that there be no more mightie thunders and haile, and I will let you goe, and yee shall tarie no longer."
2,9,29,"Then Moses saide vnto him, Assoone as I am out of the citie, I will spreade mine hands vnto the Lorde, and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more haile, that thou mayest knowe that the earth is the Lordes."
2,9,30,"But as for thee and thy servants,"
2,9,31,"(And the flaxe, & the barley were smitten: for the barley was eared, & the flaxe was bolled."
2,9,32,"But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were hid in the grounde)"
2,9,33,"Then Moses went out of the citie from Pharaoh, and spred his hands to the Lorde, and the thunder and the haile ceased, neither rained it vpon the earth."
2,9,34,"And when Pharaoh sawe that the raine and the haile and the thunder were ceased, hee sinned againe, and hardened his heart, both he, and his seruants."
2,9,35,"So the heart of Pharaoh was hardened: neither would he let the children of Israel goe, as the Lord had said by Moses."
2,10,1,"Againe the Lorde saide vnto Moses, Goe to Pharaoh: for I haue hardened his heart, and the heart of his seruants, that I might worke these my miracles in the middes of his realme,"
2,10,2,"And that thou mayest tell in the"
2,10,3,"And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse"
2,10,4,"But if thou refuse to let my people go, beholde, to morowe will I bring grashoppers into thy coastes."
2,10,5,"And they shall couer the face of the earth, that a man can not see the earth: and they shall eate the residue which remaineth vnto you, and hath escaped from the haile: and they shall eate all your trees that bud in the fielde."
2,10,6,"And they shall fil thine houses, and all thy seruants houses, and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers fathers haue seene, since the time they were vpon the earth vnto this day. So he returned, and went out from Pharaoh."
2,10,7,"And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a"
2,10,8,"So Moses and Aaron were brought againe vnto Pharaoh, and he saide vnto them, Goe, serue the Lorde your God, but who are they that shall goe?"
2,10,9,"And Moses answered, We will go with our yong and with our olde, with our sonnes and with our daughters, with our sheepe and with our cattell will we goe: for we must celebrate a feast vnto the Lorde."
2,10,10,"And he said unto them, Let"
2,10,11,"It shall not be so: nowe goe ye that are men, and serue the Lorde: for that was your desire. Then they were thrust out from Pharaohs presence."
2,10,12,"After, the Lord said vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hande vpon the lande of Egypt for the grashoppers, that they may come vpon the lande of Egypt, and eate all the herbes of the land, euen all that the haile hath left."
2,10,13,"Then Moses stretched foorth his rod vpon the lande of Egypt: and the Lorde brought an East winde vpon the land all that day, and al that night: and in the morning the East wind brought the grashoppers."
2,10,14,"So the grashoppers went vp vpon all the land of Egypt, and remained in all quarters of Egypt: so grieuous Grashoppers, like to these were neuer before, neither after them shalbe such."
2,10,15,"For they couered all the face of the earth, so that the lande was darke: and they did eate all the herbes of the lande, and all the fruites of the trees, which the haile had left, so that there was no greene thing left vpon the trees, nor among the herbes of the fielde throughout all the lande of Egypt."
2,10,16,"Then Pharaoh called for"
2,10,17,"And nowe forgiue mee my sinne onely this once, and pray vnto the Lord your God, that hee may take away from me this death onely."
2,10,18,"Moses then went out from Pharaoh, and prayed vnto the Lord."
2,10,19,"And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the"
2,10,20,"But the Lord hardened Pharaohs heart, & hee did not let the children of Israel goe."
2,10,21,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness [which] may be"
2,10,22,"Then Moses stretched forth his hande towarde heauen, and there was a blacke darkenesse in all the land of Egypt three daies."
2,10,23,"No man saw an other, neither rose vp from ye place where he was for three dayes: but all the children of Israel had light where they dwelt."
2,10,24,"The Pharaoh called for Moses & said, Go, serue the Lord: onely your sheepe and your cattel shall abide, and your children shall go with you."
2,10,25,"And Moses sayd, Thou must giue vs also sacrifices, and burnt offrings that wee may doe sacrifice vnto the Lord our God."
2,10,26,"Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an"
2,10,27,"(But the Lorde hardened Pharaohs heart, and he would not let them goe)"
2,10,28,"And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in [that] day thou seest my face thou shalt"
2,10,29,"Then Moses said, Thou hast said wel: from henceforth will I see thy face no more."
2,11,1,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague [more] upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let [you] go, he shall"
2,11,2,"Speake thou nowe to the people, that euery man require of his neighbour, & euery woman of her neighbour iewels of siluer & iewels of gold."
2,11,3,"And the Lorde gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians: also Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaohs seruantes, and in the sight of the people.)"
2,11,4,"Also Moses sayde, Thus sayth the Lord, About midnight will I goe out into the middes of Egypt."
2,11,5,"And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that [is] behind"
2,11,6,"Then there shalbe a great crie throughout all the land of Egypt, such as was neuer none like, nor shalbe."
2,11,7,"But against none of ye children of Israel shal a dogge moue his tongue, neyther against man nor beast, that ye may knowe that the Lord putteth a differece betweene the Egyptians & Israel."
2,11,8,"And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that"
2,11,9,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;"
2,11,10,"So Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: but the Lorde hardened Pharaohs heart, and he suffred not the children of Israel to goe out of his lande."
2,12,1,"Then the Lord spake to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,"
2,12,2,"This"
2,12,3,"Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth [day] of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of [their]"
2,12,4,"And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take [it] according to the number of the souls; every man according to his"
2,12,5,"Your lambe shalbe without blemish, a male of a yeere olde: ye shall take it of the lambes, or of the kiddes."
2,12,6,"And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the"
2,12,7,"After, they shall take of the blood, & strike it on the two postes, and on the vpper doore post of the houses where they shall eate it."
2,12,8,"And they shal eate the flesh the same night, roste with fire, and vnleauened bread: with sowre herbes they shall eate it."
2,12,9,"Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast [with] fire; his"
2,12,10,"And ye shal reserue nothing of it vnto the morning: but that, which remaineth of it vnto the morowe, shall ye burne with fire."
2,12,11,"And thus shall ye eat it; [with] your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste:"
2,12,12,"For I will passe through the lande of Egypt the same night, and will smite all the first borne in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, and I will execute iudgement vpon all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord."
2,12,13,"And the blood shalbe a toke for you vpon the houses where ye are: so when I see the blood, I will passe ouer you, and the plague shall not be vpon you to destruction, when I smite the lande of Egypt."
2,12,14,"And this day shall be unto you for a"
2,12,15,"Seuen daies shall ye eat vnleauened bread, and in any case ye shall put away leauen the first day out of your houses: for whosoeuer eateth leauened bread from the first daie vntill the seuenth day, that person shalbe cut off from Israel."
2,12,16,"And in the first day shalbe an holie assemblie: also in the seuenth day shalbe an holy assemblie vnto you: no worke shalbe done in them, saue about that which euery man must eate: that onely may ye do."
2,12,17,"Ye shall keepe also the feast of vnleauened bread: for that same daye I will bring your armies out of the lande of Egypt: therefore ye shal obserue this day, throughout your posteritie, by an ordinance for euer."
2,12,18,"In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month at"
2,12,19,"Seuen daies shall no leauen be founde in your houses: for whosoeuer eateth leauened bread, that person shalbe cut off from the Congregation of Israel: whether he bee a stranger, or borne in the land."
2,12,20,"Ye shall eate no leauened bread: but in all your habitations shall ye eate vnleauened bread."
2,12,21,"Then Moses called all the Elders of Israel, and saide vnto them, Choose out and take you for euerie of your housholdes a lambe, & kill the Passeouer."
2,12,22,"And take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basen, and strike the lintell, and the doore cheekes with the blood that is in the basen, and let none of you goe out at the doore of his house, vntill the morning."
2,12,23,"For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the"
2,12,24,"Therefore shall ye obserue this thing as an ordinance both for thee and thy sonnes for euer."
2,12,25,"And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the"
2,12,26,"And when your children aske you, What seruice is this ye keepe?"
2,12,27,"That ye shall say, It [is] the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people"
2,12,28,"So the children of Israel went, and did as the Lorde had commanded Moses and Aaron: so did they."
2,12,29,"Nowe at midnight, the Lorde smote all the first borne in the lande of Egypt, from the first borne of Pharaoh that sate on his throne, vnto the first borne of the captiue that was in prison, and all the first borne of beastes."
2,12,30,"And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for [there was]"
2,12,31,"And hee called to Moses and to Aaron by night, and saide, Rise vp, get you out from among my people, both yee, and the children of Israel, and goe serue the Lorde as ye haue sayde."
2,12,32,"Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and"
2,12,33,"And the Egyptians did force the people, because they would send them out of the land in haste: for they said, We die all."
2,12,34,"Therfore the people tooke their dough before it was leauened, euen their dough bound in clothes vpon their shoulders."
2,12,35,"And the children of Israel did according to the saying of Moses, & they asked of ye Egyptians iewels of siluer & iewels of gold, & raiment."
2,12,36,"And the Lorde gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians: and they graunted their request: so they spoyled the Egyptians."
2,12,37,"And the children of Israel journeyed from"
2,12,38,"And"
2,12,39,"And they baked the dough which they brought out of Egypt, & made vnleauened cakes: for it was not leauened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, neither coulde they tarie, nor yet prepare themselues vitailes."
2,12,40,"So the dwelling of the children of Israel, while they dwelled in Egypt, was foure hundreth and thirtie yeres."
2,12,41,"And it came to pass at the end of the"
2,12,42,"It is a night to be kept holie to the Lord, because he brought them out of the lande of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord, which all the children of Israel must keepe throughout their generations."
2,12,43,"And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This [is] the ordinance of the passover:"
2,12,44,"But euerie seruant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof."
2,12,45,"A stranger or an hyred seruant shall not eat thereof."
2,12,46,"In one house shall it bee eaten: thou shalt carie none of ye flesh out of the house, neither shall ye breake a bone thereof."
2,12,47,"All the Congregation of Israel shall obserue it."
2,12,48,"But if a stranger dwell with thee, and will obserue the Passeouer of the Lorde, let him circumcise all the males, that belong vnto him, and then let him come and obserue it, & he shall be as one that is borne in the land: for none vncircumcised person shall eate thereof."
2,12,49,"One"
2,12,50,"Then all the children of Israel did as the Lorde commaunded Moses and Aaron: so did they."
2,12,51,"And the selfe same day did the Lord bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies."
2,13,1,"And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying,"
2,13,2,"Sanctifie vnto me all the first borne: that is, euery one that first openeth the wombe among the children of Israel, as well of man as of beast: for it is mine."
2,13,3,"And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of"
2,13,4,"This day came ye out in the month"
2,13,5,"Now when the Lord hath brought thee into the land of the Canaanites, and Hittites, and Amorites, and Hiuites, and Iebusites (which he sware vnto thy fathers, that he woulde giue thee, a land flowing with milke and honie) then thou shalt keepe this seruice in this moneth."
2,13,6,"Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the"
2,13,7,"Vnleauened bread shall bee eaten seuen dayes, and there shal no leauened bread be seene with thee, nor yet leauen be seene with thee in all thy quarters."
2,13,8,"And thou shalt shew thy son"
2,13,9,"And it shall be for a sign unto thee"
2,13,10,"Keepe therefore this ordinance in his season appoynted from yeere to yeere."
2,13,11,"And when the Lord shall bring thee into the lande of the Canaanites, as hee sware vnto thee and to thy fathers, and shall giue it thee,"
2,13,12,"Then thou shalt set apart vnto the Lorde all that first openeth the wombe: also euery thing that first doeth open the wombe, and commeth forth of thy beast: the males shalbe the Lordes."
2,13,13,"And every firstling of an"
2,13,14,"And when thy sonne shall aske thee to morowe, saying, What is this? thou shalt then say vnto him, With a mightie hande the Lorde brought vs out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."
2,13,15,"For when Pharaoh was harde hearted against our departing, the Lord then slewe all the first borne in the lande of Egypt: from the first borne of man euen to the first borne of beast: therefore I sacrifice vnto the Lorde all the males that first open the wombe, but all the first borne of my sonnes I redeeme."
2,13,16,"And it shalbe as a token vpon thine hand, and as frontlets betweene thine eyes, that the Lorde brought vs out of Egypt by a mightie hande."
2,13,17,"And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not [through] the way of the land of the Philistines, although that [was] near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they"
2,13,18,"But God led the people about, [through] the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up"
2,13,19,"(And Moses tooke the bones of Ioseph with him: for he had made the children of Israel sweare, saying, God will surely visite you, and ye shal take my bones away hence with you)"
2,13,20,"So they tooke their iourney from Succoth, and camped in Etham in the edge of the wildernesse."
2,13,21,"And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a"
2,13,22,"He tooke not away the pillar of ye cloude by day, nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people."
2,14,1,"Then the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
2,14,2,"Speak unto the children of Israel, that they"
2,14,3,"For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are tangled in the land: the wildernesse hath shut them in."
2,14,4,"And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will"
2,14,5,"Then it was told the King of Egypt, that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his seruants was turned against the people, and they sayde, Why haue we this done, and haue let Israel go out of our seruice?"
2,14,6,"And he made ready his charets, and tooke his people with him,"
2,14,7,"And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and"
2,14,8,"And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an"
2,14,9,"And the Egyptians pursued after them, and all the horses and charets of Pharaoh, and his horsemen and his hoste ouertooke them camping by the Sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon."
2,14,10,"And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore"
2,14,11,"And they sayde vnto Moses, Hast thou brought vs to die in the wildernes, because there were no graues in Egypt? wherefore hast thou serued vs thus, to carie vs out of Egypt?"
2,14,12,"[Is] not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let"
2,14,13,"Then Moses sayde to the people, Feare ye not, stand still, and beholde the saluation of the Lord which he will shew to you this day. For the Egyptians, whome ye haue seene this day, ye shall neuer see them againe."
2,14,14,"The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall"
2,14,15,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore"
2,14,16,"And lift thou vp thy rod, and stretche out thine hand vpon the Sea and deuide it, and let the children of Israel goe on drie ground thorow the middes of the Sea."
2,14,17,"And I, beholde, I will harden the heart of the Egyptians, that they may followe them, and I wil get me honour vpon Pharaoh, & vpon all his host, vpon his charets, and vpon his horsemen."
2,14,18,"Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lorde, when I haue gotten me honour vpon Pharaoh, vpon his charets, & vpon his horsemen."
2,14,19,"(And the Angel of God, which went before the hoste of Israel, remoued & went behinde them: also the pillar of the cloude went from before them, and stoode behinde them,"
2,14,20,"And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness [to them], but it gave"
2,14,21,"And Moses stretched forth his hande vpon the Sea, & the Lord caused the sea to runne backe by a strong East winde all the night, & made the Sea dry land: for the waters were deuided."
2,14,22,"Then the children of Israel went through the middes of the Sea vpon the drie ground, and the waters were a wall vnto them on their right hand, and on their left hand."
2,14,23,"And the Egyptians pursued and went after them to the middes of the Sea, euen all Pharaohs horses, his charets, and his horsemen."
2,14,24,"And it came to pass, that in the morning"
2,14,25,"For he tooke off their charet wheeles, and they draue them with much a doe: so that the Egyptians euery one sayd, I wil flee from the face of Israel: for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians."
2,14,26,"Then the Lord sayde to Moses, Stretche thine hand vpon the Sea, that the waters may returne vpon the Egyptians, vpon their charets and vpon their horsemen."
2,14,27,"And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD"
2,14,28,"So the water returned & couered the charets and the horsemen, euen all the hoste of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them: there remained not one of them."
2,14,29,"But the children of Israel walked vpon dry land thorowe the middes of the Sea, and the waters were a wall vnto them on their right hande, and on their left."
2,14,30,"Thus the Lorde saued Israel the same day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel sawe the Egyptians dead vpon the Sea banke."
2,14,31,"And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his"
2,15,1,"Then"
2,15,2,"The LORD [is] my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he [is] my God, and I will"
2,15,3,"The LORD [is] a"
2,15,4,"Pharaohs charets and his host hath he cast into the Sea: his chosen captaines also were drowned in the red Sea."
2,15,5,"The depths haue couered them, they sanke to the bottome as a stone."
2,15,6,"Thy right hande, O Lorde, is glorious in power: thy right hand, O Lorde, hath brused the enemie."
2,15,7,"And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against"
2,15,8,"And by the blast of thy nostrels the waters were gathered, the floods stoode still as an heape, the depthes congealed together in the heart of the Sea."
2,15,9,"The enemie sayd, I wil pursue, I wil ouertake them, I will deuide the spoyle, my lust shall bee satisfied vpon them, I will drawe my sworde, mine hand shall destroy them."
2,15,10,"Thou blewest with thy winde, the Sea couered them, they sanke as leade in the mightie waters."
2,15,11,"Who [is] like unto thee, O LORD, among the"
2,15,12,"Thou stretchedst out thy right hande, the earth swallowed them."
2,15,13,"Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people [which] thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided [them] in thy strength unto thy holy"
2,15,14,"The people shal heare and be afraide: sorow shal come vpon the inhabitants of Palestina."

2,29,35,"Therefore shalt thou doe thus vnto Aaron & vnto his sonnes, according to all things, which I haue commanded thee: seuen dayes shalt thou consecrate them,"
2,29,36,"And thou shalt offer every day a bullock [for] a sin offering for"

2,29,38,"Nowe this is that which thou shalt present vpon the altar: euen two lambes of one yere olde, day by day continually."
2,29,39,"The one lambe thou shalt present in the morning, and the other lambe thou shalt present at euen."
2,29,40,"And with the one lamb a"

2,29,42,"This shalbe a continuall burnt offring in your generations at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord, where I wil make appoyntment with you, to speake there vnto thee."
2,29,43,"And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and [the tabernacle] shall be sanctified by my"

2,29,45,"And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will bee their God."
2,29,46,"And they shall know that I [am] the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them:"
2,30,1,"And thou shalt make an altar"
2,30,2,"A cubit [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits [shall be] the height thereof: the horns thereof [shall be]"
2,30,3,"And thou shalt ouerlay it with fine golde, both the toppe therof and the sides thereof round about, and his hornes: also thou shalt make vnto it a crowne of gold round about."
2,30,4,"Besides this thou shalt make vnder this crowne two golden rings on either side: euen on euery side shalt thou make them, that they may be as places for the barres to beare it withall."
2,30,5,"The which barres thou shalt make of Shittim wood, and shalt couer them with golde."

2,30,11,"Afterward the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
2,30,12,"When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man"
2,30,13,"This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the"

2,30,15,"The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when [they] give an offering unto the LORD,"
2,30,16,"So thou shalt take the money of the redemption of the children of Israel, and shalt put it vnto the vse of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, that it may be a memoriall vnto the children of Israel before the Lorde for the redemption of your liues."
2,30,17,"Also the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
2,30,18,"Thou shalt also make a lauer of brasse, and his foote of brasse to wash, and shalt put it betweene the Tabernacle of the Congregation and the Altar, and shalt put water therein."
2,30,19,"For Aaron and his sons shall"
2,30,20,"When they go into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, or when they goe vnto the Altar to minister and to make the perfume of ye burnt offring to the Lorde, they shall wash themselues with water, lest they die."
2,30,21,"So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute"
2,30,22,"Also the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"
2,30,23,"Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred"
2,30,24,"Also of cassia fiue hundreth, after the shekel of the Sanctuarie, & of oyle oliue an Hin."
2,30,25,"So thou shalt make of it the oyle of holie oyntment, euen a most precious oyntment after the arte of the Apothecarie: this shalbe the oyle of holy oyntment."
2,30,26,"And thou shalt anoint the"
2,30,27,"Also the Table, & al the instruments thereof, and the Candlesticke, with all the instruments thereof, and the altar of incense:"
2,30,28,"Also the Altar of burnt offring with al his instruments, and the lauer and his foote."
2,30,29,"So thou shalt sanctifie them, & they shalbe most holy: all that shal touch them, shalbe holy."
2,30,30,"Thou shalt also anoint Aaron & his sonnes, & shalt consecrate them, that they may minister vnto me in the Priests office."
2,30,31,"Moreouer thou shalt speake vnto the children of Israel, saying, This shalbe an holy oynting oyle vnto me, throughout your generations."
2,30,32,"Upon"
2,30,33,"Whosoever compoundeth [any] like it, or whosoever putteth [any] of it upon"

2,30,35,"Then thou shalt make of them perfume composed after the arte of the apothecarie, mingled together, pure and holy."
2,30,36,"And thou shalt beate it to pouder, & shalt put of it before the Arke of the Testimonie in the Tabernacle of ye Cogregatio, where I wil make appointmet with thee: it shalbe vnto you most holy."
2,30,37,"And ye shal not make vnto you any compositio like this perfume, which thou shalt make: it shalbe vnto thee holy for the Lord."
2,30,38,"Whosoeuer shal make like vnto that to smell thereto, euen he shalbe cut off from his people."
2,31,1,"And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"

2,31,6,"And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are"
2,31,7,"That is, the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the Arke of the Testimonie, & the Merciseate that shalbe therupon, with all instruments of the Tabernacle:"
2,31,8,"And the table and his furniture, and the"
2,31,9,"Likewise the Altar of burnt offring with al his instruments, and the Lauer with his foote:"
2,31,10,"Also the garments of the ministration, & ye holy garments for Aaron ye Priest, & the garmets of his sonnes, to minister in the Priestes office,"
2,31,11,"And the"
2,31,12,"Afterwarde the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,"

2,31,16,"Wherfore the children of Israel shal keepe the Sabbath, that they may obserue the rest throughout their generations for an euerlasting couenant."
2,31,17,"It [is] a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he"
2,31,18,"And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables"
2,32,1,"And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up,"
2,32,2,"And Aaron said unto them,"

2,32,6,"So they rose vp the next day in the morning, and offred burnt offerings, & brought peace offrings: also the people sate them downe to eate and drinke, and rose vp to play."
2,32,7,"Then the Lord said vnto Moses, Go, get thee downe: for thy people which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, hath corrupted their wayes."
2,32,8,"They"
2,32,9,"Againe the Lord said vnto Moses, I haue seene this people, and beholde, it is a stiffe necked people."
2,32,10,"Now"
2,32,11,"But Moses praied vnto the Lord his God, and said, O Lord, why doeth thy wrath waxe hote against thy people, which thou hast brought out of the lande of Egypt, with great power and with a mightie hand?"
2,32,12,"Wherefore shall the Egyptians speake, and say, He hath brought them out maliciously for to slay them in the mountaines, and to consume them from the earth? turne from thy fearce wrath, and change thy minde from this euill towarde thy people."
2,32,13,"Remember"
2,32,14,"Then the Lord changed his minde fro the euil, which he threatned to do vnto his people."
2,32,15,"So Moses returned and went downe from the mountaine with the two Tables of the Testimonie in his hande: the Tables were written on both their sides, euen on the one side and on the other were they written."
2,32,16,"And the tables [were] the work of God, and"
2,32,17,"And when Ioshua heard the noyse of the people, as they shouted, he said vnto Moses, There is a noyse of warre in the hoste."
2,32,18,"Who answered, It is not the noyse of them that haue the victorie, nor the noyse of them that are ouercome: but I do heare ye noyse of singing."
2,32,19,"Nowe, as soone as he came neere vnto the hoste, he sawe the calfe and the dancing: so Moses wrath waxed hote, and he cast the Tables out of his handes, and brake them in pieces beneath the mountaine."
2,32,20,"And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt [it] in the fire, and ground [it] to powder, and strawed [it] upon the water, and made the children of Israel"
2,32,21,"Also Moses said vnto Aaron, What did this people vnto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sinne vpon them?"
2,32,22,"Then Aaron answered, Let not the wrath of my Lord waxe fearce: Thou knowest this people, that they are euen set on mischiefe."
2,32,23,"And they sayde vnto me, Make vs gods to go before vs: for we knowe not what is become of this Moses (the man that brought vs out of the land of Egypt.)"
2,32,24,"Then I sayde to them, Ye that haue golde, plucke it off: and they brought it me, & I did cast it into the fire, and thereof came this calfe."
2,32,25,"And when Moses saw that the people [were]"
2,32,26,"And Moses stoode in ye gate of the campe, and sayde, Who pertaineth to the Lorde? let him come to mee; all the sonnes of Leui gathered themselues vnto him."
2,32,27,"And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, [and] go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and"
2,32,28,"So the children of Leui did as Moses had commanded: and there fel of the people the same day about three thousand men."
2,32,29,"For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his"
2,32,30,"And when the morning came, Moses sayde vnto the people, Yee haue committed a grieuous crime: but now I wil goe vp to the Lord, if I may pacifie him for your sinne."
2,32,31,"Moses therefore went againe vnto ye Lord, and said, Oh, this people haue sinned a great sinne, and haue made them gods of golde."
2,32,32,"Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee,"
2,32,33,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my"

2,32,35,"So the Lorde plagued the people, because they caused Aaro to make ye calfe which he made."
2,33,1,"And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, [and]"
2,33,2,"And I will send an Angel before thee & will cast out the Canaanites, the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, the Hiuites, and the Iebusites:"
2,33,3,"To a lande, I say, that floweth with milke and hony: for I will not goe vp with thee, because thou art a stiffe necked people, least I consume thee in the way."
2,33,4,"And when the people heard this euill tydings, they sorowed, and no man put on his best rayment."
2,33,5,"For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye [are] a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know"
2,33,6,"So the children of Israel layed their good raiment from them, after Moses came downe from the mount Horeb."

2,33,10,"Nowe when all the people saw the cloudie pillar stand at the Tabernacle doore, all the people rose vp, and worshipped euery man in his tent doore."
2,33,11,"And the LORD spake unto Moses"

2,33,13,"Nowe therefore, I pray thee, if I haue founde fauour in thy sight, shewe mee nowe thy way, that I may knowe thee, and that I may finde grace in thy sight: consider also that this nation is thy people."
2,33,14,"And he said, My"

2,33,16,"And wherein nowe shal it be knowen, that I and thy people haue found fauour in thy sight? Shall it not be when thou goest with vs? so I, and thy people shall haue preeminence before all the people that are vpon the earth."

2,34,3,"But let no man come vp with thee, neither let any man be seene throughout all the mount, neyther let the sheepe nor cattell feede before this mount."

2,36,14,"Also he made curtaines of goates heare for the couering vpon the Tabernacle: he made them to the nomber of eleuen curtaines."
2,36,15,"The length of one curtaine had thirtie cubites, & the bredth of one curtaine foure cubites: the eleuen curtaines were of one cise."
2,36,16,"And hee coupled fiue curtaines by themselues, and sixe curtaines by themselues:"
2,36,17,"Also he made fiftie strings vpon the edge of one curtaine in the seluedge in the coupling, & fiftie strings made hee vpon the edge of the other curtaine in the second coupling."
2,36,18,"He made also fiftie taches of brasse to couple the couering that it might be one."
2,36,19,"And he made a"
2,36,20,"And he made boards for the tabernacle [of] shittim wood,"
2,36,21,"The length of a board was ten cubites, and the bredth of one board was a cubite, & an halfe."
2,36,22,"One board had two tenons, set in order as the feete of a ladder, one against another: thus made he for all the boardes of the Tabernacle."
2,36,23,"So he made twentie boardes for the South side of the Tabernacle, euen full South."
2,36,24,"And fourtie sockets of siluer made he vnder the twentie boardes, two sockets vnder one board for his two tenons, and two sockets vnder another board for his two tenons."
2,36,25,"Also for the other side of the Tabernacle toward the North, he made twentie boards,"
2,36,26,"And their fourtie sockets of siluer, two sockets vnder one board, and two sockets vnder another boarde."
2,36,27,"And for the sides of the tabernacle"
2,36,28,"And two boardes made he in the corners of the Tabernacle, for either side,"
2,36,29,"And they were ioyned beneath, and likewise were made sure aboue with a ring: thus he did to both in both corners."
2,36,30,"So there were eight boards & their sixteene sockets of siluer, vnder euery board two sockets."
2,36,31,"After, he made barres of Shittim wood, fiue for the boards in ye one side of ye Tabernacle,"
2,36,32,"And fiue barres for the boardes in the other side of the Tabernacle, and fiue barres for the boards of the Tabernacle on the side toward the West."
2,36,33,"And he made the middest barre to shoote through the boards, from the one end to ye other."
2,36,34,"He ouerlayd also the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the barres, and couered the barres with golde."
2,36,35,"And he made a"
2,36,36,"And made thereunto foure pillars of Shittim, & ouerlayd them with golde: whose hookes were also of golde, and hee cast for them foure sockets of siluer."
2,36,37,"And he made an"
2,36,38,"And the fiue pillars of it with their hookes, and ouerlayde their chapiters & their filets with golde, but their fiue sockets were of brasse."
2,37,1,"After this, Bezaleel made the Arke of Shittim wood, two cubites and an halfe long and a cubite and an halfe broade, and a cubite and an halfe hie:"
2,37,2,"And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a"
2,37,3,"And cast for it foure rings of golde for the foure corners of it: that is, two rings for the one side of it, & two rings for the other side thereof."
2,37,4,"Also he made barres of Shittim wood, and couered them with golde,"
2,37,5,"And put the barres in the rings by the sides of the Arke, to beare the Arke."
2,37,6,"And he made the Merciseate of pure golde: two cubites and an halfe was the length thereof, and one cubite and an halfe the breadth thereof."
2,37,7,"And he made two Cherubims of gold, vpo the two endes of the Merciseate: euen of worke beaten with the hammer made he them."
2,37,8,"One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the [other] end on that side: out"
2,37,9,"And the Cherubims spread out their wings on hie, & couered the Merciseat with their wings, & their faces were one towards another: towarde the Merciseat were the faces of the Cherubims."
2,37,10,"Also he made ye Table of Shittim wood: two cubites was the length thereof, and a cubite the breadth thereof, and a cubite and an halfe the height of it."
2,37,11,"And hee ouerlayde it with fine golde, and made thereto a crowne of golde round about."
2,37,12,"Also he made thereto a border of an hand breadth round about, and made vpon the border a crowne of golde round about."
2,37,13,"And he cast for it foure rings of gold, and put the rings in the foure corners that were in the foure feete thereof."
2,37,14,"Against the border were the rings, as places for the barres to beare the Table."
2,37,15,"And he made the barres of Shittim wood, & couered them with golde to beare the Table."
2,37,16,"Also he made the instruments for the Table of pure golde: dishes for it, and incense cuppes for it, and goblets for it, & couerings for it, wherewith it should be couered."
2,37,17,"Likewise he made the Candlesticke of pure golde: of worke beaten out with the hammer made he the Candlesticke: and his shaft, and his branche, his bolles, his knops, and his floures were of one piece."
2,37,18,"And sixe branches came out of the sides thereof: three branches of the Candlesticke out of the one side of it, and three branches of the Candlesticke out of the other side of it."
2,37,19,"In one branche three bolles made like almondes, a knop & a floure: and in another branch three bolles made like almondes, a knop and a floure: and so throughout the sixe branches that proceeded out of the Candlesticke."
2,37,20,"And vpon the Candlesticke were foure bolles after the facion of almondes, the knoppes thereof and the floures thereof:"
2,37,21,"That is, vnder euery two branches a knop made thereof, & a knop vnder the second branch thereof, and a knop vnder the thirde branche thereof, according to the sixe branches comming out of it."
2,37,22,"Their knops & their branches were of the same: it was all one beaten worke of pure gold."
2,37,23,"And he made for it seuen lampes with the snuffers, and snufdishes thereof of pure golde."
2,37,24,"[Of] a"

2,37,26,"And he couered it with pure gold, both the top and the sides thereof rounde about, and the hornes of it, and made vnto it a crowne of golde round about."
2,37,27,"And he made two rings of gold for it, vnder the crowne thereof in the two corners of the two sides thereof, to put barres in for to beare it therewith."
2,37,28,"Also he made the barres of Shittim wood, and ouerlayde them with golde."
2,37,29,"And he made the holy anointing oyle, & the sweete pure incense after ye apothecaries arte."
2,38,1,"Also he made the altar of the burnt offering of Shittim wood: fiue cubites was the length therof, and fiue cubites the breadth thereof: it was square and three cubites hie."
2,38,2,"And hee made vnto it hornes in the foure corners thereof: the hornes thereof were of the same, and he ouerlayd it with brasse."
2,38,3,"Also he made al the instruments of the altar: the ashpans, and the besoms, and the basins, the fleshhookes, and the censers: all the instruments thereof made he of brasse."
2,38,4,"And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the"

2,38,6,"And he made the barres of Shittim wood, and couered them with brasse."
2,38,7,"The which barres he put into the rings on the sides of the altar to beare it withall, & made it hollow within the boardes."
2,38,8,"And he made the laver [of] brass, and the foot of it [of] brass, of the"

2,38,28,"But he made the hookes for the pillars of a thousande seuen hundreth and seuentie and fiue shekels, and ouerlayde their chapiters, and made filets about them."
2,38,29,"And the brass of the offering [was] seventy"
2,38,30,"Whereof he made the sockets to the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate which was for it, with all the instruments of the Altar,"
2,38,31,"And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets for the court gate, & al the pins of the Tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about."
2,39,1,"And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made"

2,39,3,"And they did beate the golde into thinne plates, and cut it into wiers, to worke it in ye blewe silke and in the purple, and in the skarlet, and in the fine linen, with broydred worke."
2,39,4,"For the which they made shoulders to couple together: for it was closed by the two edges thereof."
2,39,5,"And the broydred garde of his Ephod that was vpon him, was of the same stuffe, and of like worke: euen of golde, of blewe silke, and purple, & skarlet, and fine twined linen, as the Lorde had commanded Moses."
2,39,6,"And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as"

2,39,8,"Also he made the brestplate of broydred worke like the worke of the Ephod: to wit, of gold, blewe silke, and purple, and skarlet, and fine twined linen."
2,39,9,"They made the brest plate double, & it was square, an hand breadth long, & an hand breadth broad: it was also double."
2,39,10,"And they filled it with foure rowes of stones. The order was thus, a Rubie, a Topaze, & a Carbuncle in the first rowe:"
2,39,11,"And in the seconde rowe, an Emeraude, a Saphir, and a Diamond:"
2,39,12,"And the third row,"

2,39,14,"And the stones [were] according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve,"
2,39,15,"After, they made vpon the brest plate cheines at the endes, of wrethen worke and pure golde."
2,39,16,"They made also two bosses of golde, and two golde rings, and put the two rings in the two corners of the brest plate."
2,39,17,"And they put ye two wrethe cheines of gold in the two rings, in the corners of the brest plate."
2,39,18,"Also the two other endes of the two wrethen chaines they fastened in the two bosses, and put the on the shoulders of the Ephod vpon the forefront of it."
2,39,19,"Likewise they made two rings of gold, and put them in the two other corners of the brest plate vpon the edge of it, which was on the inside of the Ephod."
2,39,20,"They made also two other golden rings, & put them on the two sides of the Ephod, beneath on the foreside of it, & ouer against his coupling aboue the broydered garde of the Ephod."
2,39,21,"Then they fastened the brest plate by his rings vnto the rings of the Ephod, with a lace of blewe silke, that it might bee fast vpon the broydered garde of the Ephod, and that the brest plate should not be loosed fro the Ephod, as the Lorde had commanded Moses."
2,39,22,"And he made the robe of the"

2,39,24,"And they made vpon the skirts of the robe pomegranates, of blewe silke, and purple, and skarlet, and fine linen twined."
2,39,25,"They made also belles of pure gold and put the belles betweene the pomegranates vpon the skirtes of the robe rounde about betweene the pomegranates."
2,39,26,"A bel and a pomegranate, a bel & a pomegranate round about the skirts of the robe to minister in, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
2,39,27,"After, they made coates of fine linen, of wouen worke for Aaron and for his sonnes."
2,39,28,"And the miter of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,"
2,39,29,"And the girdle of fine twined linen, and of blew silke, and purple, and skarlet, euen of needle worke, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
2,39,30,"Finally they made the plate for the holy crowne of fine golde, and wrote vpon it a superscription like to the grauing of a signet, HOLINES TO THE LORD."
2,39,31,"And they tied vnto it a lace of blewe silke to fasten it on hie vpon the miter, as the Lorde had commanded Moses."
2,39,32,"Thus was all the worke of the Tabernacle, euen of the Tabernacle of the Congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to al that the Lord had commanded Moses: so dyd they."
2,39,33,"Afterwarde they brought the Tabernacle vnto Moses, the Tabernacle and al his instruments, his taches, his boards, his barres, and his pillers, and his sockets,"

2,40,5,"And thou shalt set the altar"
2,40,6,"Moreouer, thou shalt set the burnt offering Altar before the doore of the Tabernacle, called the Tabernacle of the Congregation."
2,40,7,"And thou shalt set the Lauer betweene the Tabernacle of the Congregation and the Altar, and put water therein."
2,40,8,"Then thou shalt appoynt the courte round about, and hang vp the hanging at the courte gate."
2,40,9,"After, thou shalt take the anoynting oyle, and anoynt the Tabernacle, and all that is therein, and halowe it with all the instruments thereof, that it may be holy."
2,40,10,"And thou shalt anoynt the Altar of the burnt offring, and all his instrumentes, and shalt sanctifie the Altar, that it may bee an altar most holie."
2,40,11,"Also thou shalt anoynt the Lauer, and his foote, and shalt sanctifie it."
2,40,12,"Then thou shalt bring Aaron & his sonnes vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and wash them with water."
2,40,13,"And thou shalt put vpon Aaron the holy garmentes, and shalt anoynt him, and sanctifie him, that he may minister vnto me in the Priestes office."
2,40,14,"Thou shalt also bring his sonnes, & clothe them with garments,"
2,40,15,"And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing"
2,40,16,"So Moses did according to all that ye Lorde had commanded him: so did he."
2,40,17,"And it came to pass in the first month in"
2,40,18,"Then Moses reared vp the Tabernacle and fastened his sockets, and set vp the boardes thereof, and put in the barres of it, and reared vp his pillars."
2,40,19,"And he spred the couering ouer the Tabernacle, and put the couering of that couering on hie aboue it, as the Lorde had commaunded Moses."
2,40,20,"And he took and put the"
2,40,21,"He brought also the Arke into the Tabernacle, and hanged vp the couering vaile, and couered the Arke of the Testimonie, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
2,40,22,"Furthermore he put the Table in the Tabernacle of the Congregation in the Northside of the Tabernacle, without the vaile,"
2,40,23,"And set the bread in order before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
2,40,24,"Also he put the Candlesticke in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, ouer against the Table toward ye Southside of the Tabernacle."
2,40,25,"And he lighted the lampes before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
2,40,26,"Moreouer he set the golden Altar in the Tabernacle of the Congregation before the vayle,"
2,40,27,"And burnt sweete incense thereon, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
2,40,28,"And he set up the hanging [at] the"

2,40,30,"Likewise he set the Lauer betweene the Tabernacle of the Congregation and the Altar, and powred water therein to wash with."
2,40,31,"So Moses and Aaron, and his sonnes washed their handes and their feete thereat."
2,40,32,"When they went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and when they approched to the Altar, they washed, as the Lord had commanded Moses."
2,40,33,"Finally, he reared vp the court rounde about the Tabernacle and the Altar, and hanged vp the vaile at the court gate: so Moses finished the worke."
2,40,34,"Then the cloud couered the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the glorie of the Lorde filled the Tabernacle."
2,40,35,"So Moses could not enter into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, because the cloude abode thereon, and the glorie of the Lorde filled the Tabernacle."
2,40,36,"Nowe when the cloude ascended vp from the Tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward in all their iourneyes."

3,9,16,"So he offred the burnt offring, and prepared it, according to the maner."
3,9,17,"He presented also the meate offring, & filled his hand thereof, and beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning he burnt this vpon the Altar."
3,9,18,"He slewe also the bullock, and the ram for the peace offrings, that was for the people, and Arons sonnes brought vnto him the blood, which he sprinkled vpon the Altar round about,"

6,5,15,"And the captaine of ye Lords host said vnto Ioshua, Loose thy shoe of thy foote: for ye place wheron thou standest, is holy: and Ioshua did so."
6,6,1,"Now Jericho was straitly"
6,6,2,"And the Lorde saide vnto Ioshua, Behold, I haue giuen into thine hand Iericho and the King thereof, and the strong men of warre."
6,6,3,"And ye shall compass the city, all [ye] men of war, [and] go round about the city"
6,6,4,"And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of"

6,6,6,"Then, Ioshua the sonne of Nun called the Priests & said vnto them, Take vp the Arke of the couenant, and let seuen Priests beare seuen trumpets of rams hornes before the Arke of the Lord."
6,6,7,"And he said unto the people,"
6,6,8,"And when Ioshua had spoken vnto the people, the seuen Priestes bare the seuen trumpets of rams hornes, and went foorth before the Arke of the Lorde, and blew with the trumpets, & the Arke of the couenant of ye Lord followed them."
6,6,9,"And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the"
6,6,10,"(Nowe Ioshua had commaunded the people, saying, Ye shall nor shout, neither make any noyse with your voyce, neither shall a worde proceede out of your mouth, vntill the day that I say vnto you, Shout, then shall ye shoute)"
6,6,11,"So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about [it]"
6,6,12,"And Ioshua rose early in the morning, and the Priestes bare the Arke of the Lord:"
6,6,13,"And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the"
6,6,14,"And the second day they compassed the citie once, and returned into the host: thus they did sixe dayes."
6,6,15,"And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner"
6,6,16,"And when the Priests had blowen ye trumpets the seuenth time, Ioshua said vnto ye people, Shoute: for the Lord hath giuen you the citie."
6,6,17,"And the city shall be"
6,6,18,"Notwithstanding, be ye ware of the execrable thing, lest ye make your selues execrable, and in taking of the execrable thing, make also the hoste of Israel execrable, and trouble it."
6,6,19,"But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, [are]"
6,6,20,"So the people shouted, whe they had blowen trumpets: for when the people had heard the sound of the trumpet, they shouted with a great shoute: and the wall fel downe flat: so the people went vp into the citie, euery man streight before him: and they tooke the citie."
6,6,21,"And they vtterly destroyed all that was in the citie, both man and woman, yong, and olde, and oxe, and sheepe, and asse, with the edge of the sword."
6,6,22,"But Ioshua had said vnto the two men that had spied out the countrey, Go into the harlots house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware to her."
6,6,23,"And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them"
6,6,24,"And they burnt the city with fire, and all that [was] therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the"
6,6,25,"And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she"
6,6,26,"And Joshua adjured [them] at that time, saying, Cursed [be] the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho:"
6,6,27,"So the Lord was with Ioshua, and he was famous through all the world."
6,7,1,"But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the"
6,7,2,"And Joshua sent men from Jericho to"
6,7,3,"And returned to Ioshua, and saide vnto him, Let not al the people go vp, but let as it were two or three thousand men go vp, and smite Ai, and make not al the people to labour thither, for they are fewe."
6,7,4,"So there went vp thither of the people about three thousande men, and they fledde before the men of Ai."
6,7,5,"And the"
6,7,6,"Then Ioshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth vpon his face before the Arke of the Lord, vntill the euentide, he, and the Elders of Israel, and put dust vpon their heads."

6,7,8,"Oh Lord, what shal I say, when Israel turne their backes before their enemies?"
6,7,9,"For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear [of it], and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great"
6,7,10,"And the Lord said vnto Ioshua, Get thee vp: wherefore lyest thou thus vpon thy face?"
6,7,11,"Israel hath sinned, and they haue transgressed my couenant, which I commanded them: for they haue euen taken of the excomunicate thing, and haue also stollen, and dissembled also, and haue put it euen with their owne stuffe."
6,7,12,"Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, [but] turned [their] backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye"
6,7,13,"Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, [There is] an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the"
6,7,14,"In the morning therefore ye shall come according to your tribes, and the tribe which the Lord taketh, shal come according to the families: and the familie which the Lorde shall take, shall come by the housholds: and the houshold which the Lord shall take, shall come man by man."
6,7,15,"And it shall be, [that] he that is"
6,7,16,"So Ioshua rose vp earely in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes: and the tribe of Iudah was taken."
6,7,17,"And he brought the families of Iudah, and tooke the familie of the Zarhites, and he brought the familie of the Zarhites, man by man, and Zabdi was taken."
6,7,18,"And he brought his houshold, man by man, and Achan ye sonne of Carmi, the sonne of Zabdi, the sonne of Zerah of the tribe of Iudah was take."
6,7,19,"And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and"
6,7,20,"And Achan answered Ioshua, and saide, In deede, I haue sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus, and thus haue I done."
6,7,21,"When I saw among the spoils a goodly"
6,7,22,"Then Ioshua sent messengers, which ran vnto the tent, and beholde, it was hid in his tent, and the siluer vnder it."
6,7,23,"Therefore they tooke them out of the tent, and brought them vnto Ioshua, and vnto all the children of Israel, and layd them before the Lord."
6,7,24,"And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the"
6,7,25,"And Joshua said,"
6,7,26,"And they cast vpon him a great heape of stones vnto this day: and so the Lord turned from his fierce wrath: therefore hee called the name of that place, The valley of Achor, vnto this day."
6,8,1,"After, the Lord saide vnto Ioshua, Feare not, neither bee thou faint hearted: take all the men of warre with thee and arise, go vp to Ai: beholde, I haue giuen into thine hand the King of Ai, and his people, and his citie, and his land."
6,8,2,"And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city"
6,8,3,"Then Ioshua arose, and all the men of warre to goe vp against Ai: and Ioshua chose out thirtie thousand strong men, and valiant, and sent them away by night."
6,8,4,"And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye"
6,8,5,"And I and all the people that are with me, will approche vnto the citie: and when they shall come out against vs, as they did at the first time, then will we flee before them."
6,8,6,"For they wil come out after vs, till we haue brought them out of the citie: for they will say, They flee before vs as at the first time: so we will flee before them."
6,8,7,"Then you shall rise vp from lying in waite and destroy the citie: for the Lord your God wil deliuer it into your hand."
6,8,8,"And when ye haue taken the citie, ye shall set it on fire: according to the commandement of the Lord shall ye do: behold, I haue charged you."
6,8,9,"Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night"
6,8,10,"And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and"
6,8,11,"Also all the men of warre that were with him went vp and drewe neere, and came against the citie, and pitched on the Northside of Ai: and there was a valley betweene them and Ai."
6,8,12,"And he took about five thousand men,"
6,8,13,"And when they had set the people, [even] all the host that [was] on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the"
6,8,14,"And when the King of Ai sawe it, then the men of the citie hasted and rose vp earely, and went out against Israel to battell, hee and all his people at the time appointed, before the plaine: for he knew not that any lay in waite against him on the backeside of the citie."
6,8,15,"And Joshua and all Israel"
6,8,16,"And all the people of the citie were called together, to pursue after them: and they pursued after Ioshua, & were drawen away out of the city,"
6,8,17,"So that there was not a man left in Ai, nor in Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the citie open, and pursued after Israel."
6,8,18,"And the LORD said unto Joshua,"
6,8,19,"And they that lay in wait, arose quickly out of their place, and ranne as soone as he had stretched out his hand, and they entred into the citie, and tooke it, and hasted, and set the citie on fire."
6,8,20,"And the men of Ai looked behinde them, and sawe it: for loe, the smoke of the citie ascended vp to heauen, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: for the people that fled to the wildernesse, turned backe vpon the pursuers."
6,8,21,"When Ioshua and all Israel sawe that they that lay in waite, had taken the citie, and that the smoke of the citie mounted vp, then they turned againe and slewe the men of Ai."
6,8,22,"And the"
6,8,23,"And the King of Ai they tooke aliue, and brought him to Ioshua."
6,8,24,"And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and"
6,8,25,"And all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelue thousande, euen all the men of Ai."
6,8,26,"For Ioshua drewe not his hande backe againe which he had stretched out with the speare, vntill hee had vtterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai."
6,8,27,"Onely the cattell and the spoyle of this citie, Israel tooke for a praye vnto themselues, according vnto the worde of the Lorde, which hee commaunded Ioshua."
6,8,28,"And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for"
6,8,29,"And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded"
6,8,30,"Then Ioshua built an altar vnto the Lord God of Israel, in mount Ebal,"
6,8,31,"As Moses the seruant of the Lord had commaunded the children of Israel, as it is written in the booke of the Lawe of Moses, an altar of whole stone, ouer which no man had lift an yron: and they offered thereon burnt offrings vnto the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings."
6,8,32,"And he wrote there upon the stones a"
6,8,33,"And all Israel (and their Elders, and officers and their iudges stoode on this side of the Arke, and on that side, before the Priestes of the Leuites, which bare the Arke of the couenant of the Lorde) as well the stranger, as he that is borne in the countrey: halfe of them were ouer against mount Gerizim, and halfe of them ouer against mount Ebal, as Moses the seruant of the Lorde had commaunded before, that they should blesse the people of Israel."
6,8,34,"Then afterwarde hee read all the wordes of the Lawe, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the booke of the Lawe."
6,8,35,"There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the"
6,9,1,"And it came to pass, when all the kings which"
6,9,2,"They gathered themselues together, to fight against Ioshua, & against Israel with one accord."
6,9,3,"But the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Ioshua had done vnto Iericho, and to Ai."
6,9,4,"They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and"
6,9,5,"And olde shoes and clouted vpon their feete: also the raiment vpon them was old, and all their prouision of bread was dried, and mouled."
6,9,6,"So they came vnto Ioshua into the hoste to Gilgal, and said vnto him, and vnto the men of Israel, Wee be come from a farre countrey: nowe therefore make a league with vs."
6,9,7,"And the men of Israel said unto the"
6,9,8,"And they said vnto Ioshua, We are thy seruants. Then Ioshua saide vnto them, Who are ye? And whence come ye?"
6,9,9,"And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of"
6,9,10,"And all that he hath done to the two Kings of the Amorites that were beyonde Iorden, to Sihon King of Heshbon, & to Og King of Bashan, which were at Ashtaroth."
6,9,11,"Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabitants of our countrey spake to vs, saying, Take vitailes with you for the iourney, and go to meete them, and say vnto them, Wee are your seruants: now therefore make ye a league with vs."
6,9,12,"This our"
6,9,13,"Also these bottels of wine which we filled, were newe, and lo, they be rent, and these our garments and our shooes are olde, by reason of the exceeding great iourney."
6,9,14,"And the"
6,9,15,"So Ioshua made peace with them, & made a league with them, that he would suffer them to liue: also the Princes of the Congregation sware vnto them."
6,9,16,"But at the end of three dayes, after they had made a league with them, they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them."
6,9,17,"And the children of Israel"
6,9,18,"And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation"
6,9,19,"Then all the Princes said vnto all the Congregation, We haue sworne vnto them by the Lord God of Israel: nowe therefore we may not touch them."
6,9,20,"This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the"
6,9,21,"And the Princes sayd vnto them againe, Let them liue, but they shall hewe wood, and drawe water vnto all the Congregation, as the Princes appoint them."
6,9,22,"Ioshua then called them, and talked with them, and sayd, Wherefore haue ye beguiled vs, saying, We are very farre from you, when ye dwel among vs?"
6,9,23,"Now therefore ye [are] cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for"
6,9,24,"And they answered Ioshua, and sayd, Because it was tolde thy seruants, that the Lord thy God had commanded his seruant Moses to giue you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land out of your sight, therefore we were exceeding sore afraid for our liues at the presence of you, and haue done this thing:"
6,9,25,"And beholde nowe, we are in thine hand: doe as it seemeth good and right in thine eyes to doe vnto vs."
6,9,26,"And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the"

6,10,1,"Now when Adoni-zedek King of Ierusalem had heard how Ioshua had taken Ai and had destroyed it, ( for as he had done to Iericho and to the King thereof, so he had done to Ai and to the King thereof) and howe the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them,"
6,10,2,"Then they feared exceedingly: for Gibeon was a great citie, as one of the royall cities: for it was greater then Ai, and all the men thereof were mightie."
6,10,3,"Wherefore"
6,10,4,"Come vp vnto me, and helpe me, that we may smite Gibeon: for they haue made peace with Ioshua and with the children of Israel."
6,10,5,"Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made"
6,10,6,"And the men of Gibeon sent vnto Ioshua, euen to the hoste to Gilgal, saying, Withdrawe not thine hand from thy seruants: come vp to vs quickly, and saue vs, & helpe vs: for all the Kings of the Amorites which dwell in the mountaines, are gathered together against vs."
6,10,7,"So Ioshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of warre with him, and all the men of might."
6,10,8,"And the LORD said unto Joshua,"
6,10,9,"Ioshua therefore came vnto them suddenly: for he went vp from Gilgal all the night."
6,10,10,"And the Lord discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth vp to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah and to Makkedah."
6,10,11,"And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, [and] were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: [they were] more which died with"
6,10,12,"Then spake Ioshua to the Lord, in the day when the Lord gaue the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he sayd in the sight of Israel, Sunne, stay thou in Gibeon, and thou moone, in the valley of Aialon."
6,10,13,"And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. [Is] not this written in the book of"

6,10,16,"But the fiue Kings fled and were hid in a caue at Makkedah."
6,10,17,"And it was tolde Ioshua, saying, The fiue Kings are found hid in a caue at Makkedah."
6,10,18,"Then Ioshua said, Roule great stones vpon the mouth of the caue, and set men by it for to keepe them."
6,10,19,"But stand ye not still: followe after your enemies, and smite all the hindmost, suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the Lorde your God hath giuen them into your hand."
6,10,20,"And when Ioshua and the children of Israel had made an ende of slaying them with an exceeding great slaughter till they were consumed, and the rest that remained of them were entred into walled cities,"
6,10,21,"And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in"
6,10,22,"After, Ioshua sayd, Open the mouth of the caue, and bring out these fiue Kings vnto me forth of the caue."
6,10,23,"And they did so, & brought out those fiue Kings vnto him forth of the caue, euen the King of Ierusalem, the King of Hebron, ye King of Iarmuth, the King of Lachish, and the King of Eglon."
6,10,24,"And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the"

6,10,26,"So then Ioshua smote them, and slewe them, and hanged them on fiue trees, and they hanged still vpon the trees vntill the euening."
6,10,27,"And at the going downe of the sunne, Ioshua gaue commaundement, that they should take them downe off the trees, and cast them into the caue (wherein they had bene hid) and they layde great stones vpon the caues mouth, which remaine vntill this day."
6,10,28,"And that same day Ioshua tooke Makkedah & smote it with the edge of the sword, and the King thereof destroyed he with them, and all the soules that were therein, he let none remaine: for hee did to the King of Makkedah as he had done vnto the King of Iericho."
6,10,29,"Then Ioshua went from Makkedah, and all Israel with him vnto Libnah, and fought against Libnah."
6,10,30,"And the Lorde gaue it also and the King thereof into the hand of Israel: and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that were therein: he let none remaine in it: for he did vnto the King thereof, as he had done vnto the King of Iericho."
6,10,31,"And Ioshua departed from Libnah, and all Israel with him vnto Lachish, and besieged it, and assaulted it."
6,10,32,"And the Lord gaue Lachish into the hand of Israel, which tooke it the second day, & smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that were therein, according to all as he had done to Libnah."
6,10,33,"Then Horam King of Gezer came vp to helpe Lachish: but Ioshua smote him and his people, vntill none of his remained."
6,10,34,"And from Lachish Ioshua departed vnto Eglon, and all Israel with him, & they besieged it, and assaulted it,"
6,10,35,"And they tooke it the same day, & smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soules that were therein he vtterly destroyed the same day, according to all that he had done to Lachish."
6,10,36,"Then Ioshua went vp from Eglon, and all Israel with him vnto Hebron, and they fought against it."
6,10,37,"And when they had taken it, they smote it with the edge of the sword, & the King thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the soules that were therein: he left none remaining, according to all as he had done to Eglon: for he destroyed it vtterly, and all the soules that were therein."
6,10,38,"So Ioshua returned, and all Israel with him to Debir, and fought against it."
6,10,39,"And when he had taken it, and the King thereof, and all the citie thereof, they smote them with the edge of the sword, and vtterly destroyed all the soules that were therein, he let none remaine: as he did to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the King thereof, as he had also done to Libnah, and to the King thereof."
6,10,40,"So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the"
6,10,41,"And Ioshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea euen vnto Azzah, and all the countrey of Goshen, euen vnto Gibeon."
6,10,42,"And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at"

6,11,5,"So all these Kings met together, and came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, for to fight against Israel."
6,11,6,"And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt"
6,11,7,"Then came Ioshua and al the men of warre with him against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell vpon them."
6,11,8,"And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto"
6,11,9,"And Ioshua did vnto them as the Lorde bade him: he houghed their horses, & burnt their charets with fire."
6,11,10,"At that time also Ioshua turned backe, and tooke Hazor, & smote the King thereof with the sword: for Hazor before time was the head of all those kingdomes."
6,11,11,"And they smote all the"

6,24,5,"I sent Moses also & Aaron, and I plagued Egypt: and when I had so done among them, I brought you out."
6,24,6,"So I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and ye came vnto the Sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with charets and horsemen vnto the red sea."

6,24,17,"For the Lorde our God, he brought vs and our fathers out of the lande of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and he did those great miracles in our sight, and preserued vs in all the way that we went, and among all the people through whome we came."
6,24,18,"And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: [therefore] will we also serve the LORD;"
6,24,19,"And Ioshua saide vnto the people, Ye can not serue the Lorde: for he is an holie God: he is a ielous God: hee will not pardon your iniquitie nor your sinnes."
6,24,20,"If yee forsake the Lorde and serue strange gods, then he will returne and bring euill vpon you, and consume you, after that hee hath done you good."

6,24,33,"Also Eleazar the sonne of Aaron died, whome they buried in the hill of Phinehas his sonne, which was giuen him in mount Ephraim."

7,1,20,"And they gaue Hebron vnto Caleb, as Moses had saide, and hee expelled thence the three sonnes of Anak."
7,1,21,"And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that"
7,1,22,"They also that were of the house of Ioseph, went vp to Beth-el, and the Lord was with them,"
7,1,23,"And the house of Ioseph caused to viewe Beth-el (and the name of the citie beforetime was Luz)"

7,1,25,"And when hee had shewed them the waie into the citie, they smote the citie with the edge of the sworde, but they let the man and all his housholde depart."
7,1,26,"Then the man went into the lande of the Hittites, and built a citie, and called the name thereof Luz, which is the name thereof vnto this daie."
7,1,27,"Neither did Manasseh drive out [the inhabitants of] Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns:"

7,9,49,"And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put [them] to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem"

7,9,55,"And when the men of Israel sawe that Abimelech was dead, they departed euery man vnto his owne place."
7,9,56,"Thus God rendred the wickednes of Abimelech, which he did vnto his father, in slaying his seuentie brethren."
7,9,57,"And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the"

7,10,7,"Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he solde them into the hands of the Philistims, and into the handes of the children of Ammon:"
7,10,8,"And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years,"
7,10,9,"Moreouer, the children of Ammon went ouer Iorden to fight against Iudah, and against Beniamin, and against the house of Ephraim: so that Israel was sore tormented."
7,10,10,"And the children of Israel"

7,11,9,"And Iphtah said vnto the Elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home againe to fight against the children of Ammon, if the Lord giue them before me, shall I be your head?"
7,11,10,"And the Elders of Gilead saide to Iphtah, The Lorde be witnesse betweene vs, if we doe not according to thy wordes."
7,11,11,"Then Iphtah went with the Elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captaine ouer them: and Iphtah rehearsed all his wordes before the Lorde in Mizpeh."
7,11,12,"Then Iphtah sent messengers vnto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to doe with me, that thou art come against me, to fight in my lande?"
7,11,13,"And the King of the children of Ammon answered vnto the messengers of Iphtah, Because Israel tooke my lande, when they came vp from Egypt, fro Arnon vnto Iabbok, & vnto Iorden: now therefore restore those lands quietly."
7,11,14,"Yet Iphtah sent messengers againe vnto the King of the children of Ammon,"
7,11,15,"And said vnto him, Thus saith Iphtah, Israel tooke not the lande of Moab, nor the lande of the children of Ammon."
7,11,16,"But when Israel came vp from Egypt, and walked through the wildernesse vnto the redde Sea, then they came to Kadesh."
7,11,17,"And Israel sent messengers vnto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, goe thorowe thy lande: but the King of Edom woulde not consent: and also they sent vnto the King of Moab, but he would not: therefore Israel abode in Kadesh."
7,11,18,"Then they went through the wildernesse, and compassed the lande of Edom, and the lande of Moab, and came by the Eastside of the lande of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, and came not within the coast of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab."
7,11,19,"Also Israel sent messengers vnto Sihon, King of the Amorites, the King of Heshbon, and Israel said vnto him, Let vs passe, we pray thee, by thy lande vnto our place."
7,11,20,"But Sihon"

7,11,23,"Nowe therefore the Lorde God of Israel hath cast out the Amorites before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possesse it?"

7,11,39,"And after the ende of two moneths, she turned againe vnto her father, who did with her according to his vowe which he had vowed, and she had knowen no man; it was a custome in Israel:"
7,11,40,"The daughters of Israel went yere by yere to lament the daughter of Iphtah the Gileadite, foure dayes in a yeere."
7,12,1,"And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went"

7,12,3,"And when I saw that ye delivered [me] not,"
7,12,4,"Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites [are] fugitives of Ephraim"
7,12,5,"Also the Gileadites tooke the passages of Iorden before the Ephraimites, and when the Ephraimites that were escaped, saide, Let me passe, then the men of Gilead said vnto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay,"
7,12,6,"Then said they unto him, Say now"
7,12,7,"And Iphtah iudged Israel sixe yeere: then dyed Iphtah the Gileadite, and was buryed in one of the cities of Gilead."
7,12,8,"And after him"
7,12,9,"Who had thirtie sonnes and thirtie daughters, which he sent out, & tooke in thirtie daughters from abroade for his sonnes; he iudged Israel seuen yeere."

7,12,11,"And after him iudged Israel Elon, a Zebulonite, and he iudged Israel tenne yeere."
7,12,12,"Then Elon the Zebulonite dyed, and was buryed in Aijalon in the countrey of Zebulun."
7,12,13,"And after him Abdon the sonne of Hillel the Pirathonite iudged Israel."
7,12,14,"And he had fourty sonnes and thirtie nephewes that rode on seuentie assecoltes: and he iudged Israel eight yeeres."
7,12,15,"Then dyed Abdon the sonne of Hillel the Pirathonite, & was buryed in Pirathon, in ye lande of Ephraim, in the Mount of the Amalekites."
7,13,1,"Bvt the children of Israel continued to commit wickednesse in the sight of the Lorde, and the Lorde deliuerd them into the handes of the Philistims fourtie yeere."

7,15,14,"When hee came to Lehi, the Philistims shouted against him, and the Spirite of the Lord came vpon him, and the cordes that were vpon his armes, became as flaxe that was burnt with fire: for the bandes loosed from his handes."
7,15,15,"And he found a"
7,15,16,"Then Samson sayd, With the iaw of an asse are heapes vpon heapes: with the iawe of an asse haue I slaine a thousand men."
7,15,17,"And when he had left speaking, hee cast away the iawebone out of his hande, and called that place, Ramath-Lehi."
7,15,18,"And he was sore athirst, and"
7,15,19,"Then God brake the cheeke tooth, that was in the iawe, and water came thereout: and when he had drunke, his Spirit came againe, and he was reuiued: wherefore the name therof is called, Enhakkore, which is in Lehi vnto this day."
7,15,20,"And hee iudged Israel in the dayes of the Philistims twentie yeeres."
7,16,1,"Then went Samson to"
7,16,2,"And it was tolde to the Azzahites, Samson is come hither. And they went about, and laied wayte for him all night in the gate of the citie, & were quiet all the nyght, saying, Abide till the morning earely, and we shall kill him."
7,16,3,"And Samson slept till midnight, and arose at midnight, and tooke the doores of the gates of the citie, and the two postes and lift them away with the barres, and put them vpon his shoulders, and caried them vp to the top of the mountaine that is before Hebron."
7,16,4,"And after this hee loued a woman by the riuer of Sorek, whose name was Delilah:"
7,16,5,"And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength [lieth], and by what [means] we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred"
7,16,6,"And Delilah saide to Samson, Tell mee, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest bee bound, to doe thee hurt."
7,16,7,"Samson then answered vnto her, If they binde mee with seuen greene cordes, that were neuer dryed, then shall I bee weake, and be as an other man."
7,16,8,"And the princes of the Philistims brought her seuen greene cordes that were not dry, and she bound him therewith."
7,16,9,"Now [there were]"
7,16,10,"And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now"
7,16,11,"Then he answered her, If they binde mee with newe ropes that neuer were occupied, then shal I be weake, and be as an other man."
7,16,12,"Delilah therefore tooke newe ropes, and bounde him therewith, and saide vnto him, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson: (and men lay in wayte in the chamber) and hee brake them from his armes, as a threede."
7,16,13,"And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound."
7,16,14,"And she fastened it with a pinne, and saide vnto him, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson; he awoke out of his sleepe, and went away with the pinne of the webbe and the woufe."
7,16,15,"And she said unto him, How canst thou say,"
7,16,16,"And because shee was importunate vpon him with her wordes continually, and vexed him, his soule was pained vnto the death."
7,16,17,"That he told her all his"

7,16,19,"And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went"
7,16,20,"Then she said, The Philistims be vpon thee, Samson; hee awoke out of his sleepe, and thought, I will go out now as at other times, and shake my selfe, but he knewe not that the Lorde was departed from him."
7,16,21,"Therefore the Philistims tooke him, and put out his eyes, and brought him downe to Azzah, and bounde him with fetters: and hee did grinde in the prison house."
7,16,22,"Howbeit the hair of his head began to"
7,16,23,"Then the Princes of the Philistims gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice vnto Dagon their god, and to reioyce: for they said, Our god hath deliuered Samson our enemie into our handes."
7,16,24,"Also when the people saw him, they praysed their god: for they sayde, Our god hath deliuered into our hands our enemie and destroyer of our countrey, which hath slayne many of vs."
7,16,25,"And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he"
7,16,26,"Then Samson saide vnto the seruant that led him by the hande, Lead me, that I may touch the pillars that the house standeth vpon, and that I may leane to them."
7,16,27,"(Nowe the house was full of men and women, and there were all the princes of the Philistims: also vpon the roofe were about three thousande men and women that behelde while Samson played)"
7,16,28,"And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once"
7,16,29,"And Samson layd hold on the two middle pillars whereupon the house stood, and on which it was borne vp: on the one with his right hand, and on the other with his left."
7,16,30,"And Samson said,"
7,16,31,"Then his brethren, and all the house of his father came downe and tooke him, and brought him vp and buryed him betweene Zorah & Eshtaol, in the sepulchre of Manoah his father: nowe he had iudged Israel twenty yeeres."
7,17,1,"And there"
7,17,2,"And he saide vnto his mother, The eleuen hundreth shekels of siluer that were taken from thee, for the which thou cursedst, and spakedst it, euen in mine hearing, beholde, the siluer is with me, I tooke it. Then his mother saide, Blessed be my sonne of the Lorde."
7,17,3,"And when he had restored the eleven hundred [shekels] of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a"
7,17,4,"And when he had restored the money vnto his mother, his mother tooke two hundreth shekels of siluer, and gaue them to the founder, which made thereof a grauen and molten image, and it was in the house of Michah."
7,17,5,"And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an"

7,17,9,"And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him,"
7,17,10,"Then Michah said vnto him, Dwell with me, and be vnto me a father and a Priest, and I will giue thee ten shekels of siluer by yeere, and a sute of apparell, and thy meate and drinke. So the Leuite went in."
7,17,11,"And the Levite was"
7,17,12,"And Michah consecrated the Leuite, and the yong man was his Priest, and was in the house of Michah."
7,17,13,"Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me"
7,18,1,"In those days [there was] no"
7,18,2,"And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them,"
7,18,3,"When they [were] by the house of Micah, they knew the"
7,18,4,"And he answered them, Thus and thus dealeth Michah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his Priest."
7,18,5,"Againe they said vnto him, Aske counsell nowe of God, that we may knowe whether the way which we goe, shalbe prosperous."
7,18,6,"And the priest said unto them,"
7,18,7,"Then the fiue men departed and came to Laish, and sawe the people that were therein, which dwelt carelesse, after the maner of the Zidonians, quiet and sure, because no man made any trouble in the lande, or vsurped any dominion: also they were farre from the Zidonians, and had no businesse with other men."
7,18,8,"So they came againe vnto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren saide vnto them, What haue ye done?"
7,18,9,"And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it [is] very good: and"
7,18,10,"(If ye will goe, ye shall come vnto a carelesse people, and the countrey is large) for God hath giuen it into your hande. It is a place which doeth lacke nothing that is in the worlde."
7,18,11,"Then there departed thence of the familie of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, sixe hundreth men appointed with instruments of warre."
7,18,12,"And they went vp, and pitched in Kiriath-iearim in Iudah: wherefore they called that place, Mahaneh-Dan vnto this day: and it is behinde Kiriath-iearim."
7,18,13,"And they went thence vnto mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Michah."
7,18,14,"Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren,"
7,18,15,"And they turned thitherward & came to the house of the yong man the Leuite, euen vnto the house of Michah, and saluted him peaceably."
7,18,16,"And the six hundreth men appointed with their weapons of warre, which were of the children of Dan, stoode by the entring of the gate."
7,18,17,"And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, [and] came in thither, [and] took the"
7,18,18,"And the other went into Michahs house and fet the grauen image, the Ephod, and the Teraphim, and the molten image. Then saide the Priest vnto them, What doe ye?"
7,18,19,"And they answered him, Holde thy peace: lay thine hande vpon thy mouth, and come with vs to be our father and Priest. Whether is it better that thou shouldest be a Priest vnto ye house of one man, or that thou shouldest be a Priest vnto a tribe and to a familie in Israel?"
7,18,20,"And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the"
7,18,21,"So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage"
7,18,22,"When they were farre off from the house of Michah, the men that were in the houses neere to Michahs house, gathered together, and pursued after the children of Dan,"
7,18,23,"And cryed vnto the children of Dan: who turned their faces, and said vnto Michah, What ayleth thee, that thou makest an outcrie?"
7,18,24,"And he said, Ye have taken away my"
7,18,25,"And the children of Dan sayde vnto him, Let not thy voyce be heard among vs, least angrie fellowes runne vpon thee, and thou lose thy life with the liues of thine housholde."
7,18,26,"So the children of Dan went their wayes: and when Michah saw that they were too strong for him, hee turned, and went backe vnto his house."
7,18,27,"And they took [the"
7,18,28,"And there was none to helpe, because Laish was farre from Zidon, and they had no businesse with other men: also it was in the valley that lyeth by Beth-rehob. After, they built the citie, and dwelt therein,"
7,18,29,"And called the name of the citie Dan, after the name of Dan their father which was borne vnto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the beginning."
7,18,30,"And the children of Dan set up the"
7,18,31,"So they set them vp the grauen image, which Michah had made, all the while the house of God was in Shiloh."
7,19,1,"Also in those dayes, when there was no king in Israel, a certaine Leuite dwelt on the side of mount Ephraim, and tooke to wife a concubine out of Beth-lehem Iudah,"
7,19,2,"And his concubine played ye whore there, and went away from him vnto her fathers house to Beth-lehem Iudah, and there continued the space of foure moneths."
7,19,3,"And her husband arose and went after her, to speake friendly vnto her, and to bring her againe: he had also his seruant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him vnto her fathers house, and when the yong womans father sawe him, he reioyced of his coming."
7,19,4,"And his father in lawe, the yong womans father reteined him: & he abode with him three dayes: so they did eate & drinke, & lodged there."
7,19,5,"And when the fourth day came, they arose earely in the morning, and he prepared to depart: then the yong womans father said vnto his sonne in lawe, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and then go your way."
7,19,6,"And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the"
7,19,7,"And when the man rose vp to depart, his father in lawe was earnest: therefore he returned, and lodged there."
7,19,8,"And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said,"
7,19,9,"And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go"
7,19,10,"But the man would not tarry, but arose & departed, and came ouer against Iebus, (which is Ierusalem) and his two asses laden, and his concubine were with him."
7,19,11,"When they were neere to Iebus, the day was sore spent, and the seruant said vnto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let vs turne into this citie of the Iebusites, and lodge all night there."
7,19,12,"And his master said unto him,"
7,19,13,"And he said vnto his seruant, Come, and let vs drawe neere to one of these places, that wee may lodge in Gibeah or in Ramah."
7,19,14,"So they went forward vpon their way, and the sunne went downe vpon them neere to Gibeah, which is in Beniamin."
7,19,15,"Then they turned thither to goe in and lodge in Gibeah: and when he came, he sate him downe in a streete of the citie: for there was no man that tooke them into his house to lodging."
7,19,16,"And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which [was] also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place [were]"
7,19,17,"And when he had lift vp his eyes, he sawe a wayfairing man in the streetes of the citie: then this olde man sayde, Whither goest thou, and whence camest thou?"
7,19,18,"And he said unto him, We [are] passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence [am] I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I [am now] going to the"
7,19,19,"Although we haue straw and prouader for our asses, and also bread and wine for me & thine handmayde, and for the boy that is with thy seruant: we lacke nothing."
7,19,20,"And the olde man sayde, Peace bee with thee: as for all that thou lackest, shalt thou finde with me: onely abide not in the streete al night."
7,19,21,"So he brought him into his house, & gaue fodder vnto the asses: and they washed their feete, and did eate and drinke."
7,19,22,"[Now] as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, [and]"
7,19,23,"And this man the master of ye house went out vnto the, & said vnto them, Nay my brethre, do not so wickedly, I pray you: seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this villenie."
7,19,24,"Behold, [here is] my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now,"
7,19,25,"But the men woulde not hearken to him: therefore ye man tooke his concubine, & brought her out vnto them: and they knewe her and abused her all the night vnto the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her goe."
7,19,26,"Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and"
7,19,27,"And her lorde arose in the morning, and opened the doores of the house, and went out to goe his way, and beholde, the woman his concubine was dead at the doore of the house and her handes lay vpon the thresholde."
7,19,28,"And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her [up] upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his"
7,19,29,"And whe he was come to his house, he took a knife, and laid hand on his concubine, and deuided her in pieces with her bones into twelue parts, and sent her through all quarters of Israel."

7,20,3,"(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then"
7,20,4,"And the same Leuite, the womans husband that was slaine, answered and saide, I came vnto Gibeah that is in Beniamin with my concubine to lodge,"
7,20,5,"And the men of Gibeah arose against me, and beset the house round about vpon mee by night, thinking to haue slaine me, and haue forced my concubine that she is dead."
7,20,6,"And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent"
7,20,7,"Behold, ye are al children of Israel: giue your aduise, and counsell herein."

7,20,14,"But ye children of Beniamin gathered them selues together out of the cities vnto Gibeah, to come out and fight against the children of Israel."
7,20,15,"And ye children of Beniamin were nombred at that time out of the cities sixe and twenty thousand men that drewe sworde, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were nombred seuen hundreth chosen men."
7,20,16,"Of all this people were seuen hundreth chosen men, being left handed: all these could sling stones at an heare breadth, and not faile."
7,20,17,"Also the men of Israel, beside Beniamin, were nombred foure hundreth thousande men that drew sword, euen all men of warre."
7,20,18,"And the children of Israel arose, and went up"
7,20,19,"Then the children of Israel arose vp earely and camped against Gibeah."
7,20,20,"And the men of Israel went out to battell against Beniamin, & the men of Israel put themselues in aray to fight against the beside Gibeah."
7,20,21,"And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day"
7,20,22,"And the people, the men of Israel plucked vp their hearts, and set their battel againe in aray in the place where they put them in aray the first day."
7,20,23,"(For the children of Israel had gone vp and wept before the Lord vnto the euening, and had asked of the Lorde, saying, Shall I goe againe to battel against the children of Beniamin my brethren? and the Lord said, Go vp against them)"
7,20,24,"Then the children of Israel came neere against the children of Beniamin the second day."
7,20,25,"Also the second day Beniamin came forth to meete them out of Gibeah, and slewe downe to the grounde of the children of Israel againe eighteene thousand men: all they could handle the sword."
7,20,26,"Then al the children of Israel went vp and all the people came also vnto the house of God, and wept and sate there before the Lord & fasted that day vnto the euening, and offred burnt offrings and peace offrings before the Lord."
7,20,27,"And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God [was]"

7,20,29,"And Israel set men to lie in waite round about Gibeah."
7,20,30,"And the children of Israel went vp against the children of Beniamin the third day, and put theselues in aray against Gibeah, as at other times."
7,20,31,"And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, [and] were"

7,20,35,"And the Lord smote Beniamin before Israel, and the children of Israel destroyed of the Beniamites the same day fiue and twenty thousand and an hundreth men: all they could handle the sword."
7,20,36,"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel"
7,20,37,"And they that lay in wait hasted, and brake forth toward Gibeah, & the ambushment drewe themselues along, and smote all the citie with the edge of the sword."
7,20,38,"Also the men of Israel had appoynted a certaine time with the ambushmentes, that they should make a great flame and smoke rise vp out of the citie."
7,20,39,"And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to"

7,20,41,"And when the men of Israel turned"
7,20,42,"Therefore they turned [their backs] before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which [came] out of the cities they destroyed"
7,20,43,"Thus they compassed the Beniamites about, and chased them at ease, and ouerranne them, euen ouer against Gibeah on the Eastside."
7,20,44,"And there were slaine of Beniamin eyghteene thousad men, which were all men of warre."
7,20,45,"And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they"

7,21,6,"And the children of Israel"
7,21,7,"How shal we do for wiues to them that remaine, seeing we haue sworne by the Lorde, that we will not giue them of our daughters to wiues?"
7,21,8,"And they said, What one [is there] of the tribes of Israel that"

7,21,10,"Therefore the Congregation sent thither twelue thousande men of the most valiant, and commaunded them, saying, Goe, and smite the inhabitants of Iabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, both women, and children."
7,21,11,"And this is it that ye shall do: ye shall vtterly destroye all the males and all the women that haue lien by men."
7,21,12,"And they found among the inhabitants of Iabesh Gilead foure hundreth maides, virgins that had knowne no man by lying with any male: and they brought them vnto the hoste to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan."
7,21,13,"And the whole congregation"

7,21,15,"And the people were sorie for Beniamin, because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel."
7,21,16,"Therefore the Elders of the Congregation said, How shall we doe for wiues to the remnant? for the women of Beniamin are destroyed."
7,21,17,"And they said, [There must be]"

7,21,22,"And it shall be,"
7,21,23,"And the children of Benjamin did so, and took [them] wives, according to their"

8,1,3,"Then Elimelech the husbande of Naomi died, and she remayned with her two sonnes,"
8,1,4,"And they took them wives of the"
8,1,5,"And Mahlon and Chilion dyed also both twaine: so the woman was left destitute of her two sonnes, and of her husband."
8,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had"
8,1,7,"Wherefore shee departed out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her, and they went on their way to returne vnto the land of Iudah."
8,1,8,"Then Naomi saide vnto her two daughters in lawe, Goe, returne eche of you vnto her owne mothers house: the Lord shew fauour vnto you, as ye haue done with the dead, and with me."
8,1,9,"The LORD grant you that ye may find"
8,1,10,"And they saide vnto her, Surely we will returne with thee vnto thy people."
8,1,11,"But Naomi saide, Turne againe, my daughters: for what cause will you go with me? are there any mo sonnes in my wombe, that they may bee your husbands?"
8,1,12,"Turne againe, my daughters: go your way: for I am too olde to haue an husband. If I should say, I haue hope, and if I had an husbad this night: yea, if I had borne sonnes,"
8,1,13,"Would yee tarie for them, till they were of age? would ye be deferred for them from taking of husbands? nay my daughters: for it grieueth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lorde is gone out against me."
8,1,14,"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah"
8,1,15,"And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods:"
8,1,16,"And Ruth answered, Intreate mee not to leaue thee, nor to depart from thee: for whither thou goest, I will goe: and where thou dwellest, I will dwell: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God."
8,1,17,"Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried. the Lord do so to me and more also, if ought but death depart thee and me."
8,1,18,"Whe she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left speaking vnto her."
8,1,19,"So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was"
8,1,20,"And she answered them, Call me not Naomi, but call me Mara: for the Almightie hath giuen me much bitternes."
8,1,21,"I went out full, and the Lorde hath caused me to returne emptie: why call ye me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath humbled me, and the Almightie hath brought me vnto aduersitie?"
8,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of"

8,2,4,"And behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and saide vnto the reapers, The Lord be with you: and they answered him, The Lord blesse thee."
8,2,5,"Then saide Boaz vnto his seruant that was appointed ouer the reapers, Whose maide is this?"
8,2,6,"And the seruant that was appointed ouer the reapers, answered, and said, It is the Moabitish maide, that came with Naomi out of the countrey of Moab:"
8,2,7,"And shee saide vnto vs, I pray you, let mee gleane and gather after the reapers among the sheaues: so shee came, and hath continued from that time in the morning vnto now, saue that she taried a litle in the house."
8,2,8,"Then said Boaz vnto Ruth, Hearest thou, my daughter? goe to none other fielde to gather, neither goe from hence: but abide here by my maydens."
8,2,9,""
8,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I [am] a"

8,2,14,"And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched [corn], and she did eat, and was sufficed, and"
8,2,15,"And when she arose to gleane, Boaz commanded his seruants, saying, Let her gather among the sheaues, and doe not rebuke her."
8,2,16,"Also let fall some of the sheaues for her, and let it lie, that she may gather it vp, & rebuke her not."
8,2,17,"So she gleaned in the fielde vntill euening, and she thresshed that shee had gathered, and it was about an Ephah of barly."
8,2,18,"And she took [it] up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she"
8,2,19,"Then her mother in lawe saide vnto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he, that knewe thee; she shewed her mother in lawe, with whome she had wrought, and saide, The mans name, with whom I wrought to day, is Boaz."
8,2,20,"And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed [be] he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the"
8,2,21,"And Ruth the Moabitesse said, He said also certainely vnto mee, Thou shalt be with my seruants, vntill they haue ended all mine haruest."
8,2,22,"And Naomi answered vnto Ruth her daughter in lawe, It is best, my daughter, that thou goe out with his maides, that they meete thee not in an other fielde."
8,2,23,"Then she kept her by the maides of Boaz, to gather vnto the end of barly haruest, and of wheate haruest, and dwelt with her mother in lawe."
8,3,1,"Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek"
8,3,2,"Now also is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maides thou wast? beholde, he winoweth barly to night in the floore."
8,3,3,"Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: [but] make not thyself known unto the"

8,3,5,"And she answered her, All that thou biddest me, I will doe."
8,3,6,"So she went downe vnto the floore, and did according to all that her mother in lawe bade her."
8,3,7,"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his"

8,3,9,"Then he sayd, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmayd: spread therefore the wing of thy garment ouer thine handmayd: for thou art the kinsman."
8,3,10,"And he said, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD, my daughter: [for] thou hast"
8,3,11,"And now, my daughter, feare not: I will doe to thee all that thou requirest: for all the citie of my people doeth knowe, that thou art a vertuous woman."

8,3,15,"Also he sayd, Bring the sheete that thou hast vpon thee, and holde it; when she helde it, he measured sixe measures of barly, and layde them on her, and she went into the citie."
8,3,16,"And when she came to her mother in law, she said,"
8,3,17,"And said, These sixe measures of barly gaue he me: for he sayd to me, Thou shalt not come emptie vnto thy mother in lawe."
8,3,18,"Then sayd she, My daughter, sit still, vntill thou knowe how the thing will fall: for the man wil not be in rest, vntill he hath finished the matter this same day."
8,4,1,"Then went Boaz up to the"

8,4,3,"And he said vnto ye kinsman, Naomi, that is come againe out of ye countrey of Moab, wil sell a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelechs."
8,4,4,"And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy [it] before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem [it], redeem [it]: but if thou wilt not redeem [it, then] tell me, that I may know: for [there is] none to redeem [it]"
8,4,5,"Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy [it] also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his"
8,4,6,"And the kinsman answered, I can not redeeme it, lest I destroy mine owne inheritance: redeeme my right to thee, for I can not redeeme it."
8,4,7,"Now this [was the manner] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave [it] to his neighbour: and this [was] a"
8,4,8,"Therefore the kinsman sayd to Boas, Buy it for thee: and he drew off his shooe."
8,4,9,"And Boaz sayd vnto the Elders & vnto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I haue bought all that was Elimelechs, and all that was Chilions and Mahlons, of the hand of Naomi."
8,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his"
8,4,11,"And all the people that [were] in the gate, and the elders, said, [We are] witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in"
8,4,12,"And that thine house be like the house of Pharez ( whom Thamar bare vnto Iudah) of the seede which the Lord shall giue thee of this yong woman."
8,4,13,"So Boaz tooke Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in vnto her, the Lorde gaue that she conceiued, and bare a sonne."
8,4,14,"And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed [be] the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that"

8,4,16,"And Naomi tooke the childe, and layde it in her lap, and became nource vnto it."
8,4,17,"And the women her neighbours gaue it a name, saying, There is a childe borne to Naomi, and called the name thereof Obed: the same was the father of Ishai, the father of Dauid."
8,4,18,"Now these [are] the generations of"
8,4,19,"And Hezron begate Ram, & Ram begate Amminadab,"
8,4,20,"And Amminadab begate Nahshon, and Nahshon begate Salmah,"
8,4,21,"And Salmon begate Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,"
8,4,22,"And Obed begate Ishai, and Ishai begate Dauid."
9,1,1,"Now there was a certain man of"
9,1,2,"And he had two wiues: the name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."
9,1,3,"And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in"

9,1,12,"And as she continued praying before the Lord, Eli marked her mouth."
9,1,13,"For Hannah spake in her heart: her lips did moue onely, but her voyce was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had bene drunken."
9,1,14,"And Eli sayde vnto her, Howe long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy drunkennesse from thee."
9,1,15,"Then Hannah answered and sayd, Nay my lord, but I am a woman troubled in spirit: I haue drunke neither wine nor strong drinke, but haue powred out my soule before the Lord."
9,1,16,"Count not thine handmaide for a wicked woman: for of the abundance of my complaint and my griefe haue I spoken hitherto."
9,1,17,"Then Eli answered, and sayd, Go in peace, and the God of Israel graunt thy petition that thou hast asked of him."
9,1,18,"And she said, Let thine handmaid find"

9,1,21,"And the man"

9,1,23,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his"
9,1,24,"And when she had weined him, she tooke him with her with three bullockes and an Ephah of floure and a bottell of wine, and brought him vnto the house of the Lorde in Shiloh, and the childe was yong."
9,1,25,"And they slewe a bullocke, and brought the childe to Eli."
9,1,26,"And she said, Oh my lord, [as] thy"
9,1,27,"I prayed for this childe, and the Lord hath giuen me my desire which I asked of him."
9,1,28,"Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he"

9,3,21,"And the Lorde appeared againe in Shiloh: for the Lorde reueiled himselfe to Samuel in Shiloh by his word."
9,4,1,"And Samuel spake vnto all Israel: and Israel went out against the Philistims to battel and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistims pitched in Aphek."
9,4,2,"And the Philistims put themselues in aray against Israel: and when they ioyned the battell, Israel was smitten downe before the Philistims: who slewe of the armie in the fielde about foure thousand men."

9,4,6,"And when the Philistims heard the noyse of the shoute, they said, What meaneth the sound of this mightie shoute in the host of the Ebrewes? and they vnderstoode, that the Arke of the Lord was come into the hoste."
9,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said,"

9,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel"
9,4,11,"And the Arke of God was taken, and the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas died."
9,4,12,"And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes"
9,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart"
9,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noyse of the crying, he sayd, What meaneth this noyse of the tumult? and the man came in hastily, and tolde Eli."
9,4,15,"(Nowe Eli was fourescore and eighteene yeere olde, and his eyes were dimme that hee could not see)"
9,4,16,"And the man sayd vnto Eli, I came from the armie, and I fled this day out of the hoste: and he sayd, What thing is done, my sonne?"
9,4,17,"And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas,"
9,4,18,"And when he had made mention of the Arke of God, Eli fell from his seate backward by the side of the gate, and his necke was broken, and he dyed: for he was an olde man and heauie: and he had iudged Israel fourtie yeeres."
9,4,19,"And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, [near] to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she"
9,4,20,"And about the time of her death, the women that stoode about her, sayd vnto her, Feare not: for thou hast borne a sonne: but she answered not, nor regarded it."
9,4,21,"And she named the childe Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel, because the Arke of God was taken, and because of her father in lawe and her husband."
9,4,22,"And she said,"
9,5,1,"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto"

9,5,4,"Also they rose vp earely in the morning the next day, and beholde, Dagon was fallen vpon his face on the ground before the Arke of the Lord, and the head of Dagon and the two palmes of his hands were cut off vpon the thresholde: onely the stumpe of Dagon was left to him."
9,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house,"
9,5,6,"But the hand of the Lord was heauie vpon them of Ashdod, and destroyed them, and smote them with the emerods, both Ashdod, and the coastes thereof."
9,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod sawe this, they sayd, Let not the Arke of the God of Israel abide with vs: for his hand is sore vpon vs and vpon Dagon our god."
9,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said,"
9,5,9,"And when they had caried it about, the hand of the Lord was against the citie with a very great destruction, and he smote the men of the citie both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret partes."
9,5,10,"Therefore they sent the Arke of God to Ekron: and assoone as the Arke of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cryed out, saying, They haue brought the Arke of the God of Israel to vs to slay vs and our people."
9,5,11,"So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send"
9,5,12,"And the men that dyed not, were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the citie went vp to heauen."
9,6,1,"And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines"
9,6,2,"And the Philistims called the priests and the soothsayers, saying, What shall we doe with the Arke of the Lord? tell vs wherewith we shall send it home againe."
9,6,3,"And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him"
9,6,4,"Then sayd they, What shalbe the sinne offring, which we shall giue vnto it? And they answered, Fiue golden emerods and fiue golden mise, according to the number of the princes of the Philistims: for one plague was on you all, and on your princes."
9,6,5,"Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your"
9,6,6,"Wherefore then should ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let them goe, and they departed?"
9,6,7,"Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on whome there hath come no yoke: and tye the kine to the cart, and bring the calues home from them."
9,6,8,"And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the"
9,6,9,"And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, [then]"
9,6,10,"And the men did so: for they tooke two kine that gaue milke, and tied them to the cart, and shut the calues at home."
9,6,11,"So they set the Arke of the Lord vpon the cart, and the coffer with the mise of golde, and with the similitudes of their emerods."
9,6,12,"And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, [and] went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside [to] the right hand or [to] the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after"
9,6,13,"Nowe they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheate haruest in the valley, and they lift vp their eyes, and spied the Arke, and reioyced when they sawe it."
9,6,14,"And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where [there was] a great stone: and"
9,6,15,"And the Leuites tooke downe the Arke of the Lord, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the iewels of golde were, and put them on the great stone, and the men of Beth-shemesh offred burnt offring, and sacrificed sacrifices that same day vnto the Lord."
9,6,16,"And when the fiue Princes of ye Philistims had seene it, they returned to Ekron the same day."
9,6,17,"And these [are] the golden emerods which the Philistines returned [for] a trespass offering unto the LORD; for"
9,6,18,"And golden mise, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistims, belonging to the fiue princes, both of walled townes, and of townes vnwalled, vnto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set the Arke of the Lorde: which stone remaineth vnto this day in the fielde of Ioshua the Beth-shemite."
9,6,19,"And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they"
9,6,20,"Wherefore the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God? and to whom shall he go from vs?"
9,6,21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitans of Kiriath-iearim, saying, The Philistims haue brought againe the Arke of the Lord: come ye downe and take it vp to you."
9,7,1,"And the men of"
9,7,2,"And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented"
9,7,3,"Then Samuel spake vnto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye be come againe vnto the Lord with all your heart, put away the strange gods from among you, and Ashtaroth, & direct your hearts vnto the Lord, & serue him only, and he shall deliuer you out of the hand of ye Philistims."
9,7,4,"Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim & Ashtaroth, & serued the Lord onely."
9,7,5,"And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to"
9,7,6,"And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and"
9,7,7,"When the Philistims heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the princes of the Philistims went vp against Israel: and when the children of Israel heard that, they were afraide of the Philistims."
9,7,8,"And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to"
9,7,9,"Then Samuel tooke a sucking lambe, and offered it all together for a burnt offering vnto the Lord, and Samuel cryed vnto the Lord for Israel, and the Lord heard him."
9,7,10,"And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD"
9,7,11,"And the men of Israel went from Mizpeh and pursued the Philistims, and smote them vntill they came vnder Beth-car."
9,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone, and set [it] between Mizpeh and"
9,7,13,"So the Philistims were brought vnder, and they came no more againe into the coastes of Israel: and the hand of the Lorde was against the Philistims all the dayes of Samuel."
9,7,14,"And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the"
9,7,15,"And Samuel iudged Israel all the dayes of his life,"
9,7,16,"And went about yeere by yere to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and iudged Israel in all those places."
9,7,17,"And his return [was] to Ramah; for there [was] his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an"
9,8,1,"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he"
9,8,2,"Now the name of his firstborn was"
9,8,3,"And his sonnes walked not in his wayes, but turned aside after lucre, and tooke rewards, and peruerted the iudgement."
9,8,4,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto"
9,8,5,"And said vnto him, Beholde, thou art olde, and thy sonnes walke not in thy wayes: make vs nowe a King to iudge vs like all nations."
9,8,6,"But the thing"
9,8,7,"And the Lord said vnto Samuel, Heare the voyce of the people in all that they shall say vnto thee: for they haue not cast thee away, but they haue cast me away, that I should not reigne ouer the."
9,8,8,"As they haue euer done since I brought them out of Egypt euen vnto this day, (and haue forsaken me, and serued other gods) euen so doe they vnto thee."
9,8,9,"Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet"
9,8,10,"So Samuel told all the wordes of the Lord vnto the people that asked a King of him."
9,8,11,"And he said, This will be the"
9,8,12,"Also he will make them his captaines ouer thousands, and captaines ouer fifties, and to eare his ground, and to reape his haruest, and to make instruments of warre, and the thinges that serue for his charets."
9,8,13,"He will also take your daughters and make them apoticaries, and cookes, and bakers."
9,8,14,"And he will take your fieldes, & your vineyardes, and your best Oliue trees, and giue them to his seruants."
9,8,15,"And he will take the tenth of your seede, and of your vineyards, & giue it to his Eunuches, and to his seruants."
9,8,16,"And he will take your men seruants, and your maide seruants, and the chiefe of your yong men, and your asses, and put them to his worke."
9,8,17,"He will take the tenth of your sheepe, and ye shall be his seruants."
9,8,18,"And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not"
9,8,19,"But the people would not heare the voyce of Samuel, but did say, Nay, but there shall be a King ouer vs."
9,8,20,"And we also will be like all other nations, and our King shall iudge vs, and goe out before vs, and fight our battels."
9,8,21,"Therefore when Samuel heard all ye wordes of ye people, he rehearsed the in ye eares of ye Lord."
9,8,22,"And the Lord saide to Samuel, Hearken vnto their voyce, and make them a King; Samuel said vnto the men of Israel, Goe euery man vnto his citie."
9,9,1,"Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name [was] Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a"

9,9,7,"Then saide Saul to his seruant, Well then, let vs goe: but what shall we bring vnto the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is no present to bring to the man of God: what haue we?"
9,9,8,"And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a"

9,9,11,"And as they were going vp the hie way to the citie, they found maydes that came out to draw water, & said vnto them, Is there here a Seer?"
9,9,12,"And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for [there is] a"

9,9,14,"Then they went vp into the citie, & when they were come into the middes of the citie, Samuel came out against them, to goe vp to the hie place."
9,9,15,"But the Lord had reueiled to Samuel secretly (a day before Saul came) saying,"

9,9,17,"When Samuel therefore sawe Saul, the Lord answered him, See, this is the man whom I spake to thee of, he shall rule my people."
9,9,18,"Then went Saul to Samuel in the middes of the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the Seers house is."
9,9,19,"And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I [am] the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that [is] in thine"
9,9,20,"And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And"
9,9,21,"But Saul answered, and said, Am not I the sonne of Iemini of the smallest tribe of Israel? and my familie is the least of all the families of the tribe of Beniamin. Wherefore then speakest thou so to me?"
9,9,22,"And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the"

9,9,24,"And the cook took up the shoulder, and [that] which [was]"
9,9,25,"And when they were come downe from the hie place into the citie, he communed with Saul vpon the top of the house."
9,9,26,"And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the"
9,9,27,"[And] as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee"

9,10,4,"And they will aske thee if all be well, and will giue thee the two loaues of bread, which thou shalt receiue of their handes."
9,10,5,"After that thou shalt come to the"

9,10,9,"And it was [so], that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another"

9,10,11,"Therefore all the people that knewe him before, when they saw that he prophecied among the Prophets, saide eche to other, What is come vnto the sonne of Kish? is Saul also among the Prophets?"
9,10,12,"And one of the same place answered and said, But who [is] their"
9,10,13,"And when he had made an ende of prophecying, he came to the hie place."
9,10,14,"And Sauls vncle saide vnto him, and to his seruant, Whither went ye? And he saide, To seeke the asses: and when we sawe that they were no where, we came to Samuel."
9,10,15,"And Sauls vncle saide, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said vnto you."
9,10,16,"Then Saul saide to his vncle, He tolde vs plainely that the asses were founde: but concerning the kingdome whereof Samuel spake, tolde he him not."
9,10,17,"And Samuel"
9,10,18,"And he saide vnto the children of Israel, Thus saith ye Lord God of Israel, I haue brought Israel out of Egypt, and deliuered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the handes of all kingdomes that troubled you."
9,10,19,"But ye haue this day cast away your God, who onely deliuereth you out of all your aduersities and tribulations: and ye said vnto him, No, but appoint a King ouer vs. Nowe therefore stand ye before the Lord according to your tribes, and according to your thousands."
9,10,20,"And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was"
9,10,21,"Afterwarde he assembled the tribe of Beniamin according to their families, and the familie of Matri was taken. So Saul the sonne of Kish was taken, and when they sought him, he coulde not be found."
9,10,22,"Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he"
9,10,23,"And they ranne, and brought him thence: and when he stoode among the people, he was hier then any of the people from the shoulders vpwarde."
9,10,24,"And Samuel saide to all the people, See ye not him, whom the Lorde hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? and all the people shouted and saide, God saue the King."
9,10,25,"Then Samuel told the people"
9,10,26,"Saul also went home to Gibeah, and there followed him a bande of men, whose heart God had touched,"
9,10,27,"But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he"

9,11,5,"And behold, Saul came following the cattell out of the fielde, and Saul saide, What aileth this people, that they weepe? And they tolde him the tidings of the men of Iabesh."
9,11,6,"And the Spirit of God"

9,12,8,"After that Iaakob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried vnto the Lorde, then the Lorde sent Moses and Aaron which brought your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place."
9,12,9,"And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera,"
9,12,10,"And they cried vnto the Lorde, and saide, We haue sinned, because we haue forsaken the Lorde, and haue serued Baalim and Ashtaroth. Nowe therefore deliuer vs out of the handes of our enemies, and we will serue thee."
9,12,11,"And the LORD sent Jerubbaal,"
9,12,12,"And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me,"

9,13,17,"And there came out of the hoste of the Philistims three bandes to destroie, one bande turned vnto the way of Ophrah vnto the lande of Shual,"
9,13,18,"And another company turned the way [to] Bethhoron: and"
9,13,19,"Then there was no smith founde throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistims sayde, Lest the Ebrewes make them swordes or speares."
9,13,20,"Wherefore all ye Israelites went downe to the Philistims, to sharpen euery man his share, his mattocke, and his axe, and his weeding hooke."
9,13,21,"Yet they had a file for the shares, and for the mattockes, and for the picke forkes, and for the axes, and for to sharpen the goades."
9,13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither"

9,14,20,"And Saul was assembled with all the people that were with him, and they came to the battell: and behold, euery mans sworde was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture."
9,14,21,"Moreover the Hebrews [that] were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp [from the country] round about, even they also [turned] to be with the"
9,14,22,"Also all the men of Israel which had hid themselues in mount Ephraim, when they heard, that the Philistims were fled, they followed after them in the battell."
9,14,23,"And so the Lord saued Israel that day: and the battell continued vnto Beth-auen."
9,14,24,"And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying,"
9,14,25,"And all they of the land came to a wood, where hony lay vpon the ground."
9,14,26,"And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the"

9,14,28,"Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father made the people to sweare, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth sustenance this day: and the people were faint."
9,14,29,"Then said Jonathan, My father hath"
9,14,30,"Howe much more, if the people had eaten to day of the spoyle of their enemies which they found? for had there not bene nowe a greater slaughter among the Philistims?"
9,14,31,"And they smote the Philistims that day, from Michmash to Aiialon: and the people were exceeding faint."
9,14,32,"So the people turned to the spoile, & tooke sheepe, and oxen, and calues, and slewe them on the ground, and the people did eate them with the blood."
9,14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed:"
9,14,34,"Againe Saul said, Goe abroade among the people, and bid them bring me euery man his oxe, and euery man his sheepe, and slay them here, and eate and sinne not against the Lord in eating with the blood; ye people brought euery man his oxe in his hand that night, & slew them there."
9,14,35,"Then Saul made an altar vnto the Lorde, and that was the first altar that he made vnto the Lord."
9,14,36,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us"
9,14,37,"So Saul asked of God, saying, Shall I goe downe after ye Philistims? wilt thou deliuer them into the hands of Israel? But he answered him not at that time."
9,14,38,"And Saul said, All ye chiefe of the people, come ye hither, and knowe, and see by whom this sinne is done this day."
9,14,39,"For as the Lord liueth, which saueth Israel, though it be done by Ionathan my sonne, he shall dye the death. But none of all the people answered him."
9,14,40,"Then he saide vnto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Ionathan my sonne will be on the other side; the people saide vnto Saul, Doe what thou thinkest best."
9,14,41,"Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give"
9,14,42,"And Saul saide, Cast lot betweene me and Ionathan my sonne; Ionathan was taken."
9,14,43,"Then Saul said to Ionathan, Tell me what thou hast done; Ionathan tolde him, & said, I tasted a litle hony with the ende of the rod, that was in mine hand, and loe, I must die."
9,14,44,"Againe Saul answered, God doe so & more also, vnlesse thou die the death, Ionathan."
9,14,45,"And the people said unto Saul,"
9,14,46,"Then Saul came vp from the Philistims: and the Philistims went to their owne place."
9,14,47,"So Saul helde the kingdome ouer Israel, and fought against all his enemies on euery side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the Kings of Zobah, and against the Philistims: and whithersoeuer he went, he handled them as wicked men."
9,14,48,"And he gathered an host, and smote the"
9,14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan,"
9,14,50,"And the name of Saul's wife [was] Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host [was]"
9,14,51,"And Kish was Sauls father: and Ner the father of Abner was the sonne of Abiel."
9,14,52,"And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul:"
9,15,1,"Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee [to be] king over his people, over Israel: now therefore"
9,15,2,"Thus saith the Lorde of hostes, I remember what Amalek did to Israel, howe they laide waite for the in ye way, as they came vp fro Egypt."
9,15,3,"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but"
9,15,4,"And Saul assembled ye people, and nombred them in Telaim, two hundreth thousande footemen, and ten thousand men of Iudah."
9,15,5,"And Saul came to a citie of Amalek, and set watch at the riuer."
9,15,6,"And Saul said unto the"
9,15,7,"So Saul smote the Amalekites from Hauilah as thou commest to Shur, that is before Egypt,"
9,15,8,"And tooke Agag the King of the Amalekites aliue, and destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword."
9,15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the better sheepe, and the oxen, and the fat beasts, and the lambes, and all that was good, and they would not destroy them: but euery thing that was vile and nought worth, that they destroyed."
9,15,10,"Then came the worde of the Lord vnto Samuel, saying,"
9,15,11,"It"
9,15,12,"And when Samuel arose early to meete Saul in the morning, one tolde Samuel, saying, Saul is gone to Carmel: and beholde, he hath made him there a place, from whence he returned, and departed, and is gone downe to Gilgal."
9,15,13,"And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD: I have performed the"
9,15,14,"But Samuel saide, What meaneth then the bleating of the sheepe in mine eares, and the lowing of the oxen which I heare?"
9,15,15,"And Saul answered, They haue brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheepe, and of the oxen to sacrifice them vnto the Lorde thy God, and the remnant haue we destroyed."
9,15,16,"Againe Samuel saide to Saul, Let me tell thee what the Lord hath saide to me this night; he said vnto him, Say on."
9,15,17,"And Samuel said, When thou [wast]"
9,15,18,"And the Lord sent thee on a iourney, and saide, Goe, and destroy those sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them, vntill thou destroy them."
9,15,19,"Nowe wherefore hast thou not obeyed the voyce of the Lorde, but hast turned to the pray, and hast done wickedly in the sight of the Lord?"
9,15,20,"And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea,"
9,15,21,"But the people tooke of the spoyle, sheepe, and oxen, and the chiefest of the things which shoulde haue bene destroyed, to offer vnto the Lord thy God in Gilgal."
9,15,22,"And Samuel saide, Hath the Lord as great pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as when the voyce of the Lord is obeyed? Beholde, to obey is better then sacrifice, and to hearken is better then the fatte of rammes."
9,15,23,"For"
9,15,24,"Then Saul sayde vnto Samuel, I haue sinned: for I haue transgressed the commaundement of the Lord, and thy wordes, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voyce."
9,15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my"
9,15,26,"But Samuel saide vnto Saul, I will not returne with thee: for thou hast cast away the word of the Lorde, and the Lorde hath cast away thee, that thou shalt not be King ouer Israel."
9,15,27,"And as Samuel turned himselfe to goe away, he caught the lappe of his coate, and it rent."
9,15,28,"And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a"
9,15,29,"And also the"
9,15,30,"Then he saide, I haue sinned: but honour mee, I pray thee, before the Elders of my people, and before Israel, and turne againe with mee, that I may worship the Lord thy God."
9,15,31,"So Samuel turned againe, and followed Saul: and Saul worshipped the Lord."
9,15,32,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the"
9,15,33,"And Samuel sayde, As thy sworde hath made women childlesse, so shall thy mother bee childelesse among other women; Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal."
9,15,34,"Then Samuel went to"
9,15,35,"And Samuel came no more to"
9,16,1,"And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,"
9,16,2,"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear [it], he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come"
9,16,3,"And call Ishai to the sacrifice, and I will shewe thee what thou shalt doe, and thou shalt anoynt vnto me him whom I name vnto thee."
9,16,4,"And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town"
9,16,5,"And he answeared, Yea: I am come to doe sacrifice vnto the Lorde: sanctifie your selues, and come with me to the sacrifice; he sanctified Ishai & his sonnes, & called them to the sacrifice."
9,16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S"
9,16,7,"But the Lord said vnto Samuel, Looke not on his countenance, nor on the height of his stature, because I haue refused him: for God seeth not as man seeth: for ma looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord beholdeth the heart."
9,16,8,"Then Ishai called Abinadab, & made him come before Samuel; he saide, Neither hath the Lord chosen this."
9,16,9,"Then Ishai made Shammah come; he said, Neither yet hath the Lorde chosen him."
9,16,10,"Againe Ishai made his seue sonnes to come before Samuel: and Samuel saide vnto Ishai, The Lord hath chosen none of these."
9,16,11,"Finally, Samuel said vnto Ishai, Are there no more children but these? And hee sayde, There remaineth yet a litle one behinde, that keepeth the sheepe. Then Samuel saide vnto Ishai, Sende and set him: for we will not sit downe, till he be come hither."
9,16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in: and he was ruddie, & of a good countenance, and comely visage; the Lorde saide, Arise, and anoynt him: for this is he."
9,16,13,"Then Samuel tooke the horne of oyle, and anoynted him in the middes of his brethren; the Spirit of the Lord came vpon Dauid, from that day forwarde: then Samuel rose vp, and went to Ramah."
9,16,14,"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an"
9,16,15,"And Sauls seruants said vnto him, Beholde nowe, the euill spirite of God vexeth thee."
9,16,16,"Let our Lord therefore command thy seruants, that are before thee, to seeke a man that is a cunning plaier vpon the harpe: that when the euil spirit of God commeth vpon thee, hee may play with his hand, and thou maiest be eased."
9,16,17,"Saul then saide vnto his seruantes, Prouide me a man, I pray you, that can play well, & bring him to me."
9,16,18,"Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a"
9,16,19,"Wherefore Saul sent messengers vnto Ishai, and said, Send me Dauid thy sonne which is with the sheepe."
9,16,20,"And Ishai tooke an asse laden with breade and a flagon of wine and a kidde, and sent them by the hand of Dauid his sonne vnto Saul."
9,16,21,"And Dauid came to Saul, and stoode before him: and he loued him verie well, and he was his armour bearer."
9,16,22,"And Saul sent to Ishai, saying, Let Dauid nowe remaine with me: for he hath found fauour in my sight."
9,16,23,"And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was"
9,17,1,"Nowe the Philistims gathered their armies to battell, & came together to Shochoh, which is in Iudah, and pitched betweene Shochoh and Azekah, in the coast of Dammim."
9,17,2,"And Saul, and the men of Israel assembled, and pitched in the valley of Elah, and put themselues in battell araie to meete the Philistims."
9,17,3,"And the Philistims stoode on a mountaine on the one side, and Israel stoode on a mountaine on the other side: so a valley was betweene them."
9,17,4,"And there"
9,17,5,"And [he had] an helmet of brass upon his head, and he [was] armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat [was] five thousand"
9,17,6,"And he had bootes of brasse vpon his legs, and a shield of brasse vpon his shoulders."
9,17,7,"And the shaft of his speare was like a weauers beame: and his speare head weyed sixe hundreth shekels of yron: and one bearing a shielde went before him."
9,17,8,"And he stoode, and cried against the hoste of Israel, and saide vnto them, Why are yee come to set your battell in aray? Am not I a Philistim, and you seruaunts to Saul? Chuse you a man for you, and let him come downe to me."
9,17,9,"If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then wil we be your seruants: but if I ouercome him, and kill him, then shal yee be our seruants, and serue vs."
9,17,10,"Also the Philistim saide, I defie the hoste of Israel this day: giue mee a man, that we may fight together."
9,17,11,"When Saul & all Israel heard those wordes of the Philistim, they were discouraged, & greatly afraide."
9,17,12,"Nowe this Dauid was the sonne of an Ephrathite of Beth-lehem Iudah, named Ishai, which had eight sonnes: and this man was taken for an olde man in the daies of Saul."
9,17,13,"And the three eldest sonnes of Ishai went and followed Saul to the battel: and the names of his three sonnes that went to battell, were Eliab the Eldest, and the next Abinadab, and the thirde Shammah."
9,17,14,"So Dauid was the least: and the three eldest went after Saul."
9,17,15,"But David"
9,17,16,"And the Philistim drew neere in the morning, and euening, and continued fourtie daies."
9,17,17,"And Jesse said unto David his son,"
9,17,18,"And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of [their] thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their"
9,17,19,"(Then Saul and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistims)"
9,17,20,"So Dauid rose vp earely in the morning, and left the sheepe with a keeper, and tooke and went as Ishai had commaunded him, and came within the compasse of the hoste: and the hoste went out in araie, and shouted in the battell."
9,17,21,"For Israel & the Philistims had put themselues in araie, armie against armie."
9,17,22,"And Dauid left the things, which hee bare, vnder the handes of the keeper of the cariage, and ranne into the hoste, and came, and asked his brethren howe they did."
9,17,23,"And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the"
9,17,24,"And all the men of Israel, when they sawe the man, ranne away from him, and were sore afraied."
9,17,25,"And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, [that] the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house"
9,17,26,"And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the"
9,17,27,"And the people answered him after this maner, saying, Thus shall it be done to the man that killeth him."
9,17,28,"And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake vnto the men, and Eliab was verie angrie with Dauid, and sayde, Why camest thou downe hither? and with whome hast thou left those fewe sheepe in the wildernesse? I knowe thy pride and the malice of thine heart, that thou art come downe to see the battell."
9,17,29,"And David said, What have I now done? [Is there] not a"
9,17,30,"And hee departed from him into the presence of another, and spake of the same maner, and the people answered him according to the former woordes."
9,17,31,"And they that heard the wordes which Dauid spake, rehearsed them before Saul, which caused him to be brought."
9,17,32,"So Dauid saide to Saul, Let no mans heart faile him, because of him: thy seruant wil goe, and fight with this Philistim."
9,17,33,"And Saul said to David, Thou art not"
9,17,34,"And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a"
9,17,35,"And I went out after him and smote him, and tooke it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by the beard, and smote him, and slue him."
9,17,36,"So thy seruaunt slue both the lyon, and the beare: therefore this vncircumcised Philistim shall be as one of them, seeing hee hath railed on the hoste of the liuing God."
9,17,37,"David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David,"
9,17,38,"And Saul put his rayment vpon Dauid, & put an helmet of brasse vpon his head, and put a brigandine vpon him."
9,17,39,"Then girded Dauid his sword vpon his rayment, and began to go: for he neuer proued it: and Dauid sayde vnto Saul, I can not goe with these: for I am not accustomed. wherefore Dauid put them off him."
9,17,40,"And he took his"
9,17,41,"And the Philistim came and drew neere vnto Dauid, and the man that bare the shielde went before him."
9,17,42,"Now when the Philistim looked about & saw Dauid, he disdeined him: for he was but yong, ruddie, and of a comely face."
9,17,43,"And the Philistine said unto David, [Am] I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine"
9,17,44,"And the Philistim sayd to Dauid, Come to me, & I will giue thy flesh vnto the foules of the heauen, and to the beastes of the field."
9,17,45,"Then sayd Dauid to the Philistim, Thou commest to me with a sword, and with a speare, & with a shield, but I come to thee in the Name of the Lord of hostes, the God of the hoste of Israel, whom thou hast rayled vpon."
9,17,46,"This"
9,17,47,"And that all this assembly may know, that the Lord saueth not with sworde nor with speare (for the battel is the Lords) and he will giue you into our handes."
9,17,48,"And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David"
9,17,49,"And Dauid put his hande in his bagge, and tooke out a stone, and slang it, & smote the Philistim in his forehead, that the stone sticked in his forehead, and he fell groueling to the earth."
9,17,50,"So Dauid ouercame the Philistim with a sling & with a stone, & smote the Philistim, and slew him, when Dauid had no sword in his hand."
9,17,51,"Then Dauid ranne, & stood vpon the Philistim, and tooke his sword and drew it out of his sheath, and slewe him, and cut off his head therewith. So whe the Philistims saw, that their champion was dead, they fled."
9,17,52,"And the men of Israel and Iudah arose, & shouted, and followed after the Philistims, vntill they came to the valley, & vnto the gates of Ekron: and the Philistims fell downe wounded by the way of Shaaraim, euen to Gath & to Ekron."
9,17,53,"And the children of Israel returned from pursuing the Philistims, & spoyled their tents."
9,17,54,"And Dauid tooke the head of ye Philistim, and brought it to Ierusalem, and put his armour in his tent."
9,17,55,"And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner,"
9,17,56,"Then the King sayde, Enquire thou whose sonne this yong man is."
9,17,57,"And when Dauid was returned from the slaughter of the Philistim, then Abner tooke him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistim in his hand."
9,17,58,"And Saul sayde to him, Whose sonne art thou, thou yong man? And Dauid answered, I am the sonne of thy seruant Ishai the Bethlehemite."
9,18,1,"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the"
9,18,2,"And Saul tooke him that day, and woulde not let him returne to his fathers house."
9,18,3,"Then Ionathan and Dauid made a couenant: for he loued him as his owne soule."
9,18,4,"And Ionathan put off the robe that was vpon him, & gaue it Dauid, & his garments, euen to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle."
9,18,5,"And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, [and] behaved himself"
9,18,6,"And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the"
9,18,7,"And the women sang by course in their play, and sayd, Saul hath slayne his thousand, & Dauid his ten thousand."
9,18,8,"Therefore Saul was exceeding wroth, and the saying displeased him, & he sayde, They haue ascribed vnto Dauid ten thousand, & to me they haue ascribed but a thousand, & what can he haue more saue the kingdome?"
9,18,9,"And Saul"
9,18,10,"And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he"
9,18,11,"And Saul tooke the speare, and sayd, I will smite Dauid through to the wall. But Dauid auoyded twise out of his presence."
9,18,12,"And Saul was afrayd of Dauid, because the Lord was with him, & was departed from Saul."
9,18,13,"Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went"
9,18,14,"And Dauid behaued himselfe wisely in all his wayes: for the Lord was with him."
9,18,15,"Wherefore when Saul saw that he was very wise, he was afrayde of him."
9,18,16,"For all Israel and Iudah loued Dauid, because he went out and in before them."
9,18,17,"And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and"
9,18,18,"And Dauid answered Saul, What am I? and what is my life, or the family of my father in Israel, that I should be sonne in law to the King?"
9,18,19,"But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that"
9,18,20,"Then Michal Sauls daughter loued Dauid: & they shewed Saul, & the thing pleased him."
9,18,21,"And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a"
9,18,22,"And Saul commanded his seruants, Speake with Dauid secretly, & say, Behold, ye King hath a fauour to thee, and all his seruants loue thee: be now therefore the Kings sonne in law."
9,18,23,"And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said,"
9,18,24,"And then Sauls seruats brought him word againe, saying, Such wordes spake Dauid."
9,18,25,"And Saul sayd, This wise shal ye say to Dauid, The King desireth no dowrie, but an hundred foreskinnes of the Philistims, to bee auenged of the Kings enemies: for Saul thought to make Dauid fall into the handes of the Philistims."
9,18,26,"And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the"
9,18,27,"Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and"
9,18,28,"Then Saul sawe, and vnderstoode that the Lord was with Dauid, & that Michal the daughter of Saul loued him."
9,18,29,"And Saul was yet the more afraid"
9,18,30,"Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, [that]"
9,19,1,"And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should"
9,19,2,"And Ionathan told Dauid, saying, Saul my father goeth about to slay thee: nowe therefore, I pray thee, take heede vnto thy selfe vnto the morning, & abide in a secret place, & hide thy selfe."
9,19,3,"And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou"
9,19,4,"And Ionathan spake good of Dauid vnto Saul his father, & said vnto him, Let not the King sinne against his seruat, against Dauid: for he hath not sinned against thee, but his works haue bene to thee very good."
9,19,5,"For he did put his life in daunger, and slew the Philistim, and the Lord wrought a great saluation for al Israel: thou sawest it, and thou reioycedst: wherefore then wilt thou sinne against innocent blood, and slay Dauid without a cause?"
9,19,6,"And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul"
9,19,7,"So Ionathan called Dauid, and Ionathan shewed him all those words, & Ionathan brought Dauid to Saul, and hee was in his presence as in times past."
9,19,8,"Againe the warre began, & Dauid went out & fought with the Philistims, and slew them with a great slaughter, and they fled from him."
9,19,9,"And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David"
9,19,10,"And Saul intended to smite Dauid to the wall with the speare: but hee turned aside out of Sauls presence, & he smote the speare against the wall: but Dauid fled, & escaped the same night."
9,19,11,"Saul also sent messengers vnto Dauids house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal Dauids wife told it him, saying, If thou saue not thy selfe this night, to morowe thou shalt be slayne."
9,19,12,"So Michal"
9,19,13,"Then Michal tooke an image, & layde it in the bed, & put a pillow stuffed with goates heare vnder the head of it, & couered it with a cloth."
9,19,14,"And when Saul sent messengers to take Dauid, she sayd, He is sicke."
9,19,15,"And Saul sent the messengers [again] to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the"
9,19,16,"And when the messengers were come in, behold, an image was in the bed, with a pillow of goates heare vnder the head of it."
9,19,17,"And Saul said vnto Michal, Why hast thou mocked me so, & sent away mine enemie, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said vnto me, Let me go, or els I will kill thee."
9,19,18,"So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in"
9,19,19,"But one tolde Saul, saying, Beholde, Dauid is at Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,20,"And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing"
9,19,21,"And when it was tolde Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophecied likewise: againe Saul sent the third messengers, and they prophecied also."
9,19,22,"Then went he himselfe to Ramah, & came to a great well that is in Sechu, and he asked, and sayd, Where are Samuel and Dauid? & one sayd, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah."
9,19,23,"And he"
9,19,24,"And he stripped off his"
9,20,1,"And David"
9,20,2,"And he sayde vnto him, God forbid, thou shalt not die: beholde, my father will do nothing great nor small, but he will shewe it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? He will not doe it."
9,20,3,"And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly [as] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, [there is] but a"

9,20,5,"And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow [is] the"

9,20,7,"And if he say thus, It is well, thy seruant shall haue peace: but if he be angrie, be sure that wickednesse is concluded of him."
9,20,8,"So shalt thou shew mercy vnto thy seruant: for thou hast ioyned thy seruant into a couenant of the Lord with thee, and if there be in me iniquitie, slay thou me: for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?"
9,20,9,"And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were"
9,20,10,"Then said David to Jonathan, Who"
9,20,11,"And Ionathan sayde to Dauid, Come and let vs goe out into the fielde: and they twaine went out into the fielde."
9,20,12,"Then Ionathan sayde to Dauid, O Lorde God of Israel, when I haue groped my fathers minde to morow at this time, or within this three dayes, and if it be well with Dauid, and I then send not vnto thee, and shewe it thee,"
9,20,13,"The LORD"
9,20,14,"And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD,"
9,20,15,"But I require that thou cut not off thy mercie from mine house for euer: no, not when the Lorde hath destroyed the enemies of Dauid, euery one from the earth."
9,20,16,"So Ionathan made a bond with the house of Dauid, saying, Let the Lorde require it at the hands of Dauids enemies."
9,20,17,"And againe Ionathan sware vnto Dauid, because he loued him (for he loued him as his owne soule)"
9,20,18,"Then said Ionathan to him, To morowe is the first day of the moneth: and thou shalt be looked for, for thy place shalbe emptie."
9,20,19,"Therefore thou shalt hide thy selfe three dayes, then thou shalt goe downe quickely and come to the place where thou diddest hide thy selfe, when this matter was in hand, and shalt remayne by the stone Ezel."
9,20,20,"And I will shoote three arrowes on the side thereof, as though I shot at a marke."
9,20,21,"And after I wil sende a boy, saying, Goe, seeke the arrowes. If I say vnto the boy, See, the arrowes are on this side thee, bring them, & come thou: for it is well with thee and no hurt, as the Lord liueth."
9,20,22,"But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows [are] beyond thee; go thy way: for the"
9,20,23,"As touching the thing which thou and I haue spoken of, beholde, the Lorde be betweene thee and me for euer."
9,20,24,"So Dauid hid him selfe in the field: and when the first day of the moneth came, the King sate to eate meate."
9,20,25,"And the King sate, as at other times vpon his seate, euen vpon his seate by the wall: and Ionathan arose, and Abner sate by Sauls side, but Dauids place was emptie."
9,20,26,"Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he [is] not"
9,20,27,"And it came to pass on the morrow, [which was] the second [day] of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not"
9,20,28,"And Ionathan answered vnto Saul, Dauid required of me, that he might goe to Beth-lehem."
9,20,29,"And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me [to be there]: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my"
9,20,30,"Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou"
9,20,31,"For as long as the sonne of Ishai liueth vpon the earth, thou shalt not be stablished, nor thy kingdome: wherefore now send and fet him vnto me, for he shall surely die."
9,20,32,"And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be"
9,20,33,"And Saul cast a speare at him to hit him, whereby Ionathan knew, that it was determined of his father to slay Dauid."
9,20,34,"So Ionathan arose from the table in a great anger, and did eate no meate the seconde day of the moneth: for he was sorie for Dauid, and because his father had reuiled him."
9,20,35,"And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field"
9,20,36,"And he saide vnto his boy, Runne now, seeke the arrowes which I shoote, and as the boy ran, he shot an arrowe beyond him."
9,20,37,"And when the boy was come to the place where the arrowe was that Ionathan had shot, Ionathan cryed after the boy, and sayde, Is not the arrowe beyond thee?"
9,20,38,"And Jonathan cried after the lad,"
9,20,39,"But the boy knewe nothing: onely Ionathan and Dauid knew the matter."
9,20,40,"Then Ionathan gaue his bowe and arrowes vnto the boy that was with him, and sayd vnto him, Goe, carrie them into the citie."
9,20,41,"[And] as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of [a place] toward the"
9,20,42,"And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have"

9,21,3,"Nowe therefore if thou hast ought vnder thine hande, giue me fiue cakes of bread, or what commeth to hand."
9,21,4,"And the priest answered David, and said, [There is] no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from"
9,21,5,"And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women [have been] kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the"
9,21,6,"So the Priest gaue him halowed bread: for there was no bread there, saue the shewe bread that was taken from before the Lord, to put hote bread there, the day that it was taken away."
9,21,7,"Now a certain man of the servants of Saul [was] there that day,"
9,21,8,"And Dauid said vnto Ahimelech, Is there not here vnder thine hand a speare or a sworde? for I haue neither brought my sworde nor mine harnesse with me, because the Kings businesse required haste."
9,21,9,"And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it [is here] wrapped in a cloth behind the"
9,21,10,"And David arose, and"
9,21,11,"And the seruants of Achish said vnto him, Is not this Dauid the King of the land? did they not sing vnto him in daunces, saying, Saul hath slayne his thousand, and Dauid his ten thousande?"
9,21,12,"And Dauid considered these wordes, and wsa sore afraide of Achish the King of Gath."
9,21,13,"And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and"
9,21,14,"Then said Achish vnto his seruants, Lo, ye see the man is beside him selfe, wherefore haue ye brought him to me?"
9,21,15,"Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this [fellow] to play the mad man in my presence?"
9,22,1,"David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave"
9,22,2,"And there gathered vnto him all men that were in trouble and all men that were in dette, and all those that were vexed in minde, and he was their prince, and there were with him about foure hundreth men."
9,22,3,"And David went thence to Mizpeh of"

9,22,6,"When Saul heard that David was"

9,22,9,"Then answered Doeg the Edomite (who was appoynted ouer the seruants of Saul) & sayd, I saw the sonne of Ishai when he came to Nob, to Ahimelech the sonne of Ahitub,"
9,22,10,"Who asked counsell of the Lorde for him and gaue him vitailes, and he gaue him also the sword of Goliath the Philistim."
9,22,11,"Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house,"
9,22,12,"And Saul said, Heare now thou sonne of Ahitub; he answered, Here I am, my lord."
9,22,13,"Then Saul sayde vnto him, Why haue yee conspired against me, thou & the sonne of Ishai, in that thou hast giuen him vitaile, and a sworde, and hast asked counsell of God for him, that he should rise against me, and lye in wayte as appeareth this day?"
9,22,14,"And Ahimelech answered the King, and sayde, Who is so faithfull among all thy seruants as Dauid, being also the Kings sonne in lawe, and goeth at thy commandement, and is honourable in thine house?"
9,22,15,""
9,22,16,"Then the King sayd, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy fathers house."
9,22,17,"And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also [is] with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king"
9,22,18,"Then the King sayde to Doeg, Turne thou and fall vpon the Priests; Doeg the Edomite turned, and ran vpon the Priestes, and slewe that same daye foure score and fiue persons that did weare a linen Ephod."
9,22,19,"Also Nob the citie of the Priestes smote he with the edge of the sword, both man & woman, both childe and suckling, both oxe and asse, and sheepe with the edge of the sword."
9,22,20,"And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar,"
9,22,21,"And Abiathar shewed Dauid, that Saul had slayne the Lords Priestes."
9,22,22,"And Dauid sayd vnto Abiathar, I knewe it the same day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would tell Saul. I am the cause of the death of all the persons of thy fathers house."
9,22,23,"Abide thou with me, & feare not: for he that seeketh my life, shall seeke thy life also: for with me thou shalt be in safegard."
9,23,1,"Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against"
9,23,2,"Therfore Dauid asked counsel of the Lord, saying, Shal I goe and smite these Philistims? And the Lord answered Dauid, Go and smite the Philistims, and saue Keilah."
9,23,3,"And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in"
9,23,4,"Then Dauid asked counsell of the Lord againe; the Lord answered him, & sayd, Arise, go downe to Keilah: for I wil deliuer the Philistims into thine hand."
9,23,5,"So Dauid and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistims, & brought away their cattel, & smote them with a great slaughter: thus Dauid saued the inhabitants of Keilah."
9,23,6,"And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, [that] he came down [with] an"
9,23,7,"And it was tolde Saul that Dauid was come to Keilah, & Saul sayd, God hath deliuered him into mine hand: for he is shut in, seeing he is come into a citie that hath gates and barres."
9,23,8,"Then Saul called all the people together to warre, for to go downe to Keilah, & to besiege Dauid and his men."
9,23,9,"And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest,"
9,23,10,"Then sayde Dauid, O Lord God of Israel, thy seruat hath heard, that Saul is about to come to Keilah to destroy the citie for my sake."
9,23,11,"Wil the lordes of Keilah deliuer me vp into his hand? and will Saul come downe, as thy seruant hath heard? O Lord God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy seruant; the Lord sayde, He will come downe."
9,23,12,"Then said Dauid, Will the lords of Keilah deliuer me vp, and the men that are with me, into the hand of Saul? And the Lord sayde, They will deliuer thee vp."
9,23,13,"Then Dauid and his men, which were about sixe hundreth, arose, & departed out of Keilah, and went whither they coulde; it was tolde Saul, that Dauid was fled from Keilah, and he left off his iourney."
9,23,14,"And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God"
9,23,15,"And Dauid sawe that Saul was come out for to seeke his life: and Dauid was in the wildernes of Ziph in the wood."
9,23,16,"And Ionathan Sauls sonne arose and went to Dauid into the wood, and comforted him in God,"
9,23,17,"And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be"
9,23,18,"So they twaine made a couenant before ye Lorde: and Dauid did remaine in the wood: but Ionathan went to his house."
9,23,19,"Then came vp the Ziphims to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doeth not Dauid hide himselfe by vs in holdes, in the wood in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the right side of Ieshimon?"
9,23,20,"Nowe therefore, O King, come downe according to all that thine heart can desire, and our part shall be to deliuer him into the Kinges handes."
9,23,21,"And Saul said,"
9,23,22,"Goe, I pray you, & prepare ye yet better: know and see his place where he haunteth, and who hath seene him there: for it is sayd to me, He is subtile, and craftie."

9,23,27,"But there came a"

9,24,3,"{\cf2 (24:4)} And hee came to the sheepecoates by the way where there was a caue, & Saul went in to do his easement: and Dauid and his men sate in the inward parts of the caue."
9,24,4,"And the men of David said unto him,"
9,24,5,"And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart"

9,24,7,"{\cf2 (24:8)} So Dauid ouercame his seruants with these words, & suffered them not to arise against Saul: so Saul rose vp out of the caue and went away."
9,24,8,"{\cf2 (24:9)} Dauid also arose afterward, and went out of the caue, and cryed after Saul, saying, O my lorde the King; when Saul looked behinde him, Dauid inclined his face to the earth, and bowed himselfe."
9,24,9,"And David said to Saul,"
9,24,10,"{\cf2 (24:11)} Behold, this day thine eyes haue seene, that the Lorde had deliuered thee this day into mine hand in the caue, and some bade me kill thee, but I had compassion on thee, and said, I will not lay mine hande on my master: for he is the Lordes Anoynted."
9,24,11,"{\cf2 (24:12)} Moreouer my father, behold: behold, I say, the lappe of thy garment in mine hand: for when I cut off the lappe of thy garment, I killed thee not. Vnderstad & see, that there is neither euil nor wickednesse in mee, neither haue I sinned against thee, yet thou huntest after my soule to take it."
9,24,12,"{\cf2 (24:13)} The Lord be iudge betweene thee and me, and the Lord auenge me of thee, & let not mine hand be vpon thee."
9,24,13,"{\cf2 (24:14)} According as the olde prouerbe sayeth, Wickednesse proceedeth from the wicked, but mine hand be not vpon thee."
9,24,14,"{\cf2 (24:15)} After whom is the King of Israel come out? after whome doest thou pursue? after a dead dog, and after a flea?"
9,24,15,"{\cf2 (24:16)} The Lord therfore be iudge, and iudge betweene thee and me, and see, & pleade my cause, and deliuer me out of thine hand."
9,24,16,"And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said,"
9,24,17,"{\cf2 (24:18)} And sayd to Dauid, Thou art more righteous then I: for thou hast rendred me good, and I haue rendred thee euill."
9,24,18,"{\cf2 (24:19)} And thou hast shewed this day, that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the Lord had closed me in thine hands, thou killedst me not."
9,24,19,"{\cf2 (24:20)} For who shal finde his enemie, and let him depart free? wherefore the Lorde render thee good for that thou hast done vnto me this day."
9,24,20,"And now, behold, I"

9,24,22,"{\cf2 (24:23)} So Dauid sware vnto Saul, and Saul went home: but Dauid & his men went vp vnto ye hold."

9,25,4,"And Dauid heard in the wildernesse, that Nabal did shere his sheepe."
9,25,5,"Therefore Dauid sent tenne yong men, & Dauid said vnto the yong men, Go vp to Carmel, and go to Nabal, & aske him in my name how he doeth."
9,25,6,"And thus shall ye say"
9,25,7,"Behold, I haue heard, that thou hast sherers: now thy shepherds were with vs, and we did the no hurt, neyther did they misse any thing all the while they were in Carmel."

9,25,12,"So Dauids seruants turned their way, and went againe, and came, and tolde him all those things."
9,25,13,"And Dauid said vnto his men, Girde euery man his sword about him. And they girded euery man his sworde: Dauid also girded his sworde; about foure hundreth men went vp after Dauid, and two hundreth abode by the cariage."
9,25,14,"Nowe one of the seruantes tolde Abigail Nabals wife, saying, Beholde, Dauid sent messengers out of the wildernesse to salute our master, and he rayled on them."
9,25,15,"But the men [were] very good"
9,25,16,"They were as a wall vnto vs both by night & by day, all the while we were with them keeping sheepe."
9,25,17,"Nowe therefore take heede, and see what thou shalt doe: for euill will surely come vpon our master, and vpon all his familie: for he is so wicked that a man can not speake to him."
9,25,18,"Then Abigail made haste, & tooke two hundreth cakes, & two bottels of wine, & fiue sheepe ready dressed, & fiue measures of parched corne, and an hundreth frailes of raisins, & two hundreth of figs, and laded them on asses."
9,25,19,"And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her"
9,25,20,"And as shee rode on her asse, shee came downe by a secret place of the mountaine, and beholde, Dauid and his men came downe against her, and she met them."
9,25,21,"And Dauid said, In deede I haue kept all in vaine that this fellow had in the wildernesse, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained vnto him: for he hath requited me euill for good."
9,25,22,"So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that [pertain] to him by the morning light any that"
9,25,23,"And when Abigail sawe Dauid, she hasted and lighted off her asse, and fell before Dauid on her face, and bowed her selfe to the ground,"
9,25,24,"And fel at his feete, and sayd, Oh, my lord, I haue committed the iniquitie, and I pray thee, let thine handmayde speake to thee, and heare thou the wordes of thine handmayde."
9,25,25,"Let not my lorde, I pray thee, regard this wicked man Nabal: for as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and follie is with him: but I thine handmayde sawe not the yong men of my lord whom thou sentest."
9,25,26,"Now therefore, my lord, [as] the LORD liveth, and [as] thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to [shed] blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own"

10,3,21,"Then Abner sayde vnto Dauid, I will rise vp, and goe gather all Israel vnto my lorde the King, that they may make a couenant with thee, and that thou mayest reigne ouer all that thine heart desireth. Then Dauid let Abner depart, who went in peace."
10,3,22,"And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came"
10,3,23,"When Ioab, & all the hoste that was with him were come, men tolde Ioab, saying, Abner the sonne of Ner came to the King, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace."
10,3,24,"Then Joab came to the king, and said,"
10,3,25,"Thou knowest Abner the sonne of Ner: for he came to deceiue thee, and to knowe thy outgoing and ingoing, and to knowe all that thou doest."
10,3,26,"And when Ioab was gone out from Dauid, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him againe from the well of Siriah vnknowing to Dauid."
10,3,27,"And when Abner was come againe to Hebron, Ioab tooke him aside in the gate to speake with him peaceably, and smote him vnder the fift ryb, that he dyed, for the blood of Asahel his brother."
10,3,28,"And afterward when David heard [it], he said, I and my kingdom [are]"
10,3,29,"Let the blood fall on the head of Ioab, and on all his fathers house, that the house of Ioab be neuer without some that haue running issues, or leper, or that leaneth on a staffe, or that doeth fall on the sworde, or that lacketh bread."
10,3,30,"So Joab and"
10,3,31,"And David said to Joab, and to all the people that [were] with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn"
10,3,32,"And when they had buryed Abner in Hebron, the King lift vp his voyce, and wept beside the sepulchre of Abner, and all the people wept."
10,3,33,"And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner"
10,3,34,"Thine handes were not bounde, nor thy feete tyed in fetters of brasse: but as a man falleth before wicked men, so diddest thou fall; all the people wept againe for him."
10,3,35,"And when all the people came to cause David to eat"
10,3,36,"And all the people took notice [of it], and it"
10,3,37,"For all the people and all Israel vnderstoode that day, howe that it was not the Kings deede that Abner the sonne of Ner was slaine."
10,3,38,"And the King said vnto his seruants, Know ye not, that there is a prince & a great man falle this day in Israel?"
10,3,39,"And I am this day weake and newly anoynted King: and these men the sonnes of Zeruiah be too harde for me: the Lorde rewarde the doer of euill according to his wickednesse."
10,4,1,"And when Saul's"

10,4,5,"And the sonnes of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah went and came in the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth (who slept on a bed at noone)"
10,4,6,"And they came thither into the midst of the house, [as though] they"
10,4,7,"For when they came into the house, he slept on his bed in his bed chamber, & they smote him, and slewe him, and beheaded him, and tooke his head, and gate them away through the plaine all the night."
10,4,8,"And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth vnto Dauid to Hebron, and saide to the King, Beholde the head of Ish-bosheth Sauls sonne thine enemie, who sought after thy life: and the Lorde hath auenged my lorde the King this day of Saul, and of his seede."
10,4,9,"Then Dauid answered Rechab & Baanah his brother, the sonnes of Rimmon the Beerothite, and saide vnto them, As the Lorde liueth, who hath deliuered my soule out of al aduersity,"
10,4,10,"When one tolde me, and sayde that Saul was dead, (thinking to haue brought good tydings) I tooke him and slewe him in Ziklag, who thought that I woulde haue giuen him a rewarde for his tidings:"
10,4,11,"How"
10,4,12,"Then Dauid commanded his yong men, & they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feete, and hanged them vp ouer the poole in Hebron: but they tooke the head of Ish-bosheth, & buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron."
10,5,1,"Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we [are] thy"
10,5,2,"And in time past when Saul was our King, thou leddest Israel in and out: and the Lord hath sayde to thee, Thou shalt feede my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captaine ouer Israel."
10,5,3,"So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron"
10,5,4,"Dauid was thirtie yeere olde when he began to reigne: and hee reigned fortie yeere."
10,5,5,"In Hebron hee reigned ouer Iudah seuen yeere, and sixe moneths: and in Ierusalem hee reigned thirtie and three yeeres ouer all Israel and Iudah."
10,5,6,"And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the"

10,5,11,"Hiram also king of Tyrus sent messengers to Dauid, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons for walles: and they built Dauid an house."
10,5,12,"Then Dauid knewe that the Lorde had stablished him King ouer Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdome for his people Israels sake."
10,5,13,"And Dauid tooke him mo concubines & wiues out of Ierusalem, after hee was come from Hebron, & mo sonnes and daughters were borne to Dauid."
10,5,14,"And these bee the names of the sonnes that were borne vnto him in Ierusale: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Salomon,"
10,5,15,"And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Iaphia,"
10,5,16,"And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet."
10,5,17,"But when the Philistims hearde that they had anoynted Dauid King ouer Israel, all the Philistims came vp to seeke Dauid: and when Dauid heard, he went downe to a fort."
10,5,18,"But the Philistims came, and spred themselues in the valley of Rephaim."
10,5,19,"And David"
10,5,20,"Then Dauid came to Baal-perazim, & smote them there, and sayde, The Lorde hath deuided mine enemies asunder before mee, as waters be deuided asunder: therefore he called the name of that place, Baal-perazim."
10,5,21,"And there they left their images, and Dauid and his men burnt them."
10,5,22,"And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of"

10,6,5,"And David and all the house of Israel"
10,6,6,"And when they came to Nachons threshing floore, Vzzah put his hande to the Arke of God, and helde it: for the oxen did shake it."
10,6,7,"And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God"
10,6,8,"And Dauid was displeased, because the Lord had smitten Vzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez Vzzah vntill this day."
10,6,9,"Therefore Dauid that day feared the Lord, and sayd, How shall the Arke of the Lorde come to mee?"
10,6,10,"So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom"
10,6,11,"And the Arke of the Lorde continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite, three moneths, and the Lorde blessed Obed-edom, and all his houshold."
10,6,12,"And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that [pertaineth] unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and"
10,6,13,"And when they that bare the Arke of the Lord had gone sixe paces, he offred an oxe, and a fatte beast."
10,6,14,"And David danced before the LORD with all [his] might; and David [was] girded with a linen"
10,6,15,"So Dauid & all the house of Israel, brought the Arke of the Lord with shouting, and sound of trumpet."
10,6,16,"And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she"
10,6,17,"And when they had brought in the Arke of the Lord, they set it in his place, in the mids of the tabernacle that Dauid had pitched for it: then Dauid offred burnt offrings, and peace offrings before the Lord."
10,6,18,"And assoone as Dauid had made an ende of offring burnt offrings and peace offrings, hee blessed the people in the Name of the Lorde of hostes,"
10,6,19,"And gaue among all the people, euen among the whole multitude of Israel, aswel to the women as men, to euerie one a cake of bread, and a piece of flesh, and a bottell of wine: so all the people departed euerie one to his house."
10,6,20,"Then David returned to"

10,7,22,"Wherefore thou art great, O Lorde God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that wee haue heard with our eares."

10,12,17,"And the elders of his house arose, [and went] to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat"
10,12,18,"So on the seuenth day the child dyed: and the seruants of Dauid feared to tell him that the childe was dead: for they sayde, Beholde, while the childe was aliue, we spake vnto him, and he woulde not hearken vnto our voyce: how then shall we say vnto him, The childe is dead, to vexe him more?"
10,12,19,"But when Dauid sawe that his seruantes whispered, Dauid perceiued that the childe was dead: therefore Dauid sayde vnto his seruants, Is the childe dead? And they sayd, He is dead."
10,12,20,"Then David"
10,12,21,"Then"
10,12,22,"And he sayde, While the childe was yet aliue, I fasted, and wept: for I sayde, Who can tell whether God will haue mercy on me, that the childe may liue?"

10,12,28,"Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, & besiege the city, that thou mayest take it, lest the victorie be attributed to me."
10,12,29,"So Dauid gathered al the people together, and went against Rabbah, and besieged it, and tooke it."

10,13,5,"And Jonadab said unto him,"
10,13,6,"So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of"

10,13,8,"So Tamar went to her brother Amnons house, and he lay downe: and she tooke floure, and knead it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes."
10,13,9,"And she took a pan, and"
10,13,10,"Then Amnon said vnto Tamar, Bring the meate into the chamber, that I may eate of thine hand; Tamar tooke the cakes which shee had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother."
10,13,11,"And when she had set them before him to eate, he tooke her, and sayd vnto her, Come, lye with me, my sister."
10,13,12,"But shee answered him, Nay, my brother, doe not force me: for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: commit not this follie."

10,13,15,"Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred wherewith he hated her, was greater then the loue, wherewith hee had loued her: and Amnon sayde vnto her, Vp, get thee hence."
10,13,16,"And she answered him, There is no cause: this euill (to put mee away) is greater then the other that thou diddest vnto me: but he would not heare her,"
10,13,17,"But called his seruant that serued him, & sayd, Put this woman now out from me, & locke the doore after her."

10,13,20,"And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but"
10,13,21,"But when King Dauid heard all these things, he was very wroth."
10,13,22,"And Absalom sayde vnto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar."
10,13,23,"And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which [is] beside Ephraim: and"
10,13,24,"And Absalom came to the King and sayd, Beholde now, thy seruant hath sheepesherers: I pray thee, that the King with his seruants would goe with thy seruant."
10,13,25,"But the King answered Absalom, Nay my sonne, I pray thee, let vs not goe all, lest we be chargeable vnto thee. Yet Absalom lay sore vpon him: howbeit he would not go, but thaked him."
10,13,26,"Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother"

10,13,29,"And the seruantes of Absalom did vnto Amnon, as Absalom had commanded: and al the Kings sonnes arose, and euery man gate him vp vpon his mule, and fled."
10,13,30,"And while they were in the way, tydings came to Dauid, saying, Absalom hath slaine al the Kings sonnes, & there is not one of them left."
10,13,31,"Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the"
10,13,32,"And Ionadab the sonne of Shimeah Dauids brother answered and sayde, Let not my lord suppose that they haue slayne all the yong men the Kings sonnes: for Amnon onely is dead, because Absalom had reported so, since hee forced his sister Tamar."
10,13,33,"Nowe therefore let not my lord the King take the thing so grieuously, to thinke that all ye Kings sonnes are dead: for Amnon only is dead."
10,13,34,"Then Absalom fled: and the yong man that kept the watch, lift vp his eyes, and looked, and behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behinde him."
10,13,35,"And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said,"
10,13,36,"And assoone as hee had left speaking, behold, the Kings sonnes came, & lift vp their voyces, and wept: and the King also and all his seruants wept exceedingly sore."
10,13,37,"But Absalom fled, and went to"
10,13,38,"So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three yeeres."

10,14,1,"Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's"

10,14,4,"Then the woman of Tekoah spake vnto the king, & fel downe on her face to the ground, and did obeysance, and sayd, Helpe, O King."
10,14,5,"Then the King sayd vnto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am in deede a widow, and mine husband is dead:"

10,14,13,"And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou"
10,14,14,"For we must needs die, and [are] as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect [any] person: yet doth he devise"

10,14,17,"Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an"
10,14,18,"Then the King answered, and said vnto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall aske thee; the woman sayde, Let my lord the King now speake."
10,14,19,"And the king said, [Is not]"
10,14,20,"To fetch about this"
10,14,21,"And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have"
10,14,22,"And Ioab fell to the grounde on his face, and bowed himselfe, & thanked the King. Then Ioab sayde, This day thy seruant knoweth, that I haue found grace in thy sight, my lord the King, in that the King hath fulfilled the request of his seruant."
10,14,23,"And Ioab arose, and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Ierusalem."
10,14,24,"And the king said, Let him"
10,14,25,"Nowe in all Israel there was none to be so much praysed for beautie as Absalom: from the sole of his foote euen to the toppe of his head there was no blemish in him."
10,14,26,"And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled [it]: because [the hair] was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred"
10,14,27,"And Absalom had three sonnes, and one daughter named Tamar, which was a fayre woman to looke vpon."
10,14,28,"So Absalom dwelt the space of two yeres in Ierusalem, and saw not the Kings face."
10,14,29,"Therefore Absalom sent for Ioab to sende him to the King, but he would not come to him: and when he sent againe, he would not come."
10,14,30,"Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it"
10,14,31,"Then Ioab arose, & came to Absalom vnto his house, & sayd vnto him, Wherefore haue thy seruants burnt my field with fire?"
10,14,32,"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? [it had been] good for me [to have been] there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and"
10,14,33,"Then Ioab came to the King, & told him: & he called for Absalom, who came to the King, and bowed himselfe to the grounde on his face before the King, and the King kissed Absalom."
10,15,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to"
10,15,2,"And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was [so], that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city [art] thou? And he said, Thy servant [is] of one of the"
10,15,3,"Then Absalom said vnto him, See, thy matters are good and righteous, but there is no man deputed of the King to heare thee."
10,15,4,"Absalom said moreover,"
10,15,5,"And when any man came neere to him, and did him obeisance, he put forth his hand, & tooke him, and kissed him."
10,15,6,"And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom"
10,15,7,"And it came to pass after"
10,15,8,"For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will"
10,15,9,"And the King sayd vnto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron."
10,15,10,"Then Absalom sent spyes throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, When yee heare the sound of the trumpet, Ye shal say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron."
10,15,11,"And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, [that were]"
10,15,12,"Also Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite Dauids counseller, from his citie Giloh, while he offred sacrifices: & the treason was great: for the people encreased still with Absalom."
10,15,13,"Then came a messenger to Dauid, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are turned after Absalom."
10,15,14,"And David said unto all his servants that [were] with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not [else] escape from"
10,15,15,"And the Kings seruants sayd vnto him, Behold, thy seruants are ready to do according to all that my lord the King shal appoynt."
10,15,16,"So the King departed and all his houshold after him, and the King left ten concubines to keepe the house."

10,15,21,"And Ittai answered the King, and sayde, As the Lorde liueth, and as my lord the King liueth, in what place my lord the King shalbe, whether in death or life, euen there surely will thy seruant bee."
10,15,22,"Then Dauid sayd to Ittai, Come, & go forward; Ittai the Gittite went, and all his men, and all the children that were with him."
10,15,23,"And all the country wept with a loud voice, and"
10,15,24,"And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites [were] with him,"
10,15,25,"Then the King said vnto Zadok, Carie the Arke of God againe into the citie: if I shall finde fauour in the eyes of the Lorde, he will bring me againe, and shewe me both it, and the Tabernacle thereof."
10,15,26,"But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold,"
10,15,27,"The King sayde againe vnto Zadok the Priest, Art not thou a Seer? returne into the citie in peace, and your two sonnes with you: to wit, Ahimaaz thy sonne, and Ionathan the sonne of Abiathar."
10,15,28,"Behold, I wil tarie in the fieldes of the wildernesse, vntill there come some worde from you to be tolde me."
10,15,29,"Zadok therefore and Abiathar caried the Arke of God againe to Ierusalem, and they taried there."
10,15,30,"And David went up by the ascent of [mount] Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head"

10,15,32,"Then Dauid came to the toppe of the mount where he worshipped God: and beholde, Hushai the Archite came against him with his coate torne, and hauing earth vpon his head."
10,15,33,"Vnto whom Dauid sayd, If thou goe with me, thou shalt be a burthen vnto me."
10,15,34,"But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy"
10,15,35,"And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the Priests? therefore what so euer thou shalt heare out of the Kings house, thou shalt shew to Zadok and Abiathar the Priests."
10,15,36,"Beholde, there are with them their two sonnes: Ahimaaz Zadoks sonne, and Ionathan Abiathars sonne: by them also shall ye send me euery thing that ye can heare."
10,15,37,"So Hushai Dauids friend went into the citie: and Absalom came into Ierusalem."

10,16,4,"Then said the King to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that perteined vnto Mephibosheth; Ziba saide, I beseech thee, let me finde grace in thy sight, my lord, O King."
10,16,5,"And when king David came to"

10,16,8,"The LORD hath returned upon thee all the"
10,16,9,"Then saide Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah vnto the King, Why doeth this dead dog curse my lord the King? let me goe, I pray thee, and take away his head."
10,16,10,"And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath"
10,16,11,"And Dauid sayd to Abishai, and to all his seruants, Beholde, my sonne which came out of mine owne bowels, seeketh my life: then howe much more now may this sonne of Iemini? Suffer him to curse: for the Lord hath bidden him."
10,16,12,"It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will"
10,16,13,"And as Dauid and his men went by the way, Shimei went by the side of the mountaine ouer against him, and cursed as he went, & threw stones against him, and cast dust."
10,16,14,"And the king, and all the people that [were] with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves"
10,16,15,"And Absalom, & all the people, the men of Israel, came to Ierusalem, and Ahithophel with him."
10,16,16,"And when Hushai the Archite Dauids friend was come vnto Absalom, Hushai said vnto Absalom, God saue the King, God saue the King."
10,16,17,"And Absalom said to Hushai, [Is] this thy kindness to thy"
10,16,18,"Hushai then answered vnto Absalom, Nay, but whome the Lord, and this people, and all the men of Israel chuse, his will I be, and with him will I dwell."
10,16,19,"And moreouer vnto whome shall I doe seruice? not to his sonne? as I serued before thy father, so will I before thee."
10,16,20,"Then spake Absalom to Ahithophel, Giue counsell what we shall doe."
10,16,21,"And"
10,16,22,"So they spread Absalom a tent vpon the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his fathers concubines in the sight of all Israel."
10,16,23,"And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, [was] as if a man had"
10,17,1,"Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom,"
10,17,2,"And I will come vpon him: for he is wearie, and weake handed: so I will feare him, and all the people that are with him, shall flee, and I will smite the King onely,"
10,17,3,"And I will bring back all the people unto thee:"
10,17,4,"And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the Elders of Israel."
10,17,5,"Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let vs heare likewise what he sayth."
10,17,6,"So when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spake vnto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken thus: shall we doe after his saying, or no? tell thou."
10,17,7,"And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given [is] not"
10,17,8,"For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father, and his men, that they be strong men, and are chafed in minde as a beare robbed of her whelps in the fielde: also thy father is a valiant warrier, and will not lodge with the people."
10,17,9,"Behold, he is hid now in some caue, or in some place: and though some of them be ouerthrowen at the first, yet the people shall heare, and say, The people that follow Absalom, be ouerthrowen."
10,17,10,"Then he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall shrinke and faint: for all Israel knoweth, that thy father is valiant, and they which be with him, stout men."
10,17,11,"Therefore my counsell is, that all Israel be gathered vnto thee, from Dan euen to Beer-sheba as the sand of the sea in nomber, and that thou goe to battell in thine owne person."
10,17,12,"So shall we come vpon him in some place, where we shall finde him, and we will vpon him as the dewe falleth on the ground: and of all the men that are with him, wee will not leaue him one."
10,17,13,"Moreouer if he be gotten into a citie, then shall all the men of Israel bring ropes to that citie, and we will draw it into the riuer, vntill there be not one small stone founde there."
10,17,14,"And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite [is] better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the"
10,17,15,"Then said Hushai vnto Zadok and to Abiathar the Priests, Of this and that maner did Ahithophel and the Elders of Israel counsell Absalom: and thus and thus haue I counseled."

10,17,29,"And they brought honie, and butter, and sheepe, and cheese of kine for Dauid and for the people that were with him, to eate: for they said, The people is hungry, and wearie, and thirstie in the wildernesse."
10,18,1,"And David"
10,18,2,"And Dauid sent foorth the third part of the people vnder the hand of Ioab, and the thirde part vnder the hand of Abishai Ioabs brother the sonne of Zeruiah: and the other third part vnder the hand of Ittai the Gittite; the King said vnto the people, I will go with you my selfe also."
10,18,3,"But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but"
10,18,4,"Then the King said vnto them, What seemeth you best, that I will doe. So the King stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreths and by thousands."

11,1,46,"And Salomon also sitteth on the throne of the kingdome."

11,2,12,"Then sate Salomon vpon the throne of Dauid his father, and his kingdome was stablished mightily."

11,2,21,"She sayd then, Let Abishag the Shunammite be giuen to Adonijah thy brother to wife."

11,2,24,"Now therefore as ye Lord liueth, who hath established me, & set me on the throne of Dauid my father, who also hath made me an house, as he promised, Adoniiah shall surely die this day."
11,2,25,"And King Salomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and hee smote him that he dyed."

11,2,31,"And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and"
11,2,32,"And the Lorde shall bring his blood vpon his owne head: for he smote two men more righteous and better then he, and slew them with the sword, & my father Dauid knew not: to wit, Abner the sonne of Ner, captaine of the hoste of Israel, and Amasa the sonne of Iether captaine of the hoste of Iudah."
11,2,33,"Their blood shall therefore return upon the"
11,2,34,"So Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada went vp, & smote him, and slewe him, & he was buryed in his owne house in the wildernesse."

11,2,37,"For that day that thou goest out, and passest ouer the riuer of Kidron, knowe assuredly, that thou shalt dye the death: thy blood shall be vpon thine owne head."
11,2,38,"And Shimei sayd vnto the King, The thing is good: as my lord the King hath sayd, so wil thy seruant doe. So Shimei dwelt in Ierusalem many dayes."

11,5,5,"And beholde, I purpose to build an house vnto ye Name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake vnto Dauid my father, saying, Thy sonne, whom I wil set vpon thy throne for thee, he shal build an house vnto my Name."
11,5,6,"Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give"
11,5,7,"And it came to pass, when"
11,5,8,"And Hiram sent to Salomon, saying, I haue considered the things, for the which thou sentest vnto me, and will accomplish all thy desire, concerning the cedar trees and firre trees."
11,5,9,"My servants shall bring [them] down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive [them]: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for"

11,5,11,"And Salomon gaue Hiram twentie thousand measures of wheate for foode to his householde, & twentie measures of beaten oyle. Thus much gaue Salomon to Hiram yere by yere."
11,5,12,"And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they"
11,5,13,"And King Salomon raised a summe out of all Israel, and the summe was thirtie thousand men:"
11,5,14,"Whome he sent to Lebanon, ten thousand a moneth by course: they were a moneth in Lebanon, and two moneths at home; Adoniram was ouer the summe."
11,5,15,"And Salomon had seuentie thousand that bare burdens, and fourescore thousand masons in the mountaine,"
11,5,16,"Besides the princes, whome Salomon appoynted ouer the worke, euen three thousande and three hundreth, which ruled the people that wrought in the worke."
11,5,17,"And the King commanded them, and they brought great stones and costly stones to make the foundation of the house, euen hewed stones."
11,5,18,"And Solomon's builders and Hiram's"
11,6,1,"And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month"
11,6,2,"And the house which King Salomon built for the Lorde, was three score cubites long, and twentie broade, and thirtie cubites hie."
11,6,3,"And the"
11,6,4,"And in the house he made windowes, broad without, and narrowe within."
11,6,5,"And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, [against] the walls of the house round about, [both] of the temple and of"
11,6,6,"The nethermost chamber [was] five cubits broad, and the middle [was] six cubits broad, and the third [was] seven cubits broad: for without [in the wall] of the house he made narrowed"
11,6,7,"And when the house was built, it was built of stone perfite, before it was brought, so that there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any toole of yron heard in the house, while it was in building."
11,6,8,"The doore of the middle chamber was in the right side of the house, & men went vp with winding stayres into the middlemost, and out of the middlemost into the third."
11,6,9,"So he built the"
11,6,10,"And he built the galleries vpon al the wall of the house of fiue cubites height, and they were ioyned to the house with beames of cedar."
11,6,11,"And the worde of the Lord came to Salomon, saying,"
11,6,12,"Cocerning this house which thou buildest, if thou wilt walke in mine ordinances, & execute my iudgements, & keepe al my commadements, to walke in them, then will I performe vnto thee my promes, which I promised to Dauid thy father."
11,6,13,"And I will"
11,6,14,"So Salomon built the house & finished it,"
11,6,15,"And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and"
11,6,16,"And he built twentie cubites in the sides of the house with boards of cedar, from the floore to the walles, and he prepared a place within it for the oracle, euen the most holy place."
11,6,17,"And the"
11,6,18,"And the cedar of the house within was carued with knops, and grauen with floures: all was cedar, so that no stone was seene."
11,6,19,"And the oracle he prepared in the"

11,6,21,"So Salomon couered the house within with pure golde: and he shut the place of the oracle with chaines of gold, and couered it with golde."
11,6,22,"And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the"
11,6,23,"And within the oracle he made two Cherubims of oliue tree, ten cubites hie."
11,6,24,"The wing also of the one Cherub was fiue cubites, and the wing of the other Cherub was fiue cubites: from the vttermost part of one of his wings vnto the vttermost part of the other of his wings, were ten cubites."
11,6,25,"Also the other Cherub was of ten cubites: both the Cherubims were of one measure and one sise."
11,6,26,"For the height of the one Cherub was ten cubits, and so was the other Cherub."
11,6,27,"And he put the Cherubims within the inner house, and the Cherubims stretched out their wings, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other Cherub touched the other wall: and their other wings touched one another in the middes of the house."
11,6,28,"And he"
11,6,29,"And he carued all the walles of the house round about with grauen figures of Cherubims and of Palmetrees, and grauen flowres within and without."
11,6,30,"And the floore of the house hee couered with golde within and without."
11,6,31,"And in the entring of the oracle he made two doores of oliue tree: and the vpper post and side postes were fiue square."
11,6,32,"The two doors also [were of] olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid [them] with gold, and"
11,6,33,"And so made he for the doore of the Temple, postes of oliue tree foure square."
11,6,34,"But the two doores were of firre tree, the two sides of the one doore were round, and the two sides of the other doore were round."
11,6,35,"And he graued Cherubims, & palme trees, and carued floures and couered the carued worke with golde, finely wrought."
11,6,36,"And he built the inner"
11,6,37,"In the fourth yeere was the foundation of the house of the Lorde layed in the moneth of Zif:"
11,6,38,"And in the eleventh year, in the month"
11,7,1,"But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he"
11,7,2,"He built also the house"

11,7,4,"And [there were] windows [in] three rows, and light [was]"
11,7,5,"And all the doores, and the side postes with the windowes were foure square, and windowe was ouer against windowe in three rankes."
11,7,6,"And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof [was] fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch [was] before"
11,7,7,"Then he made a porch"
11,7,8,"And in his house, where he dwelt, was an other hall more inwarde then the porche which was of the same worke. Also Salomon made an house for Pharaohs daughter ( whom he had taken to wife) like vnto this porche."
11,7,9,"All these [were of] costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto"
11,7,10,"And the foundation was of costly stones, and great stones, euen of stones of ten cubites, and stones of eight cubites."
11,7,11,"And"
11,7,12,"And the great court round about [was] with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams,"
11,7,13,"Then King Salomon sent, and set one Hiram out of Tyrus."
11,7,14,"He [was] a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father [was] a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and"
11,7,15,"For he cast two pillars of brasse: ye height of a pillar was eighteene cubites, and a threede of twelue cubites did compasse either of ye pillars."
11,7,16,"And he made two chapiters of molten brasse to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of one of the chapiters was fiue cubites, and the height of the other chapiter was fiue cubites."
11,7,17,"He made grates like networke, and wrethen worke like chaynes for the chapiters that were on the top of the pillars, euen seuen for the one chapiter, and seuen for the other chapiter."
11,7,18,"So he made the pillars and two rowes of pomegranates round about in the one grate to couer the chapiters that were vpon the top; thus did he for the other chapiter."
11,7,19,"And the chapiters that [were] upon the top of the pillars [were] of"
11,7,20,"And the chapiters vpon the two pillars had also aboue, ouer against the belly within the networke pomegranates: for two hudreth pomegranates were in the two rankes about vpon either of the chapiters."
11,7,21,"And he set up the pillars in the"
11,7,22,"And vpon the top of the pillars was worke of lilyes: so was the workemanship of the pillars finished."
11,7,23,"And he made a molten"
11,7,24,"And vnder the brimme of it were knoppes like wilde cucumers compassing it round about, ten in one cubite, compassing the sea round about: and the two rowes of knoppes were cast, when it was molten."
11,7,25,"It stoode on twelue bulles, three looking towarde the North, and three toward the West, and three toward the South, and three towarde the East: and the sea stoode aboue vpon them, and all their hinder partes were inward."
11,7,26,"And it [was] an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand"
11,7,27,"And he made tenne bases of brasse, one base was foure cubites long, and foure cubites broad, and three cubites hie."
11,7,28,"And the worke of the bases was on this maner, They had borders, and the borders were betweene the ledges:"
11,7,29,"And on the borders that were betweene the ledges, were lyons, bulles and Cherubims: and vpon the ledges there was a base aboue: and beneath the lyons and bulles, were addicions made of thinne worke."
11,7,30,"And euery base had foure brasen wheeles, and plates of brasse: and the foure corners had vndersetters: vnder the caldron were vndersetters molten at the side of euery addicion."
11,7,31,"And the"
11,7,32,"And vnder the borders were foure wheeles, and the axeltrees of the wheeles ioyned to the base: and the height of a wheele was a cubite and halfe a cubite."
11,7,33,"And the facion of the wheeles was like the facion of a charet wheele, their axeltrees, and their naues and their felloes, and their spokes were all molten."
11,7,34,"And foure vndersetters were vpon the foure corners of one base: and the vndersetters thereof were of the base it selfe."
11,7,35,"And in the top of the base [was there] a round"
11,7,36,"And vpon the tables of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof he did graue Cherubims, lions and palmetrees, on the side of euery one, and addicions round about."
11,7,37,"Thus made he the tenne bases, They had all one casting, one measure, and one syse."
11,7,38,"Then made he"

11,7,45,"And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which"
11,7,46,"In the plaine of Iorden did the King cast them in clay betweene Succoth and Zarthan."
11,7,47,"And Salomon left to weigh all the vessels because of the exceeding aboundance, neyther could the weight of the brasse be counted."
11,7,48,"And Solomon made all the vessels that [pertained] unto the house of the LORD: the"

11,7,51,"So was finished all the worke that King Salomon made for the house of the Lorde, and Salomon brought in the things which Dauid his father had dedicated: the siluer and the golde and the vessels, and layed them among the treasures of the house of the Lord."
11,8,1,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might"
11,8,2,"And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month"

11,8,5,"And King Salomon and all the Congregation of Israel, that were assembled vnto him, were with him before the Arke, offering sheepe and beeues, which could not be tolde, nor nombred for multitude."

11,10,3,"And Salomon declared vnto her all her questions: nothing was hid from the King, which he expounded not vnto her."

11,10,11,"The nauie also of Hiram (that caried gold from Ophir) brought likewise great plentie of Almuggim trees from Ophir & precious stones."
11,10,12,"And the King made of ye Almuggim trees pillars for the house of the Lord, and for ye Kings palace, and made harpes and psalteries for singers. There came no more such Almuggim trees, nor were any more seene vnto this day."
11,10,13,"And King Salomo gaue vnto the Queene of Sheba, whatsoeuer she would aske, besides that, which Salomon gaue her of his kingly liberalitie: so she returned and went to her owne countrey, both shee, and her seruantes."
11,10,14,"Also the weight of golde, that came to Salomon in one yeere, was sixe hundreth three score and six talents of gold,"

11,10,17,"And three hundreth shieldes of beaten golde, three pound of gold went to one shielde: and the King put them in the house of the wood of Lebanon."
11,10,18,"Then the King made a great throne of yuorie, and couered it with the best golde."
11,10,19,"The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne [was] round behind: and [there were]"
11,10,20,"And there stoode twelue lions on the sixe steps on either side: there was not the like made in any kingdome."
11,10,21,"And all King Salomons drinking vessels were of golde, and all the vessels of the house of the woode of Lebanon were of pure golde, none were of siluer: for it was nothing esteemed in the dayes of Salomon."
11,10,22,"For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of"

11,10,24,"And al the world sought to see Salomon, to heare his wisedome, which God had put in his heart,"
11,10,25,"And they brought euery man his present, vessels of siluer, and vessels of golde, and raiment, and armour, and sweete odours, horses & mules, from yeere to yeere."
11,10,26,"Then Salomon gathered together charrets and horsemen: and he had a thousand and foure hundreth charets, and twelue thousande horsemen, whome hee placed in the charet cities, and with the King at Ierusalem."
11,10,27,"And the King gaue siluer in Ierusalem as stones, and gaue cedars as the wilde figtrees that growe abundantly in the plaine."
11,10,28,"Also Salomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and fine linen: the Kings marchants receiued the linen for a price."
11,10,29,"There came vp & went out of Egypt some charet, worth sixe hundreth shekels of siluer: that is, one horse, an hundreth and fiftie and thus they brought horses to all the Kings of the Hittites and to the Kings of Aram by their meanes."

11,11,9,"Therefore the Lord was angry with Salomon, because hee had turned his heart from the Lorde God of Israel, which had appeared vnto him twise,"
11,11,10,"And had giuen him a charge concerning this thing, that he should not follow other gods: but he kept not that, which the Lorde had commaunded him."
11,11,11,"Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as"

11,11,22,"But Pharaoh saide vnto him, What hast thou lacked with me, that thou wouldest thus go to thine owne countrey? And he answered, Nothing, but in any wise let me goe."
11,11,23,"And God stirred him up [another] adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which"

11,11,32,"But he shall haue one tribe for my seruant Dauids sake, and for Ierusalem the citie, which I haue chosen out of all the tribes of Israel,"
11,11,33,"Because they haue forsaken me, and haue worshipped Ashtaroth the god of the Zidonians, and Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and haue not walked in my wayes (to do right in mine eyes, & my statutes, & my lawes) as did Dauid his father."

11,12,14,"And spake to them after the counsell of the yong men, saying, My father made your yoke grieuous, and I will make your yoke more grieuous: my father hath chastised you with rods, but I will correct you with scourges."
11,12,15,"And the King hearkened not vnto the people: for it was the ordinance of the Lorde, that he might perfourme his saying, which the Lorde had spoken by Ahiiah the Shilonite vnto Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat."
11,12,16,"So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in"

11,13,3,"And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This [is] the"

11,13,14,"And went after the man of God, & found him sitting vnder an oke: and he saide vnto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Iudah? And he sayd, Yea."
11,13,15,"Then he said unto him,"
11,13,16,"But he answered, I may not returne with thee, nor go in with thee, neither wil I eate bread nor drinke water with thee in this place."
11,13,17,"For it was charged me by the word of the Lord, saying, Thou shalt eate no bread, nor drinke water there, nor turne againe to goe by the way that thou wentest."
11,13,18,"He said unto him, I [am] a prophet also as thou [art]; and an"

11,13,20,"And as they sate at the table, the worde of the Lorde came vnto the Prophet, that brought him againe."
11,13,21,"And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD,"
11,13,22,"But camest backe againe, and hast eaten bread and drunke water in the place (whereof he did say vnto thee, Thou shalt eate no bread nor drinke any water) thy carkeis shall not come vnto the sepulchre of thy fathers."
11,13,23,"And when he had eaten bread & drunke, he sadled him the asse, to wit, to the Prophet whome he had brought againe."

11,17,18,"And she said vnto Eliiah, What haue I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come vnto me to call my sinne to remembrance, and to slay my sonne?"
11,17,19,"And he said vnto her, Giue me thy sonne; he tooke him out of her bosome, and caryed him vp into a chamber, where he abode, and laid him vpon his owne bed."
11,17,20,"And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also"
11,17,21,"And he stretched himselfe vpon the childe three times, and called vnto the Lord, and saide, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this childes soule come into him againe."
11,17,22,"Then the Lord heard the voyce of Eliiah, and the soule of the child came into him againe, and he reuiued."
11,17,23,"And Eliiah tooke the childe, and brought him downe out of the chamber into the house, and deliuered him vnto his mother, and Eliiah sayd, Behold, thy sonne liueth."
11,17,24,"And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this"

11,18,3,"And Ahab called Obadiah, which [was] the governor of [his] house. (Now Obadiah"
11,18,4,"For when Iezebel destroyed the Prophets of the Lorde, Obadiah tooke an hundreth Prophets, and hid them, by fiftie in a caue, and he fed them with bread and water.)"
11,18,5,"And Ahab saide vnto Obadiah, Goe into the land, vnto all the fountaines of water, and vnto all the riuers, if so be that we may finde grasse to saue the horses and the mules aliue, lest we depriue the lande of the beastes."
11,18,6,"And so they deuided the lande betweene them to walke thorowe it. Ahab went one way by him selfe, and Obadiah went another way by him selfe."
11,18,7,"And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah"
11,18,8,"And he answered him, Yea, goe tell thy lord, Behold, Eliiah is here."
11,18,9,"And he said, What haue I sinned, that thou wouldest deliuer thy seruant into the hande of Ahab, to slay me?"
11,18,10,"As the Lorde thy God liueth, there is no nation or kingdome, whither my lorde hath not sent to seeke thee: and when they sayd, He is not here, he tooke an othe of the kingdome and nation, if they had not found thee."
11,18,11,"And now thou sayest, Goe, tell thy lorde, Beholde, Eliiah is here."
11,18,12,"And it shall come to pass, [as soon as] I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and [so] when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant"
11,18,13,"Was it not tolde my lord, what I did when Iezebel slew the Prophets of the Lord, how I hid an hundreth men of the Lordes Prophets by fifties in a caue, and fed them with bread & water?"
11,18,14,"And now thou sayest, Go, tel thy lord, Behold, Eliiah is here, that he may slay me."
11,18,15,"And Elijah said, [As] the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew"
11,18,16,"So Obadiah went to meete Ahab, and tolde him: And Ahab went to meete Eliiah."
11,18,17,"And when Ahab saw Eliiah, Ahab said vnto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?"
11,18,18,"And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but"
11,18,19,"Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel vnto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal foure hundreth and fiftie, and the prophets of the groues foure hundreth, which eate at Iezebels table."
11,18,20,"So Ahab sent vnto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together vnto mount Carmel."
11,18,21,"And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long"
11,18,22,"Then said Eliiah vnto the people, I onely remayne a Prophet of the Lorde: but Baals prophets are foure hundreth and fiftie men."
11,18,23,"Let them therefore giue vs two bullockes, and let them chuse the one, & cut him in pieces, and lay him on the wood, but put no fire vnder, and I will prepare the other bullocke, and lay him on the wood, and will put no fire vnder."
11,18,24,"And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth"
11,18,25,"And Eliiah said vnto the prophets of Baal, Chuse you a bullocke, and prepare him first, (for ye are many) and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire vnder."
11,18,26,"And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed [it], and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But [there was] no voice, nor any that answered. And they"
11,18,27,"And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he [is] a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, [or] peradventure he sleepeth, and must be"
11,18,28,"And they cryed loude, and cut them selues as their maner was, with kniues and launcers, till the blood gushed out vpon them."
11,18,29,"And when midday was passed, & they had prophecied vntil the offring of the euening sacrifice, there was neither voyce, nor one to answere, nor any that regarded."
11,18,30,"And Eliiah said vnto all the people, Come to me; all the people came to him; he repayred the altar of the Lorde that was broken downe."
11,18,31,"And Eliiah tooke twelue stones, according to the nomber of the tribes of the sonnes of Iaakob, (vnto whome the worde of the Lord came, saying, Israel shalbe thy name)"
11,18,32,"And with the stones he buylt an altar in the Name of the Lorde: and he made a ditch round about the altar, as great as woulde conteine two measures of seede."
11,18,33,"And he put the wood in order, and hewed the bullocke in pieces, & layd him on the wood,"
11,18,34,"And said, Fill foure barrels with water, and powre it on the burnt offring and on the wood. Againe he said, Doe so againe; they did so the second time; he sayde, Doe it the third time; they did it the third time."
11,18,35,"And the water ran round about the altar; and he"
11,18,36,"And when they should offer the euening sacrifice, Eliiah the Prophet came, and sayd, Lord God of Abraham, Izhak and of Israel, let it be knowen this day, that thou art the God of Israel, and that I am thy seruant, and that I haue done all these things at thy commandement."
11,18,37,"Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou [art] the LORD God, and [that] thou hast turned their heart back"
11,18,38,"Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt offring, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked vp the water that was in the ditche."
11,18,39,"And when all the people sawe it, they fell on their faces, and saide, The Lord is God, the Lord is God."
11,18,40,"And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not"
11,18,41,"And Eliiah sayde vnto Ahab, Get thee vp, eate and drinke, for there is a sound of much rayne."
11,18,42,"So Ahab went vp to eate and to drinke, and Eliiah went vp to the top of Carmel: and he crouched vnto the earth, & put his face betweene his knees,"
11,18,43,"And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, [There is] nothing. And he said, Go again"
11,18,44,"And at the seuenth time he sayd, Behold, there ariseth a litle cloude out of the sea like a mans hand. Then he sayd, Vp, and say vnto Ahab, Make readie thy charet, and get thee downe, that the raine stay thee not."
11,18,45,"And in the meane while the heauen was blacke with cloudes and winde, and there was a great rayne. Then Ahab went vp and came to Izreel."
11,18,46,"And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran"
11,19,1,"And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the"
11,19,2,"Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying,"
11,19,3,"When he sawe that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which is in Iudah, and left his seruant there."
11,19,4,"But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD,"
11,19,5,"And as he lay and slept vnder the iuniper tree, behold now, an Angel touched him, and said vnto him, Vp, and eate."
11,19,6,"And when he looked about, behold, there was a cake baken on the coles, and a pot of water at his head: so he did eate and drinke, and returned and slept."
11,19,7,"And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise [and] eat; because"
11,19,8,"Then he arose, and did eate and drinke, and walked in the strength of that meate fourtie dayes and fourtie nights, vnto Horeb the mount of God."
11,19,9,"And there he entred into a caue, & lodged there: and beholde, the Lorde spake to him, and said vnto him, What doest thou here, Eliiah?"
11,19,10,"And he said, I have"
11,19,11,"And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; [but] the LORD [was]"
11,19,12,"And after the earthquake came fire: but the Lorde was not in the fire: and after the fire came a still and soft voyce."
11,19,13,"And when Eliiah heard it, he couered his face with his mantel, and went out, and stoode in the entring in of ye caue: and behold, there came a voyce vnto him, and sayd, What doest thou here, Eliiah?"
11,19,14,"And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts:"
11,19,15,"And the Lord said vnto him, Goe, returne by the wildernes vnto Damascus, and when thou commest there, anoint Hazael King ouer Aram."
11,19,16,"And Iehu the sonne of Nimshi shalt thou anoynt King ouer Israel: and Elisha the sonne of Shaphat of Abel Meholah shalt thou anoynt to be Prophet in thy roume."
11,19,17,"And him that escapeth from the sworde of Hazael, shall Iehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Iehu, shall Elisha slay."
11,19,18,"Yet I have left [me] seven thousand in Israel,"
11,19,19,"So he departed thence, and found Elisha the sonne of Shaphat who was plowing with twelue yoke of oxen before him, and was with the twelft: & Eliiah went towards him, and cast his mantel vpon him."

11,20,7,"Then the King of Israel sent for all the Elders of the land, & sayd, Take heede, I pray you, and see how he seeketh mischiefe: for he sent vnto me for my wiues, and for my children, and for my siluer, and for my golde, and I denyed him not."
11,20,8,"And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken"

11,20,41,"And hee hasted, and tooke the ashes away from his face: and the King of Israel knewe him that he was of the Prophets:"
11,20,42,"And he said vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast let goe out of thine handes a man whom I appoynted to dye, thy life shall goe for his life, and thy people for his people."
11,20,43,"And the King of Israel went to his house heauie and in displeasure, & came to Samaria."
11,21,1,"After these things Naboth the Izreelite had a vineyarde in Izreel, hard by the palace of Ahab King of Samaria."
11,21,2,"And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying,"
11,21,3,"And Naboth said to Ahab, The Lord keepe me from giuing the inheritance of my father vnto thee."
11,21,4,"And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down"
11,21,5,"Then Iezebel his wife came to him & said vnto him, Why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread?"
11,21,6,"And he said vnto her, Because I spake vnto Naboth the Izreelite, & sayd vnto him, Giue me thy vineyard for money, or if it please thee, I will giue thee another vineyard for it: but he answered, I wil not giue thee my vineyarde."
11,21,7,"And Jezebel his wife said unto him,"
11,21,8,"So she wrote letters in Ahabs name, and sealed them with his seale, and sent the letters vnto the Elders, and to the nobles that were in his citie dwelling with Naboth."
11,21,9,"And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a"
11,21,10,"And set two wicked men before him, & let them witnesse against him, saying, Thou diddest blaspheme God and the King: then cary him out, and stone him that he may dye."
11,21,11,"And the"
11,21,12,"They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth among the chiefe of the people,"
11,21,13,"And there came two wicked men, & sate before him: & the wicked men witnessed against Naboth in the presence of the people saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the King. Then they caried him away out of the citie, and stoned him with stones, that he dyed."
11,21,14,"Then they sent to Iezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned and is dead."
11,21,15,"And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab,"
11,21,16,"And when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he rose to go downe to the vineyard of Naboth the Izreelite, to take possession of it."
11,21,17,"And the word of the Lord came vnto Eliiah the Tishbite, saying,"
11,21,18,"Arise, goe downe to meete Ahab King of Israel, which is in Samaria. loe, he is in the vineyarde of Naboth, whither he is gone downe to take possession of it."
11,21,19,"And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD,"
11,21,20,"And Ahab sayd to Eliiah, Hast thou found mee, O mine enemie? And he answered, I haue found thee: for thou hast solde thy selfe to worke wickednes in the sight of the Lord."
11,21,21,"Beholde, I will bring euill vpon thee, and wil take away thy posteritie, and wil cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, as well him that is shut vp, as him that is left in Israel,"
11,21,22,"And I wil make thine house like the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah, for the prouocation wherewith thou hast prouoked, and made Israel to sinne."
11,21,23,"And also of Iezebel spake the Lorde, saying, The dogs shall eate Iezebel, by the wall of Izreel."
11,21,24,"The dogs shall eate him of Ahabs stocke, that dyeth in the citie: and him that dyeth in the fieldes, shall the foules of the ayre eate."
11,21,25,"But there was none like unto Ahab, which did"
11,21,26,"For he did exceeding abominably in following idoles, according to all that the Amorites did, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.)"
11,21,27,"And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went"
11,21,28,"And the worde of the Lord came to Eliiah the Tishbite, saying,"

11,22,1,"And they continued"
11,22,2,"And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah"
11,22,3,"And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that"
11,22,4,"And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel,"
11,22,5,"And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel,"
11,22,6,"Then the king of Israel gathered the"
11,22,7,"And Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the"
11,22,8,"And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but"
11,22,9,"Then the king of Israel called an"
11,22,10,"And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their"

11,22,12,"And all the prophets prophecied so, saying, Goe vp to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliuer it into the Kings hand."
11,22,13,"And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets [declare] good unto the king with"
11,22,14,"And Michaiah saide, As the Lord liueth, whatsoeuer the Lord sayth vnto me, that will I speake."
11,22,15,"So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him,"
11,22,16,"And the King said vnto him, How oft shall I charge thee, that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the Name of the Lord?"
11,22,17,"And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said,"
11,22,18,"(And the King of Israel saide vnto Iehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee, that he would prophecie no good vnto me, but euill?)"
11,22,19,"And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the"
11,22,20,"And the Lord sayd, Who shall entise Ahab that he may go and fall at Ramoth Gilead? And one said on this maner, and another sayd on that maner."
11,22,21,"And there came forth a spirit, and"
11,22,22,"And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a"
11,22,23,"Now therefore behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirite in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Lord hath appoynted euill against thee."
11,22,24,"But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said,"
11,22,25,"And Michaiah saide, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt goe from chamber to chamber to hide thee."
11,22,26,"And the King of Israel sayd, Take Michaiah, and cary him vnto Amon the gouernour of the citie, and vnto Ioash the Kings sonne,"
11,22,27,"And say, Thus saith the king, Put this [fellow] in the prison, and feed him with"
11,22,28,"And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said,"
11,22,29,"So the King of Israel and Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah went vp to Ramoth Gilead."
11,22,30,"And the King of Israel sayde to Iehoshaphat, I will change mine apparell, and will enter into the battell, but put thou on thine apparell; the King of Israel changed himselfe, and went into the battel."
11,22,31,"And the King of Aram commaunded his two and thirtie captaines ouer his charets, saying, Fight neither with small, nor great, saue onely against the King of Israel."
11,22,32,"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it [is] the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat"
11,22,33,"And when the captaines of the charets saw that he was not the King of Israel, they turned backe from him."
11,22,34,"Then a certaine man drewe a bow mightily and smote the King of Israel betweene the ioyntes of his brigandine. Wherefore he sayde vnto his charet man, Turne thine hand and cary me out of the hoste: for I am hurt."
11,22,35,"And the battle increased that day: and the"
11,22,36,"And there went a proclamation throughout the"
11,22,37,"So the King died, and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the King in Samaria."
11,22,38,"And one washed the charet in the poole of Samaria, and the dogs licked vp his blood (and they washed his armour) according vnto the word of the Lord which he spake."
11,22,39,"Concerning the rest of the actes of Ahab and all that he did, and the yuorie house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
11,22,40,"So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his sonne reigned in his stead."
11,22,41,"And Iehoshaphat the sonne of Asa began to reigne vpon Iudah in the fourth yeere of Ahab King of Israel."
11,22,42,"Iehoshaphat was fiue and thirty yere olde, when he began to reigne, and reigned fiue and twentie yeere in Ierusalem; his mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi."
11,22,43,"And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing [that which was] right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless"
11,22,44,"And Iehoshaphat made peace with the King of Israel."
11,22,45,"Concerning the rest of the actes of Iehoshaphat, and his worthy deedes that he did, and his battels which he fought, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah?"
11,22,46,"And the Sodomites, which remayned in the dayes of his father Asa, he put cleane out of the land."
11,22,47,"[There was] then no king in Edom: a"
11,22,48,"Jehoshaphat made ships of"
11,22,49,"Then sayde Ahaziah the sonne of Ahab vnto Iehoshaphat, Let my seruants goe with thy seruants in the ships, But Iehoshaphat would not."
11,22,50,"And Iehoshaphat did sleepe with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the citie of Dauid his father, and Iehoram his sonne reigned in his stead."
11,22,51,"Ahaziah the sonne of Ahab began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria, the seuenteenth yeere of Iehoshaphat King of Iudah, and reigned two yeeres ouer Israel."
11,22,52,"But he did euill in the sight of the Lorde, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, which made Israel to sinne."
11,22,53,"For he serued Baal and worshipped him, and prouoked the Lorde God of Israel vnto wrath, according vnto all that his father had done."
12,1,1,"Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab."
12,1,2,"And"
12,1,3,"But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them,"
12,1,4,"Wherefore thus saith the Lorde, Thou shalt not come downe from the bed on which thou art gone vp, but shalt die the death. So Eliiah departed."
12,1,5,"And the messengers returned vnto him, to whome he said, Why are ye nowe returned?"
12,1,6,"And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD,"
12,1,7,"And he saide vnto them, What maner of man was he which came and met you, and tolde you these wordes?"
12,1,8,"And they answered him, [He was] an"
12,1,9,"Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top"
12,1,10,"And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I [be] a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty."
12,1,11,"Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him,"
12,1,12,"And Elijah answered and said unto them,"
12,1,13,"And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my"
12,1,14,"Beholde, there came fire downe from the heauen and deuoured the two former captaines ouer fiftie with their fifties: therefore let my life nowe be precious in thy sight."
12,1,15,"And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be"
12,1,16,"And he saide vnto him, Thus saith the Lorde, Because thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, (was it not because there was no God in Israel to inquire of his worde?) therefore thou shalt not come downe off the bed, on which thou art gone vp, but shalt die the death."
12,1,17,"So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And"
12,1,18,"Concerning the rest of the actes of Ahaziah, that he did, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?"
12,2,1,"And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from"
12,2,2,"Then Eliiah saide to Elisha, Tarie here, I pray thee: for the Lorde hath sent me to Bethel. But Elisha said, As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came downe to Beth-el."
12,2,3,"And the"
12,2,4,"Againe Eliiah saide vnto him, Elisha, tarie here, I pray thee: for the Lorde hath sent me to Iericho: But he said, As the Lorde liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came to Iericho."
12,2,5,"And the sons of the prophets that [were] at"
12,2,6,"Moreouer Eliiah saide vnto him, Tarie, I pray thee, here: for the Lorde hath sent me to Iorden. But he saide, As the Lorde liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they went both together."
12,2,7,"And fiftie men of the sonnes of the Prophets went and stoode on the other side a farre off, and they two stoode by Iorden."
12,2,8,"And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped [it] together, and smote the"
12,2,9,"And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee,"
12,2,10,"And he saide, Thou hast asked an hard thing: yet if thou see me when I am taken from thee, thou shalt haue it so: & if not, it shal not be."
12,2,11,"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into"
12,2,12,"And Elisha saw it, and he cryed, My father, my father, the charet of Israel, and the horsemen thereof: and he sawe him no more: and he tooke his owne clothes, and rent them in two pieces."
12,2,13,"He tooke vp also the cloke of Eliiah that fell from him, and returned, and stoode by the banke of Iorden."
12,2,14,"After, he tooke the cloke of Eliiah, that fell from him, and smote the waters, and sayde, Where is the Lord God of Eliiah? And so he also, after he had striken the waters, so that they were deuided this way and that way, went ouer, euen Elisha."
12,2,15,"And when the sons of the prophets which [were] to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The"
12,2,16,"And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said,"
12,2,17,"Yet they were instant vpon him, til he was ashamed: wherefore he saide, Sende. So they sent fiftie men, which sought three dayes, but founde him not."
12,2,18,"Therefore they returned to him, (for he taryed at Iericho) and he said vnto them, Did not I say vnto you, Goe not?"
12,2,19,"And the men of the citie saide vnto Elisha, Beholde, we pray thee: the situation of this citie is pleasant, as thou, my lorde, seest, but the water is naught, and the ground baren."
12,2,20,"Then he saide, Bring me a newe cruse, and put salt therein; they brought it to him."
12,2,21,"And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast"
12,2,22,"So the waters were healed vntill this day, according to the worde of Elisha which hee had spoken."
12,2,23,"And he went vp from thence vnto Beth-el; as he was going vp the way, litle children came out of the citie, and mocked him, and saide vnto him, Come vp, thou balde head, come vp, thou balde head."
12,2,24,"And he turned back, and looked on them, and"
12,2,25,"So he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria."
12,3,1,"Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the"

12,3,3,"Nevertheless he cleaved unto the"
12,3,4,"And"
12,3,5,"But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the King of Israel."
12,3,6,"Therefore King Iehoram went out of Samaria the same season, and nombred all Israel,"
12,3,7,"And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up:"
12,3,8,"Then said he, What way shall we goe vp? And he answered, The way of the wildernesse of Edom."
12,3,9,"So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the"
12,3,10,"Therefore the King of Israel sayde, Alas, that the Lord hath called these three Kings, to giue them into the hand of Moab."
12,3,11,"But Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here [is] Elisha the son of Shaphat, which"

12,3,22,"And they rose earely in the morning, when the sunne arose vpon the water, and the Moabites saw the water ouer against them, as red as blood."

12,4,17,"So the woman conceiued, & bare a sonne at that same season, according to the time of life, that Elisha had sayd vnto her."
12,4,18,"And when the childe was growen, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father, and to the reapers."
12,4,19,"And he said unto his father,"

12,4,43,"And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and"
12,4,44,"So he set it before them, and they did eate, and left ouer, according to the word of the Lord."
12,5,1,"Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given"
12,5,2,"And the Aramites had gone out by bands, and had taken a litle mayde of the land of Israel, and shee serued Naamans wife."
12,5,3,"And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord [were] with the"
12,5,4,"And"
12,5,5,"And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and"
12,5,6,"And brought the letter to the King of Israel to this effect, Now when this letter is come vnto thee, vnderstand, that I haue sent thee Naaman my seruant, that thou maiest heale him of his leprosie."
12,5,7,"And when the King of Israel had read the letter, he rent his clothes, and sayde, Am I God, to kil and to giue life, that hee doth send to mee, that I should heale a man from his leprosie? wherfore consider, I pray you, and see howe he seeketh a quarel against me."
12,5,8,"And it was [so], when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying,"
12,5,9,"Then Naaman came with his horses, and with his charets, and stoode at the doore of the house of Elisha."
12,5,10,"And Elisha sent a messenger vnto him, saying, Go and wash thee in Iorden seuen times, and thy flesh shall come againe to thee, and thou shalt be clensed."
12,5,11,"But Naaman was"
12,5,12,"Are not Abanah and Pharpar, riuers of Damascus, better then all the waters of Israel? may I not washe mee in them, and bee cleansed? so hee turned, and departed in displeasure."
12,5,13,"And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said,"
12,5,14,"Then went he downe, and washed him selfe seuen times in Iorden, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came againe, like vnto ye flesh of a litle child, & he was cleane."
12,5,15,"And hee turned againe to the man of God, hee, and all his companie, and came and stood before him, and sayd, Behold, now I knowe that there is no God in all the world, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a reward of thy seruant."
12,5,16,"But he said, [As] the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take [it];"
12,5,17,"Moreouer Naaman sayde, Shall there not be giuen to thy seruant two mules loade of this earth? for thy seruant will henceforth offer neither burnt sacrifice nor offring vnto any other god, saue vnto the Lord."
12,5,18,"In this thing the LORD"
12,5,19,"And he said unto him,"
12,5,20,"And Gehazi the seruant of Elisha the man of God sayde, Beholde, my master hath spared this Aramite Naaman, receiuing not those things at his hand that he brought: as the Lord liueth, I will runne after him, and take somewhat of him."
12,5,21,"So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw [him] running after him,"
12,5,22,"And he answered, All is well: my master hath set me, saying, Behold, there be come to me, euen nowe from mount Ephraim two yong men of the children of the Prophets: giue them, I pray thee, a talent of siluer, & two change of garmets."
12,5,23,"And Naaman saide, Yea, take two talents: and he compelled him, and bound two talents of siluer in two bagges, with two change of garments, and gaue them vnto two of his seruants, that they might beare them before him."
12,5,24,"And when he came to the tower, he took [them] from their hand, and bestowed [them] in the house: and he let the men go, and"
12,5,25,"Then he went in, and stoode before his master; Elisha said vnto him, Whence commest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy seruant went no whither."
12,5,26,"And he said unto him,"
12,5,27,"The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy"
12,6,1,"And the children of the Prophets saide vnto Elisha, Behold, we pray thee, the place where we dwell with thee, is too litle for vs."
12,6,2,"Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a"
12,6,3,"And one said, Vouchsafe, I pray thee, to go with thy seruants, and he answered, I will goe."
12,6,4,"So he went with them, & when they came to Iorden, they cut downe wood."
12,6,5,"And as one was felling of a tree, the yron fell into the water: then he cryed, and said, Alas master, it was but borowed."
12,6,6,"And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast [it] in thither; and the iron did"
12,6,7,"Then he saide, Take it vp to thee; he stretched out his hand, and tooke it."
12,6,8,"Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In"
12,6,9,"Therefore the man of God sent vnto the King of Israel, saying, Beware thou goe not ouer to such a place: for there the Aramites are come downe."
12,6,10,"And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and"
12,6,11,"And the heart of the King of Aram was troubled for this thing: therefore he called his seruants and saide vnto them, Will ye not shewe me, which of vs bewrayeth our counsel to the king of Israel?"
12,6,12,"And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that [is] in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy"
12,6,13,"And he said, Goe, and espie where he is, that I may sende and fetch him; one tolde him, saying, Beholde, he is in Dothan."
12,6,14,"Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a"
12,6,15,"And when the seruant of the man of God arose earely to goe out, beholde, an hoste compassed the citie with horses and charets. Then his seruant sayde vnto him, Alas master, howe shall we doe?"
12,6,16,"And he answered,"
12,6,17,"And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,"
12,6,18,"And when"

12,6,22,"And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: doest thou not smite them that thou hast taken with thy sworde, and with thy bowe? but set bread and water before them, that they may eate and drinke and goe to their master."
12,6,23,"And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no"

12,6,26,"And as the King of Israel was going vpon the wall, there cryed a woman vnto him, saying, Helpe, my lord, O King."
12,6,27,"And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the"
12,6,28,"Also the King said vnto her, What ayleth thee? And she answered, This woman sayde vnto me, Giue thy sonne, that we may eate him to day, and we will eate my sonne to morowe,"
12,6,29,"So we sod my sonne, and did eate him: & I saide to her the day after, Giue thy sonne, that we may eate him, but she hath hid her sonne."
12,6,30,"And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, [he had] sackcloth within"
12,6,31,"And he saide, God doe so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the sonne of Shaphat shall stande on him this day."
12,6,32,"But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and [the king] sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a"

12,7,5,"So they rose vp in the twilight, to goe to the campe of the Aramites: and when they were come to the vtmost part of the campe of the Aramites, loe, there was no man there."
12,7,6,"For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a"

12,7,8,"And when these lepers came to the vtmost part of the campe, they entred into one tent, and did eate and drinke, and caryed thence siluer and golde, and raiment, and went and hid it: after they returned, and entred into another tent, and caryed thence also, and went and hid it."
12,7,9,"Then saide one to another, We doe not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we holde our peace. If we tary till day light, some mischiefe will come vpon vs. Nowe therefore, come, let vs goe, and tell the Kings housholde."
12,7,10,"So they came, and called vnto the porters of the citie, and tolde them, saying, We came to the campe of the Aramites, and loe, there was no man there, neither voyce of man, but horses tyed and asses tyed: and the tents are as they were."
12,7,11,"And the porters cryed and declared to the Kings house within."
12,7,12,"And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants,"
12,7,13,"And one of his servants answered and said, Let [some] take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they [are] as all the"

12,7,15,"And they went after them vnto Iorden, and loe, all the way was full of clothes and vessels which the Aramites had cast from them in their hast: & the messengers returned, and told ye King."
12,7,16,"And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was [sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel,"
12,7,17,"And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people"
12,7,18,"And it came to passe, as the man of God had spoken to the King, saying, Two measures of barley at a shekel, and a measure of fine floure shall be at a shekel, to morowe about this time in the gate of Samaria."
12,7,19,"But the prince had answered the man of God, and saide, Though the Lorde would make windowes in the heauen, coulde it come so to passe? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not eate thereof."
12,7,20,"And so it came vnto him: for the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he dyed."

12,8,12,"And Hazael sayde, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I knowe the euill that thou shalt do vnto the children of Israel: for their strong cities shalt thou set on fire, and their yong men shalt thou slay with the sworde, and shalt dash their infantes against the stones, and rent in pieces their women with child."
12,8,13,"And Hazael said, But what, [is] thy servant"

12,10,6,"Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye [be] mine, and [if] ye will hearken unto my voice,"

12,18,8,"He smote the Philistines, [even] unto Gaza, and the borders thereof,"
12,18,9,"And in the fourth yere of King Hezekiah, (which was the seuenth yeere of Hoshea sonne of Elah King of Israel) Shalmaneser King of Asshur came vp against Samaria, and besieged it."
12,18,10,"And after three yeeres they tooke it, euen in the sixt yeere of Hezekiah: that is, the ninth yeere of Hoshea King of Israel was Samaria taken."
12,18,11,"Then the King of Asshur did carry away Israel vnto Asshur, and put them in Halah and in Habor, by the riuer of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,"
12,18,12,"Because they woulde not obey the voyce of the Lord their God, but transgressed his couenant: that is, all that Moses the seruant of the Lord had commanded, and would neyther obey nor doe them."
12,18,13,"Moreouer, in the fourteenth yeere of King Hezekiah, Saneherib King of Asshur came vp against all the strong cities of Iudah, and tooke them."

12,18,28,"So Rabshakeh stoode and cryed with a loude voyce in the Iewes language, and spake, saying, Heare the wordes of the great King, of the king of Asshur."
12,18,29,"Thus sayth the King, Let not Hezekiah deceiue you: for he shall not be able to deliuer you out of mine hand."
12,18,30,"Neither let Hezekiah make you to trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will surely deliuer vs, and this citie shall not be giuen ouer into the hand of the king of Asshur."
12,18,31,"Hearken not vnto Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Asshur, Make appointment with me, and come out to me, that euery man may eate of his owne vine, & euery man of his owne figge tree, and drinke euery man of the water of his owne well,"

13,17,12,"He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for"

13,17,15,"According to all these wordes, and according to al this vision. So Nathan spake to Dauid."
13,17,16,"And David the king"
13,17,17,"And [yet] this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast [also] spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of"

13,17,19,"O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own"
13,17,20,"Lorde, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we haue heard with our eares."
13,17,21,"Moreouer what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whose God went to redeeme them to be his people, and to make thy selfe a Name, and to doe great and terrible things by casting out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast deliuered out of Egypt?"
13,17,22,"For thou hast ordeined thy people Israel to be thine owne people for euer, and thou Lord art become their God."
13,17,23,"Therefore nowe Lorde, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy seruant & concerning his house, be confirmed for euer, and doe as thou hast sayd,"

13,17,27,"Now therfore, it hath pleased thee to blesse the house of thy seruant, that it may bee before thee for euer: for thou, O Lord, hast blessed it, and it shalbe blessed for euer."
13,18,1,"Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took"
13,18,2,"And he smote Moab, and the Moabites became Dauids seruants, and brought giftes."
13,18,3,"And Dauid smote Hadarezer King of Zobah vnto Hamath, as he went to stablish his border by the riuer Perath."
13,18,4,"And Dauid tooke from him a thousand charets, and seuen thousand horsemen, and twentie thousand footemen, and destroyed all the charets, but he reserued of them an hundreth charets."
13,18,5,"Then came the Aramites of Damascus to succour Hadarezer King of Zobah, but Dauid slewe of the Aramites two and twentie thousand."
13,18,6,"Then David put [garrisons] in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, [and] brought gifts. Thus the LORD"
13,18,7,"And Dauid tooke the shieldes of gold that were of the seruants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Ierusalem."
13,18,8,"Likewise from"

13,18,13,"And he put a garison in Edom, and all the Edomites became Dauids seruantes: and the Lord preserued Dauid wheresoeuer he went."
13,18,14,"So Dauid reigned ouer all Israel, and executed iudgement and iustice to all his people."
13,18,15,"And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah was ouer the hoste, and Iehoshaphat the sonne of Ahilud recorder,"
13,18,16,"And Zadok the sonne of Ahitub, and Abimelech the sonne of Abiathar were the Priests, & Shausha the Scribe,"

13,19,5,"And there went certaine and tolde Dauid concerning the men: and he sent to meete them (for the men were exceedingly ashamed) and the King saide, Tarie at Iericho, vntill your beardes be growen: then returne."
13,19,6,"And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of"
13,19,7,"So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before"
13,19,8,"And when Dauid heard, he sent Ioab and all the hoste of the valiant men."
13,19,9,"And the children of Ammon came out, and set their battell in aray at the gate of the citie; the Kings that were come, were by them selues in the fielde."
13,19,10,"When Ioab saw that the front of the battel was against him before and behinde, then he chose out of all the choyse of Israel, and set him selfe in aray to meete the Aramites."
13,19,11,"And the rest of the people he deliuered vnto the hande of Abishai his brother, and they put them selues in aray against the children of Ammon."
13,19,12,"And he saide, If Aram be too strong for me, then thou shalt succour me: and if the children of Ammon preuaile against thee, then I wil succour thee."
13,19,13,"Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our"
13,19,14,"So Ioab and the people that was with him, came neere before the Aramites vnto the battel, and they fled before him."
13,19,15,"And when the children of Ammon sawe that the Aramites fled, they fled also before Abishai his brother, and entred into the citie: so Ioab came to Ierusalem."
13,19,16,"And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that [were] beyond the"
13,19,17,"And when it was shewed Dauid, he gathered all Israel, and went ouer Iorden, and came vnto them, & put him selfe in aray against them: And when Dauid had put him selfe in battel aray to meete the Aramites, they fought with him."
13,19,18,"But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians"
13,19,19,"And when the seruants of Hadarezer sawe that they fell before Israel, they made peace with Dauid, and serued him; the Aramites would no more succour the children of Ammon."
13,20,1,"And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out [to battle], Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged"
13,20,2,"And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a"
13,20,3,"And he caryed away the people that were in it, and cut them with sawes, and with harowes of yron, and with axes: euen thus did Dauid with all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then Dauid and all the people came againe to Ierusalem."
13,20,4,"And after this also there arose warre at Gezer with the Philistims: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slewe Sippai, of the children of Haraphah, and they were subdued."
13,20,5,"And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew"
13,20,6,"And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of [great] stature, whose fingers and toes [were] four and twenty,"
13,20,7,"And when he reuiled Israel, Iehonathan the sonne of Shimea Dauids brother did slay him."
13,20,8,"These were borne vnto Haraphah at Gath, and fell by the hand of Dauid: and by the hands of his seruants."
13,21,1,"And"
13,21,2,"And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from"
13,21,3,"And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they [be]: but, my lord the king, [are] they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of"
13,21,4,"Neuerthelesse the Kings word preuailed against Ioab; Ioab departed and went thorowe all Israel, and returned to Ierusalem."
13,21,5,"And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all [they of] Israel were"
13,21,6,"But the Leuites and Beniamin counted he not among them: for the Kings worde was abominable to Ioab."
13,21,7,"And God was displeased with this thing: therefore he smote Israel."
13,21,8,"Then Dauid saide vnto God, I haue sinned greatly, because I haue done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, remooue the iniquitie of thy seruant: for I haue done very foolishly."
13,21,9,"And the Lorde spake vnto Gad Dauids Seer, saying,"
13,21,10,"Goe and tell Dauid, saying, Thus saith the Lorde, I offer thee three thinges: choose thee one of them, that I may doe it vnto thee."
13,21,11,"So Gad came to Dauid, and sayde vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Take to thee"
13,21,12,"Either three yeeres famine, or three moneths to be destroyed before thine aduersaries, and the sworde of thine enemies to take thee, or els the sworde of the Lorde and pestilence in the lande three dayes, that the Angel of the Lorde may destroy throughout all the coastes of Israel: nowe therefore aduise thee, what word I shal bring againe to him that sent me."
13,21,13,"And Dauid said vnto Gad, I am in a wonderfull strait. Let me nowe fall into the hande of the Lorde: for his mercies are exceeding great, and let me not fall into the hande of man."
13,21,14,"So the Lord sent a pestilence in Israel, and there fell of Israel seuentie thousande men."
13,21,15,"And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and"
13,21,16,"And Dauid lift vp his eyes, and sawe the Angel of the Lorde stande betweene the earth and the heauen with his sworde drawen in his hand, and stretched out towarde Ierusalem. Then Dauid and the Elders of Israel, which were clothed in sacke, fell vpon their faces."
13,21,17,"And David said unto God, [Is it] not I [that] commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but [as for] these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on"
13,21,18,"Then the Angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to Dauid, that Dauid should goe vp, and set vp an altar vnto the Lord in the thresshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite."
13,21,19,"So Dauid went vp according to the saying of Gad, which he had spoken in the Name of the Lorde."
13,21,20,"And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him"
13,21,21,"And as Dauid came to Ornan, Ornan looked and sawe Dauid, and went out of the thresshing floore, and bowed himselfe to Dauid with his face to the grounde."
13,21,22,"Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of [this] threshingfloor, that I may build an"
13,21,23,"Then Ornan saide vnto Dauid, Take it to thee, and let my lord the King do that which seemeth him good: loe, I giue thee bullockes for burnt offrings, and thresshing instruments for wood, and wheat for meate offring, I giue it all."
13,21,24,"And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full"
13,21,25,"So David gave to Ornan for the place"
13,21,26,"And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he"
13,21,27,"And when the Lorde had spoken to the Angel, he put vp his sworde againe into his sheath."
13,21,28,"At that time when Dauid sawe that the Lorde had heard him in the thresshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite, then he sacrificed there."
13,21,29,"(But the Tabernacle of the Lorde which Moses had made in the wildernesse, and the altar of burnt offring were at that season in the hie place at Gibeon."
13,21,30,"And Dauid could not go before it to aske counsel at God: for he was afraide of the sworde of the Angel of the Lorde.)"
13,22,1,"Then David said, This [is] the"
13,22,2,"And David commanded to gather together the"
13,22,3,"And David prepared iron"
13,22,4,"And cedar trees without nomber: for the Zidonians and they of Tyrus brought much cedar wood to Dauid."
13,22,5,"And Dauid saide, Salomon my sonne is yong and tender, and we must builde an house for the Lorde, magnificall, excellent and of great fame and dignitie throughout all countreyes. I will therefore nowe prepare for him. So Dauid prepared very much before his death."
13,22,6,"Then he called Salomon his sonne, and charged him to builde an house for the Lorde God of Israel."
13,22,7,"And Dauid said to Salomon, My sonne, I purposed with my selfe to builde an house to the Name of the Lorde my God,"
13,22,8,"But the word of the LORD came to me, saying,"
13,22,9,"Beholde, a sonne is borne to thee, which shalbe a man of rest, for I will giue him rest from all his enemies rounde about: therefore his name is Salomon: and I will sende peace and quietnes vpon Israel in his dayes."
13,22,10,"Hee shall builde an house for my Name, and he shalbe my sonne, and I will be his father, and I will establish the throne of his kingdome vpon Israel for euer."
13,22,11,"Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and"
13,22,12,"Only the LORD give thee"
13,22,13,"Then thou shalt prosper, if thou take heede to obserue the statutes and the iudgements which the Lorde commanded Moses for Israel: be strong and of good courage: feare not, neither bee afraide."
13,22,14,"Now, behold, in my"

13,22,16,"Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, [there is] no number."
13,22,17,"Dauid also commanded all the princes of Israel to helpe Salomon his sonne, saying,"
13,22,18,"[Is] not the LORD your God with you? and hath he [not] given you rest on every side? for he hath given the"
13,22,19,"Now set"
13,23,1,"So when Dauid was olde and full of dayes, he made Salomon his sonne King ouer Israel."
13,23,2,"And hee gathered together all the princes of Israel with the Priestes and the Leuites."
13,23,3,"And the Leuites were numbred from ye age of thirtie yeere and aboue, and their nomber according to their summe was eight & thirtie thousand men."
13,23,4,"Of these foure and twentie thousande were set to aduance the worke of the house of the Lord, & sixe thousand were ouerseers and iudges."
13,23,5,"And foure thousand were porters, and foure thousande praised the Lorde with instruments which he made to praise the Lord."
13,23,6,"So Dauid deuided offices vnto them, to wit, to the sonnes of Leui, to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari."
13,23,7,"Of the Gershonites were Laadan & Shimei."
13,23,8,"The sonnes of Laadan, the chiefe was Iehiel, and Zetham and Ioel, three."
13,23,9,"The Sonnes of Shimei, Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haram, three: these were the chiefe fathers of Laadan."
13,23,10,"Also the sonnes of Shimei were Iahath, Zina, Ieush, and Beriah: these foure were ye sonnes of Shimei."
13,23,11,"And Iahath was the chiefe, and Zizah the seconde, but Ieush and Beriah had not many sonnes: therfore they were in the families of their father, counted but as one."
13,23,12,"The sonnes of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron aud Vzziel, foure."
13,23,13,"The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should"

13,23,20,"The sones of Vzziel were Michah the first, and Isshiah the second."
13,23,21,"The sonnes of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The sonnes of Mahli, Eleazar and Kish."
13,23,22,"And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their"
13,23,23,"The sonnes of Mushi were Mahli, & Eder, and Ierimoth, three."
13,23,24,"These [were] the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; [even] the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of"

13,23,26,"And also the Leuites shall no more beare the Tabernacle and al the vessels for the seruice thereof."
13,23,27,"Therefore according to the last wordes of Dauid, the Leuites were nombred from twentie yeere and aboue,"
13,23,28,"Because their office [was] to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the"

13,23,32,"And that they should keepe the charge of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the charge of ye holy place, & the charge of ye sonnes of Aaron their brethren in the seruice of ye house of the Lord."
13,24,1,"These are also the diuisions of the sonnes of Aaron: The sonnes of Aaron were Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar."
13,24,2,"But Nadab and Abihu died"
13,24,3,"And Dauid distributed them, euen Zadok of the sonnes of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sonnes of Ithamar according to their offices in their ministration."

13,24,5,"Thus they distributed them by lot the one from the other, and so the rulers of the Sanctuarie and the rulers of the house of God were of the sonnes of Eleazar and of the sonnes of Ithamar."
13,24,6,"And Shemaiah the sonne of Nethaneel the scribe of the Leuites, wrote them before ye King and the princes, and Zadok the Priest, and Ahimelech the sonne of Abiathar, and before ye chiefe fathers of the Priests and of the Leuites, one familie being reserued for Eleazar, and another reserued for Ithamar."

14,5,2,"Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the"

14,5,5,"And they caried vp the Arke and the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and all the holy vessels that were in the Tabernacle, those did the Priests and Leuites bring vp."
14,5,6,"And King Salomon & all the Congregation of Israel that were assembled vnto him, were before ye Arke, offring sheepe & bullocks, which could not be told nor nobred for multitude."
14,5,7,"So the Priests brought the Arke of the couenant of the Lord vnto his place, into the Oracle of the house, into the most Holy place, euen vnder the wings of the Cherubims."
14,5,8,"For ye Cherubims stretched out their wings ouer the place of the Arke, and the Cherubims couered the Arke and the barres thereof aboue."
14,5,9,"And they drewe out the barres, that the endes of the barres might bee seene out of the Arke before the Oracle, but they were not seene without: and there they are vnto this day."
14,5,10,"[There was] nothing in the ark save"
14,5,11,"And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy [place]: (for all the priests [that were] present were"
14,5,12,"And the Leuites the singers of all sortes, as of Asaph, of Heman, of Ieduthun, and of their sonnes and of their brethren, being clad in fine linen, stoode with cymbales, and with violes and harpes at the East ende of the altar, and with them an hundreth and twentie Priestes blowing with trumpets:"
14,5,13,"It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers [were]"
14,5,14,"So that the Priests could not stand to minister, because of the cloude: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God."
14,6,1,"Then"
14,6,2,"And I haue built thee an house to dwell in, an habitation for thee to dwell in for euer."
14,6,3,"And the King turned his face, and blessed all the Congregation of Israel (for all the Congregation of Israel stoode there )"
14,6,4,"And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spake with his mouth vnto Dauid my father, & hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,"
14,6,5,"Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no citie of al the tribes of Israel to buylde an house, that my Name might be there, neyther chose I any man to be a ruler ouer my people Israel:"
14,6,6,"But I haue chosen Ierusalem, that my Name might be there, & haue chosen Dauid to be ouer my people Israel."
14,6,7,"And it was in the heart of Dauid my father to builde an house vnto the Name of the Lord God of Israel,"
14,6,8,"But the Lorde sayde to Dauid my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to buylde an house vnto my Name, thou diddest well, that thou wast so minded."
14,6,9,"Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house, but thy sonne which shall come out of thy loynes, he shall buylde an house vnto my Name."
14,6,10,"And the Lorde hath performed his worde that he spake: and I am risen vp in the roume of Dauid my father, and am set on the throne of Israel as the Lord promised, & haue built an house to the Name of the Lord God of Israel."
14,6,11,"And in it have I put the ark, wherein [is] the"
14,6,12,"And"
14,6,13,"For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and"

14,6,15,"Thou that hast kept with thy seruant Dauid my father, that thou hast promised him: for thou spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as appeareth this day."
14,6,16,"Therefore now Lord God of Israel, keepe with thy seruant Dauid my father, that thou hast promised him, saying, Thou shalt not want a man in my sight, that shall sit vpon the throne of Israel: so that thy sonnes take heede to their wayes, to walke in my Lawe, as thou hast walked before me."
14,6,17,"And now, O Lorde God of Israel, let thy worde be verified, which thou spakest vnto thy seruant Dauid."
14,6,18,"(Is it true in deede that God will dwell with man on earth? beholde, the heauens, and the heauens of heauens are not able to conteine thee: how much more vnable is this house, which I haue buylt?)"
14,6,19,"But haue thou respect to the prayer of thy seruant, and to his supplication, O Lord my God, to heare the crye and prayer which thy seruant prayeth before thee,"
14,6,20,"That thine"
14,6,21,"Heare thou therefore the supplication of thy seruant, and of thy people Israel, which they pray in this place: and heare thou in the place of thine habitation, euen in heauen, and when thou hearest, be mercifull."
14,6,22,"If a man sin against his"
14,6,23,"Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way"
14,6,24,"And when thy people Israel shalbe ouerthrowen before the enemie, because they haue sinned against thee, and turne againe, and confesse thy Name, and pray, and make supplication before thee in this house,"
14,6,25,"Then heare thou in heauen, and be mercifull vnto the sinne of thy people Israel, and bring them againe vnto the land which thou gauest to them and to their fathers."
14,6,26,"When heauen shall be shut vp, and there shalbe no rayne, because they haue sinned against thee, and shall pray in this place, and confesse thy Name, and turne from their sinne, when thou doest afflict them,"
14,6,27,"Then heare thou in heauen, and pardon the sinne of thy seruants, and of thy people Israel (when thou hast taught them the good way wherein they may walke) and giue rayne vpon thy lande, which thou hast giuen vnto thy people for an inheritance."
14,6,28,"When there shalbe famine in the land, when there shalbe pestilence, blasting, or mildew, when there shall be grashopper, or caterpiller, when their enemie shall besiege them in the cities of their land, or any plague or any sickenesse,"
14,6,29,"Then what prayer and supplication so euer shalbe made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, whe euery one shall knowe his owne plague, and his owne disease, and shall stretch forth his hands toward this house,"

14,6,33,"Heare thou in heauen thy dwelling place, and doe according to all that the stranger calleth for vnto thee, that all the people of the earth may knowe thy Name, and feare thee like thy people Israel, and that they may knowe, that thy Name is called vpon in this house which I haue built."
14,6,34,"If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that"
14,6,35,"Then heare thou in heauen their prayer & their supplication, and iudge their cause."
14,6,36,"If they sinne against thee ( for there is no man that sinneth not) and thou be angry with them and deliuer them vnto the enemies, and they take them and cary them away captiue vnto a land farre or neere,"
14,6,37,"If they turne againe to their heart in the lande whither they be caryed in captiues, and turne and pray vnto thee in the lande of their captiuitie, saying, We haue sinned, we haue transgressed and haue done wickedly,"
14,6,38,"If they turne againe to thee with all their heart, and with all their soule in the land of their captiuitie, whither they haue caryed them captiues, and pray toward their land, which thou gauest vnto their fathers, & toward the citie which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I haue built for thy Name,"
14,6,39,"Then heare thou in heauen, in the place of thine habitation their prayer and their supplication, and iudge their cause, and be mercifull vnto thy people, which haue sinned against thee."
14,6,40,"Nowe my God, I beseech thee, let thine eyes be open, & thine eares attent vnto the prayer that is made in this place."
14,6,41,"Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy"

14,7,3,"And when all the children of Israel saw the fire, and the glory of the Lord come downe vpon the house, they bowed themselues with their faces to the earth vpon the pauement, and worshipped and praysed the Lord, saying, For he is good, because his mercy lasteth for euer."
14,7,4,"Then the King and all the people offred sacrifices before the Lord."
14,7,5,"And King Salomon offered a sacrifice of two and twentie thousand bullockes, and an hundreth and twentie thousand sheepe. so the King and all the people dedicated the house of God."
14,7,6,"And the Priests waited on their offices, and the Leuites with the instruments of musicke of the Lorde, which King Dauid had made to praise the Lord, Because his mercy lasteth for euer: whe Dauid praysed God by them, the Priestes also blewe trumpets ouer against them: and all they of Israel stoode by."
14,7,7,"Moreouer Salomon halowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord: for there hee had prepared burnt offerings, and the fatte of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Salomon had made, was not able to receiue the burnt offering, and the meate offring, and the fat."
14,7,8,"Also at the same time Solomon kept"

14,7,12,"And the Lord appeared to Salomon by night and said to him, I haue heard thy prayer, and haue chosen this place for my selfe to be an house of sacrifice."
14,7,13,"If I shut the heauen that there be no raine, or if I commaunde the grashopper to deuoure the lande, or if I sende pestilence among my people,"
14,7,14,"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will"
14,7,15,"Then mine eies shalbe open & mine eares attent vnto the prayer made in this place."
14,7,16,"For I haue nowe chosen and sanctified this house, that my Name may be there for euer: and mine eyes & mine heart shalbe there perpetually."
14,7,17,"And if thou wilt walke before me, as Dauid thy father walked, to doe according vnto all that I haue commanded thee, and shalt obserue my statutes and my iudgements,"
14,7,18,"Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdome, according as I made the couenant with Dauid thy father, saying, Thou shalt not want a man to be ruler in Israel."
14,7,19,"But if ye turne away, and forsake my statutes and my commandements which I haue set before you, and shall goe and serue other gods, and worshippe them,"
14,7,20,"Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have"
14,7,21,"And this house which is most hie, shall be an astonishment to euery one that passeth by it, so that he shall say, Why hath the Lorde done thus to this lande, and to this house?"
14,7,22,"And they shall answere, Because they forsooke the Lorde God of their fathers, which brought them out of the lande of Egypt, and haue taken holde on other gods, and haue worshipped them, and serued them, therefore hath he brought all this euill vpon them."
14,8,1,"And it came to pass at the end of"
14,8,2,"That the cities which Huram had"
14,8,3,"And Salomon went to Hamath Zobah, and ouercame it."
14,8,4,"And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the"
14,8,5,"Also he built"
14,8,6,"Also Baalath, and al the cities of store that Salomon had, and all the charet cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and euery pleasaunt place that Salomon had a minde to builde in Ierusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the lande of his dominion."
14,8,7,"And all the people that were left to ye Hittites, and ye Amorites, and Perizzites, and the Hiuuites, and the Iebusites, which were not of Israel,"
14,8,8,"But of their children which were left after them in the lande, whome the children of Israel had not consumed, euen them did Salomon make tributaries vntill this day."
14,8,9,"But of the children of Israel did Salomon make no seruantes for his worke: for they were men of warre, and his chiefe princes, and the captaines of his charets and of his horsemen."
14,8,10,"And these [were] the chief of king Solomon's officers, [even]"
14,8,11,"Then Salomon brought vp the daughter of Pharaoh out of the citie of Dauid, into the house that he had built for her: for he saide, My wife shall not dwel in the house of Dauid King of Israel: for it is holy, because that the Arke of the Lorde came vnto it."
14,8,12,"Then Salomon offered burnt offrings vnto the Lord, on the altar of the Lorde, which he had built before the porche,"
14,8,13,"Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts,"
14,8,14,"And he set the courses of the Priestes to their offices, according to the order of Dauid his father, and the Leuites in their watches, for to praise and minister before the Priestes euery day, and the porters by their courses, at euery gate: for so was the commandement of Dauid the man of God."
14,8,15,"And they declined not from the commandement of the King, concerning the Priests and the Leuites, touching al things, and touching the treasures."
14,8,16,"Now all the"

14,9,1,"And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to"
14,9,2,"And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was"
14,9,3,"Then the Queene of Sheba sawe the wisedome of Salomon, and the house that he had buylt,"
14,9,4,"And the meate of his table, and the sitting of his seruants, and the order of his wayters, and their apparel, and his butlers, and their apparel, & his burnt offrings which he offred in the house of the Lorde, and she was greatly astonied."
14,9,5,"And she saide to the King, It was a true worde which I heard in mine owne lande of thy sayings, and of thy wisedome:"
14,9,6,"Howbeit I beleeued not their report, vntil I came, and mine eyes had seene it: & beholde, the one halfe of thy great wisedom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard."
14,9,7,"Happie are thy men, and happie are these thy seruants, which stande before thee alway, and heare thy wisedome."
14,9,8,"Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his"

14,9,10,"And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought"
14,9,11,"And the king made [of] the algum trees"
14,9,12,"And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked,"
14,9,13,"Also the weight of golde that came to Salomon in one yeere, was sixe hundreth three score and sixe talents of golde,"
14,9,14,"Besides that which chapmen and marchants brought: and all the Kings of Arabia, and the princes of the countrey brought golde and siluer to Salomon."
14,9,15,"And king Solomon made two hundred targets [of] beaten gold:"
14,9,16,"And three hundreth shieldes of beaten golde: three hundreth shekels of golde went to one shielde, and the King put them in the house of the wood of Lebanon."
14,9,17,"And the King made a great throne of yuorie and ouerlaid it with pure golde."
14,9,18,"And [there were] six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, [which were]"
14,9,19,"And twelue lyons stoode there on the sixe steps on either side: there was not the like made in any kingdome."
14,9,20,"And all King Salomons drinking vessels were of golde, and all the vessels of the house of the wood of Lebanon were of pure gold: for siluer was nothing esteemed in ye dayes of Salomo."
14,9,21,"For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of"

14,9,24,"And they brought euery man his present, vessels of siluer, and vessels of golde, and raiment, armour, and sweet odours, horses, and mules, from yeere to yeere."
14,9,25,"And Solomon had"
14,9,26,"And he reigned ouer all the Kings from the Riuer euen vnto the land of the Philistims, and to the border of Egypt."
14,9,27,"And the king made silver in Jerusalem"
14,9,28,"And they brought vnto Salomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all landes."
14,9,29,"Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, [are] they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer"
14,9,30,"And Salomon reigned in Ierusalem ouer all Israel fourtie yeeres."
14,9,31,"And Salomon slept with his fathers, and they buryed him in the citie of Dauid his father: and Rehoboam his sonne reigned in his steade."
14,10,1,"And Rehoboam"
14,10,2,"And when Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat heard it, (which was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Salomon the King) he returned out of Egypt."
14,10,3,"And they sent and called him: so came Ieroboam and all Israel, and communed with Rehoboam, saying,"
14,10,4,"Thy father"
14,10,5,"And he sayde to them, Depart yet three dayes, then come againe vnto me; the people departed."
14,10,6,"And King Rehoboam tooke counsel with the olde men that had stande before Salomon his father, while hee yet liued, saying, What counsell giue ye that I may answere this people?"
14,10,7,"And they spake vnto him, saying, If thou be kinde to this people, and please them, and speake louing words to them, they will be thy seruants for euer."
14,10,8,"But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that"
14,10,9,"And he sayd vnto them, What counsel giue ye, that we may answere this people, which haue spoken to mee, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put vpon vs, lighter?"
14,10,10,"And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou [it] somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My"
14,10,11,"Now whereas my father did burden you with a grieuous yoke, I will yet increase your yoke: my father hath chastised you with roddes, but I will correct you with scourges."
14,10,12,"Then Ieroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the King had appointed saying, Come againe to me the third day."
14,10,13,"And the King answered them sharply: and King Rehoboam left the counsel of the ancient men,"
14,10,14,"And spake to them after ye counsell of the yong men, saying, My father made your yoke grieuous, but I wil incease it: my father chastised you with rods, but I will correct you with scourges."
14,10,15,"So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the"
14,10,16,"So when all Isarael sawe that the King would not heare them, the people answered the King, saying, What portion haue we in Dauid? for we haue none inheritance in the sonue of Ishai. O Israel, euery man to your tents: now see to thine owne house, Dauid. So all Israel departed to their tents."
14,10,17,"Howbeit Rehoboam reigned ouer the children of Israel, that dwelt in the cities of Iudah."
14,10,18,"Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was ouer the tribute, and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died: then King Rehoboham made speede to get him vp to his charet, to flee to Ierusalem."
14,10,19,"And Israel rebelled against the house of Dauid vnto this day."
14,11,1,"And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and"
14,11,2,"But the worde of the Lorde came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,"
14,11,3,"Speake vnto Rehoboam, the sonne of Salomon King of Iudah, and to all Israel that are in Iudah, and Beniamin, saying,"
14,11,4,"Thus sayth the Lorde, Ye shall not goe vp, nor fight against your brethren: returne euery man to his house: for this thing is done of me. They obeyed therfore the word of the Lord, and returned from going against Ieroboam."
14,11,5,"And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and"

14,11,11,"And he repaired the strong holdes and put captaines in them, and store of vitaile, and oyle and wine."
14,11,12,"And in all cities he put shieldes & speares, and made them exceeding strong: so Iudah and Beniamin were his."
14,11,13,"And the Priests and the Leuites that were in all Israel, resorted vnto him out of all their coastes."
14,11,14,"For the Leuites left their suburbes & their possession, and came to Iudah and to Ierusalem: for Ieroboam and his sonnes had cast them out from ministring in the Priestes office vnto the Lorde."
14,11,15,"And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the"

14,11,22,"And Rehoboam made"

17,2,15,"Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women,"

17,3,3,"Then the Kings seruants which were at the Kings gate, said vnto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the Kings commandement?"
17,3,4,"Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they"

17,3,6,"Now he thought it too litle to lay hands onely on Mordecai: & because they had shewed him the people of Mordecai, Haman sought to destroy all the Iewes, that were throughout the whole kingdome of Ahashuerosh, euen the people of Mordecai."
17,3,7,"In the first month, that [is], the month"

17,3,10,"Then the King tooke his ring from his hand & gaue it vnto Haman the sonne of Hammedatha the Agagite the Iewes aduersarie."
17,3,11,"And the King sayde vnto Haman, Let the siluer be thine, and the people to doe with them as it pleaseth thee."
17,3,12,"Then were the Kings scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first moneth, and there was written (according to all that Haman commaunded) vnto the Kings officers, and to the captaines that were ouer euery prouince, and to the rulers of euery people, and to euery prouince, according to the writing thereof, and to euery people according to their language: in the name of King Ahashuerosh was it written, and sealed with the Kings ring."
17,3,13,"And the letters were sent by postes into all the Kings prouinces, to roote out, to kill and to destroy all the Iewes, both yong & olde, children and women, in one day vpon the thirteenth day of the twelft moneth, (which is the moneth Adar) and to spoyle them as a pray. {\cf2 (13:1) The copie of the letters was this, The great King Artaxerxes writeth these thinges to the princes and gouernours that are vnder him from India vnto Ethiopia in an hundreth and seuen and twentie prouinces. (13:2) When I was made Lord ouer many people, and had subdued the whole earth vnto my dominion, I would not exalt my selfe by the reason of my power, but purposed with equitie alway and gentlenesse to gouerne my subiects, and wholy to set them in a peaceable life, and thereby to bring my kingdome vnto tranquilitie, that men might safely goe thorow on euery side, and to renewe peace againe, which all men desire. (13:3) Now when I asked my counsellers how these things might be brought to passe, one that was conuersant with vs, of excellent wisdome, and constant in good wil, and shewed him selfe to be of sure fidelitie, which had the second place in the kingdome, euen Aman, (13:4) Declared vnto vs, that in all nations there was scattered abroad a rebellious people, that had lawes contrary to all people, and haue alway despised the commandements of Kings, and so that this generall empire, that we haue begunne, cannot be gouerned without offence. (13:5) Seeing nowe wee perceiue, that this people alone are altogether contrary vnto euery man, vsing strange and other maner of lawes, and hauing an euill opinion of our doings, and goe about to stablish wicked matters, that our kingdome should not come to good estate, (13:6) Therefore haue we comaunded, that all they that are appointed in writing vnto you by Aman (which is ordeined ouer ye affaires, & is as our second father) shall all with their wiues and children be destroyed & rooted out with ye sword of their enemies without all mercy, and that none be spared the fourtenth day of the twelfth moneth Adar of this yeere, (13:7) That they which of olde, and nowe also haue euer bene rebellious, may in one day with violence be thrust downe into the hell, to the intent that after this time our affaires may bee without troubles, and well gouerned in all pointes.}"
17,3,14,"The contents of the writing was, that there shoulde be giuen a commandement in all prouinces, and published vnto all people, that they should be ready against the same day."
17,3,15,"The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the"
17,4,1,"Now when Mordecai perceiued all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackecloth and ashes, and went out into the middes of the citie, and cryed with a great crye, and a bitter."
17,4,2,"And came even before the king's"
17,4,3,"And in euery prouince, and place, whither the Kings charge and his commission came, there was great sorowe among the Iewes, and fasting, and weeping and mourning, and many laye in sackecloth and in ashes."
17,4,4,"Then Esters maydes and her eunuches came and tolde it her: therefore the Queene was very heauie, and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackecloth from him, but he receiued it not."
17,4,5,"Then called Ester Hatach one of the Kings eunuches, whom he had appointed to serue her, and gaue him a commandement vnto Mordecai, to knowe what it was, and why it was."
17,4,6,"So Hatach went foorth to Mordecai vnto the streete of the citie, which was before the Kings gate."
17,4,7,"And Mordecai tolde him of all that which had come vnto him, and of the summe of the siluer that Haman had promised to pay vnto the Kings treasures, because of the Iewes, for to destroy them."
17,4,8,"Also he gaue him the copy of the writing and commission that was giuen at Shushan, to destroy them, that he might shewe it vnto Ester and declare it vnto her, and to charge her that she should goe in to the King, and make petition and supplication before him for her people."
17,4,9,"So when Hatach came, he told Ester the wordes of Mordecai."
17,4,10,"Then Ester sayde vnto Hatach, and commaunded him to say vnto Mordecai,"
17,4,11,"All the Kings seruants and the people of the Kings prouinces doe knowe, that whosoeuer, man or woman, that commeth to the King into the inner court, which is not called, there is a law of his, that he shall dye, except him to whom the King holdeth out the golden rodde, that he may liue. Now I haue not bene called to come vnto the King these thirtie dayes."
17,4,12,"And they certified Mordecai of Esters wordes."
17,4,13,"And Mordecai saide, that they should answere Ester thus, Thinke not with thy selfe that thou shalt escape in the Kings house, more then all the Iewes."
17,4,14,"For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, [then] shall there enlargement and deliverance"
17,4,15,"Then Ester commanded to answere Mordecai,"
17,4,16,"Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which [is] not according to the law: and if I perish,"
17,4,17,"So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Ester had commaunded him. {\cf2 (13:8) Then Mardocheus thought vpon all ye workes and of the Lord, and made his prayer vnto him, (13:9) Saying, O Lord, Lord, the King Almighty (for all things are in thy power) & if thou hast appointed to saue Israel, there is no man that can withstand thee. (13:10) For thou hast made heauen and earth, and all the wonderous things vnder the heauen. (13:11) Thou art Lorde of all thinges, and there is no man that can resist thee, which art the Lord. (13:12) Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest, Lord, that it was neither of malice, nor presumption, nor for any desire of glory, that I did this, and not bowe downe to proude Aman. (13:13) For I woulde haue bene content with good will for the saluation of Israel, to haue kist the sole of his feete. (13:14) But I did it, because I would not preferre the honour of a man aboue the glory of God, & would not worship any but onely thee, my Lorde, and this haue I not done of pride. (13:15) And therefore, O Lord God and King, haue mercy vpon thy people: for they imagine how they may bring vs to naught, yea, they would destroy the inheritance, that hath bin thine from the beginning. (13:16) Despise not the portion, which thou hast deliuered out of Egypt for thine owne selfe. (13:17) Heare my prayer, and bee mercifull vnto thy portion: turne our sorow into ioy, that we may liue, O Lord, and praise thy Name: shut not the mouthes of them that praise thee. (13:18) All Israel in like maner cried most earnestly vnto the Lord, because that death was before their eyes. \par (14:1) Qveene Esther also, being in danger of death, resorted vnto the Lord, (14:2) And layd away her glorious apparell, and put on the garments of sighing, and mourning. In the stead of precious oyntment, she scattered ashes, and dongue vpon her head: and she humbled her body greatly with fasting, and all the places of her ioy filled she with the heare that she pluckt off. (14:3) And she prayed vnto the Lord God of Israel, saying, O my Lorde, thou onely art our King: helpe me desolate woman, which haue no helper but thee. (14:4) For my danger is at hand. (14:5) From my youth vp I haue heard in the kinred of my father, that thou, O Lord, tookest Israel from among all people, and our fathers from their predecessours for a perpetuall inheritance, and thou hast performed that which thou didest promise them. (14:6) Now Lord, we haue sinned before thee: therefore hast thou giuen vs into ye hands of our enemies. (14:7) Because we worshipped their gods, O Lorde, thou art righteous. (14:8) Neuerthelesse, it satisfieth them not, that we are in bitter captiuitie, but they haue stroken hands with their idoles, (14:9) That they wil abolish the thing that thou with thy mouth hast ordeined, & destroy thine inheritace, to shut vp the mouth of them that praise thee, and to quench the glory of thy Temple, and of thine altar, (14:10) And to open the mouths of the heathen, that they may praise the power of the idoles, and to magnifie a fleshly King for euer. (14:11) O Lord, giue not thy scepter vnto them that be nothing, lest they laugh vs to scorne in our miserie: but turne their deuise vpon theselues, and make him an example, that hath begunne the same against vs. (14:12) Thinke vpon vs, O Lord, and shewe thy selfe vnto vs in the time of our distresse, and strengthen me, O King of gods, and Lord of all power. (14:13) Giue me an eloquent speach in my mouth before the Lion: turne his heart to hate our enemie, to destroy him, and all such as consent vnto him. (14:14) But deliuer vs with thine hand, and helpe me that am solitary, which haue no defence but onely thee. (14:15) Thou knowest all things, O Lord: thou knowest, that I hate the glory of the vnrighteous, and that I abhorre the bed of the vncircumcised, and of all the heathen. (14:16) Thou knowest my necessitie: for I hate this token of my preeminence, which I beare vpon mine head, what time as I must shewe my selfe, and that I abhorre it as a menstruous cloth, and that I weare it not when I am alone by my selfe, (14:17) And that I thine handmayde haue not eaten at Amans table, and that I haue had no pleasure in the Kings feast, nor drunke the wine of the drinke offerings, (14:18) And that I thine handmayde haue no ioye since the day that I was brought hither, vntill this day, but in thee, O Lord God of Abraham. (14:19) O thou mighty God aboue al, heare the voyce of them, that haue none other hope, & deliuer vs out of the hand of ye wicked, & deliuer me out of my feare.}"

17,5,10,"Neuerthelesse Haman refrayned himselfe: and when he came home, he sent, and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife."

17,6,2,"Then it was found written that Mordecai had tolde of Bigtana, and Teresh two of the Kings eunuches, keepers of the dore, who sought to lay hands on the King Ahashuerosh."
17,6,3,"And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai"

17,6,6,"And when Haman came in, the King saide vnto him, What shalbe done vnto ye man, whom the King will honour? Then Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the King do honour more then to me?"
17,6,7,"And Haman answered the King, The man whome the King would honour,"
17,6,8,"Let the royal apparel be brought which the king [useth] to wear, and the"

17,6,10,"Then the King said to Haman, Make haste, take the rayment and the horse as thou hast said, and doe so vnto Mordecai the Iewe, that sitteth at the Kings gate: let nothing fayle of all that thou hast spoken."
17,6,11,"So Haman tooke the rayment and the horse, and arayed Mordecai, and brought him on horse backe thorowe the streete of the citie, and proclaymed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the King will honour."
17,6,12,"And Mordecai came againe to the Kings gate, but Haman hasted home mourning and his head couered."
17,6,13,"And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every [thing] that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai [be] of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him,"
17,6,14,"And while they were yet talking with him, came the Kings eunuches & hasted to bring Haman vnto the banket that Ester had prepared."
17,7,1,"So the King and Haman came to banket with the Queene Ester."

17,8,6,"For how can I suffer and see the euil, that shall come vnto my people? Or howe can I suffer and see the destruction of my kinred?"
17,8,7,"And the King Ahashuerosh sayde vnto the Queene Ester, & to Mordecai the Iewe, Behold, I haue giuen Ester the house of Haman, whome they haue hanged vpon the tree, because he layd hand vpon the Iewes."

17,9,15,"So the Iewes that were in Shushan, assembled themselues vpon the fourteenth day of the moneth Adar, & slew three hundreth men in Shushan, but on the spoyle they layd not their hand."

26,36,16,"Moreouer the word of the Lorde came vnto me, saying,"
26,36,17,"Sonne of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their owne lande, they defiled it by their owne wayes, & by their deedes: their way was before me as the filthinesse of the menstruous."
26,36,18,"Wherfore I powred my wrath vpon them, for the blood that they had shed in the land, and for their idoles, wherewith they had polluted it."
26,36,19,"And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries for according to their wayes, and according to their deedes, I iudged them."
26,36,20,"And when they entred vnto the heathen, whither they went, they polluted mine holy Name, when they sayd of them, These are the people of the Lord, and are gone out of his land."
26,36,21,"But I had pity for my holy"

26,36,32,"Be it knowen vnto you that I do not this for your sakes, sayth the Lord God: therefore, O ye house of Israel, be ashamed, and confounded for your owne wayes."
26,36,33,"Thus sayth the Lord God, What time as I shall haue clensed you from all your iniquities, I will cause you to dwel in the cities, & the desolate places shalbe builded."
26,36,34,"And the desolate land shalbe tilled, whereas it lay waste in the sight of all that passed by."
26,36,35,"For they sayd, This waste land was like the garden of Eden, and these waste & desolate and ruinous cities were strong, and were inhabited."
26,36,36,"Then the nations that are left around you shall"

26,37,1,"The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which [was] full of"

26,37,10,"So I prophecied as hee had commaunded me: and the breath came into them, and they liued, and stood vp vpon their feete, an exceeding great armie."
26,37,11,"Then he sayd vnto me, Sonne of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is gone, and we are cleane cut off."
26,37,12,"Therefore prophecie, and say vnto them, Thus saith the Lorde God, Beholde, my people, I will open your graues, and cause you to come vp out of your sepulchres, and bring you into the lande of Israel,"
26,37,13,"And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD,"

26,41,21,"The postes of the Temple were squared, & thus to looke vnto was the similitude and forme of the Sanctuarie."
26,41,22,"The altar of wood was three cubites hie, and the length thereof two cubites, and the corners thereof and the length thereof and the sides thereof were of wood; he sayd vnto me, This is the table that shalbe before the Lord."
26,41,23,"And the Temple and the Sanctuarie had two doores."
26,41,24,"And the doores had two wickets, euen two turning wickets, two wickets for one doore, and two wickets for another doore."
26,41,25,"And vpon the doores of the Temple there were made Cherubims and palmetrees, like as was made vpon the walles, and there were thicke plankes vpon the forefront of the porch without."
26,41,26,"And there were narow windowes & palme trees on the one side, and on the other side, by the sides of the porch, and vpon ye sides of the house, and thicke plankes."
26,42,1,"Then brought hee me into the vtter court by the way towarde the North, and he brought me into the chamber that was ouer against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the North."
26,42,2,"Before ye length of an hundreth cubites, was the North doore, and it was fiftie cubites broad."
26,42,3,"Ouer against the twentie cubites which were for the inner court, and ouer against the pauement, which was for the vtter court, was chamber against chamber in three rowes."
26,42,4,"And before the chambers was a gallery of ten cubites wide, and within was a way of one cubite, and their doores towarde the North."
26,42,5,"Nowe the chambers aboue were narower: for those chambers seemed to eate vp these, to wit, the lower, and those that were in the middes of the building."
26,42,6,"For they were in three rowes, but had not pillars as the pillars of the court: therefore there was a difference from them beneath and from the middlemost, euen from the ground."
26,42,7,"And the wall that was without ouer against the chambers, toward the vtter court on the forefront of the chambers, was fiftie cubites long."
26,42,8,"For the length of the chambers that were in the vtter court, was fiftie cubites: and loe, before the Temple were an hundreth cubites."
26,42,9,"And vnder these chambers was the entrie, on the East side, as one goeth into them from the outward court."
26,42,10,"The chambers were in the thicknesse of the wall of the court towarde the East, ouer against the separate place, and ouer against the building."
26,42,11,"And the way before them was after ye maner of the chambers, which were toward ye North, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their entries were like, both according to their facions, and according to their doores."
26,42,12,"And according to ye doores of ye chambers that were towarde the South, was a doore in the corner of the way, euen the way directly before the wall toward the East, as one entreth."
26,42,13,"The said he vnto me, The North chambers and ye South chambers which are before ye separate place, they be holy chambers, wherein the Priests that approch vnto ye Lord, shal eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meate offering, and the sinne offering, and the trespasse offring: for the place is holy."
26,42,14,"When the Priestes enter therein, they shall not go out of the holy place into the vtter court, but there they shall lay their garmentes wherein they minister: for they are holy, and shall put on other garmentes, and so shall approch to those things, which are for the people."
26,42,15,"Nowe when he had made an ende of measuring the inner house, he brought mee forth toward the gate whose prospect is towarde the East, and measured it round about."
26,42,16,"He measured the East side with the measuring rod, fiue hundreth reedes, euen with the measuring reede round about."
26,42,17,"He measured also the Northside, fiue hundreth reedes, euen with the measuring reede rounde about."
26,42,18,"And he measured the South side fiue hundreth reedes with the measuring reede."
26,42,19,"He turned about also to the West side, and measured fiue hundreth reedes with the measuring reede."
26,42,20,"He measured it by the foure sides: it had a wall round about, fiue hundreth reedes long, and fiue hundreth broade to make a separation betweene the Sanctuarie, and the prophane place."
26,43,1,"Afterwarde he brought me to the gate, euen the gate that turneth towarde the East."
26,43,2,"And beholde, the glorie of the God of Israel came from out of the East, whose voyce was like a noyse of great waters, and the earth was made light with his glorie."
26,43,3,"And [it was] according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, [even] according to the vision that I saw"
26,43,4,"And the"
26,43,5,"So the Spirite tooke me vp and brought me into the inner court, and beholde, the glorie of the Lorde filled the house."
26,43,6,"And I heard one speaking vnto me out of the house: and there stoode a man by me,"
26,43,7,"And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more"
26,43,8,"Albeit they set their thresholdes by my thresholdes, and their postes by my postes (for there was but a wall betweene me and them) yet haue they defiled mine holy Name with their abominations, that they haue committed: wherfore I haue consumed them in my wrath."
26,43,9,"Now therefore let them put away their fornication, and the carkeises of their Kings farre from me, and I will dwell among them for euer."
26,43,10,"Thou sonne of man, shew this House to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their wickednes, & let them measure ye paterne."
26,43,11,"And if they be ashamed of all that they haue done, shew them the forme of the House, & ye paterne thereof, & the going out thereof, & the coming in thereof, & the whole fashion thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the figures thereof, and all the lawes thereof: & write it in their sight, that they may keepe the whole fashio thereof, & all the ordinances thereof, & do them."
26,43,12,"This is the description of the house, It shalbe vpon the toppe of the mount: all the limites thereof round about shalbe most holy. Beholde, this is the description of the house."
26,43,13,"And these are the measures of the Altar, after the cubites, the cubite is a cubite, & an had breadth, euen the bottome shalbe a cubite, and the breadth a cubite, and the border thereof by the edge thereof rounde about shalbe a spanne: and this shalbe the height of the altar."
26,43,14,"And from the bottome which toucheth the ground to the lower piece shalbe two cubites: and the breadth one cubite, and from the litle piece to the great piece shalbe foure cubites, and the breadth one cubite."
26,43,15,"So the altar shalbe foure cubites, and from the altar vpward shalbe foure hornes."
26,43,16,"And the altar shalbe twelue cubites long, and twelue broade, and fouresquare in the foure corners thereof."
26,43,17,"And ye frame shalbe foureteene cubites log, and fourteene broade in the fouresquare corners thereof, & the border about it shalbe halfe a cubite, & the bottome therof shalbe a cubite about, & the steps thereof shalbe turned towarde ye East."
26,43,18,"And he said vnto me, Sone of man, thus saith ye Lord God, These are ye ordinaces of ye altar in the day when they shall make it to offer the burnt offring theron, & to sprinkle blood theron."
26,43,19,"And thou shalt giue to the Priestes, and to the Leuites, that be of the seede of Zadok, which approch vnto me, to minister vnto me, saith the Lord God, a yong bullocke for a sinne offring."
26,43,20,"And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, & put it on the foure hornes of it, & on the foure corners of the frame, and vpon the border round about: thus shalt thou clense it, and reconcile it."
26,43,21,"Thou shalt take the bullocke also of the sinne offring, and burne it in the appointed place of the house without the Sanctuarie."
26,43,22,"But the second day thou shalt offer an hee goat wtout blemish for a sinne offring, & they shal clense ye altar, as they did clense it with the bullocke."
26,43,23,"When thou hast made an ende of clensing it, thou shalt offer a yong bullocke without blemish, & a ram out of the flocke without blemish."
26,43,24,"And thou shalt offer them before ye Lord, and the Priestes shall cast salt vpon them, & they shall offer them for a burnt offring vnto ye Lord."
26,43,25,"Seuen dayes shalt thou prepare euery day an hee goate for a sinne offring: they shall also prepare a yong bullocke and a ramme out of the flocke, without blemish."
26,43,26,"Thus shall they seuen dayes purifie the altar, and clense it, and consecrate it."
26,43,27,"And when these dayes are expired, vpon the eight day and so forth, the Priests shall make your burnt offrings vpon the altar, & your peace offrings, & I will accept you, saith the Lord God."
26,44,1,"Then he brought me towarde the gate of the outwarde Sanctuarie, which turneth towarde the East, and it was shut."
26,44,2,"Then said the LORD to me; This gate shall be"
26,44,3,"It appertaineth to the Prince: the Prince himselfe shall sit in it to eate bread before the Lorde: he shall enter by the way of the porche of that gate, & shal go out by the way of the same."
26,44,4,"Then brought he mee toward the North gate before the House: and when I looked, beholde, the glorie of the Lorde filled the house of the Lorde, and I fell vpon my face."
26,44,5,"And the Lord sayd vnto me, Sonne of man, marke wel, & behold with thine eyes, & heare with thine eares, all that I say vnto thee, concerning al the ordinances of the house of the Lord, & al the lawes thereof, & marke well the entring in of the house with euery going forth of the Sanctuarie,"
26,44,6,"And thou shalt say to the rebellious, euen to ye house of Israel, Thus saith ye Lord God, O house of Israel, ye haue ynough of al your abominatios,"
26,44,7,"In that ye have brought [into my sanctuary]"
26,44,8,"And ye have not kept the"
26,44,9,"Thus saieth the Lord God, No stranger vncircumcised in heart, nor vncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my Sanctuarie, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel,"
26,44,10,"And the"
26,44,11,"And they shall serue in my Sanctuarie, and keepe the gates of the House, and minister in the House: they shall slay the burnt offring and the sacrifice for the people: and they shall stand before them to serue them."
26,44,12,"Because they serued before their idoles, & caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquitie, therfore haue I lift vp mine had against the, saith the Lord God, and they shal beare their iniquity,"
26,44,13,"And they shal not come neere vnto me to do ye office of ye Priest vnto me, neyther shal they come neere vnto any of mine holy things in the most holy place, but they shall beare their shame & their abominatios, which they haue comitted."
26,44,14,"And I will make them keepers of ye watch of the House, for all the seruice thereof, and for all that shalbe done therein."
26,44,15,"But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that"
26,44,16,"They shall enter into my Sanctuarie, and shall come neere to my table, to serue me, and they shall keepe my charge."
26,44,17,"And whe they shal enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments, & no wool shall come vpon the while they serue in ye gates of the inner court, & within."
26,44,18,"They shall haue linnen bonets vpon their heades, and shall haue linnen breeches vpon their loynes: they shall not girde them selues in the sweating places."
26,44,19,"But when they goe foorth into the vtter court, euen to the vtter court to the people, they shall put off their garments, wherein they ministred, and lay them in the holy chambers, & they shall put on other garments: for they shall not sanctifie the people with their garments."
26,44,20,"Neither shall they"
26,44,21,"Neither shall any Priest drinke wine when they enter into the inner court."
26,44,22,"Neither shall they take for their wiues a widowe, or her that is diuorced: but they shall take maidens of the seede of the house of Israel, or a widow that hath bene the widow of a Priest."
26,44,23,"And they shal teach my people the differece betweene the holy and prophane, & cause them to discerne betweene the vncleane & the cleane."
26,44,24,"And in controuersie they shall stande to iudge, and they shall iudge it according to my iudgements: and they shall keepe my lawes and my statutes in all mine assemblies, and they shall sanctifie my Sabbaths."
26,44,25,"And they shall come near no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may"
26,44,26,"And when he is clensed, they shall reckon vnto him seuen dayes."
26,44,27,"And when he goeth into ye Sanctuarie vnto the inner court to minister in the Sanctuarie, he shall offer his sinne offring, saith ye Lord God."
26,44,28,"And the Priesthood shall bee their inheritance, yea, I am their inheritance: therefore shall ye giue them no possessio in Israel, for I am their possession."
26,44,29,"They shall eate the meat offring, and the sinne offring, and the trespas offring, and euery dedicate thing in Israel shal be theirs."
26,44,30,"And all the first of all the first borne, & euery oblation, euen all of euery sort of your oblations shall be the Priestes. Ye shal also giue vnto the Priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house."
26,44,31,"The Priests shal not eate of any thing, that is dead, or torne, whether it be foule or beast."
26,45,1,"Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation to the LORD, an"
26,45,2,"Of this there shalbe for the Sanctuarie fiue hundreth in length with fiue hundreth in breadth, all square round about, and fiftie cubites rounde about for the suburbes thereof."
26,45,3,"And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of fiue and twentie thousande, and the breadth of tenne thousande: and in it shalbe the Sanctuarie, and the most holy place."
26,45,4,"The holy portion of the lande shalbe the Priests, which minister in the Sanctuarie, which came neere to serue the Lorde: and it shalbe a place for their houses, and an holy place for the Sanctuarie."
26,45,5,"And in the fiue and twentie thousande of length, and the ten thousand of breadth shall the Leuites that minister in the house, haue their possession for twentie chambers."
26,45,6,"Also ye shall appoynt the possession of the citie, fiue thousand broad, and fiue and twentie thousand log ouer against the oblation of ye holy portion: it shalbe for the whole house of Israel."
26,45,7,"And a portion shalbe for the prince on ye one side, and on that side of the oblation of the holy portion, & of the possession of the citie, euen before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the citie from the West corner Westward, and from the East corner Eastward, and the length shalbe by one of the portions fro the West border vnto the East border."
26,45,8,"In this lande shalbe his possession in Israel: and my princes shal no more oppresse my people, and the rest of the land shall they giue to ye house of Israel, according to their tribes."
26,45,9,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it"
26,45,10,"Ye shall have just balances, and a just"
26,45,11,"The Ephah and the Bath shalbe equall: a Bath shall conteyne the tenth part of an Homer, and an Ephah the tenth part of an Homer: the equalitie thereof shalbe after the Homer."
26,45,12,"And the shekel [shall be] twenty gerahs: twenty shekels,"
26,45,13,"This is the oblation that ye shall offer, ye sixt part of an Ephah of an Homer of wheat, and ye shall giue the sixt part of an Ephah of an Homer of barley."
26,45,14,"Concerning ye ordinance of the oyle, euen of the Bath of oyle, ye shall offer the tenth part of a Bath out of ye Cor (ten Baths are an Homer: for ten Baths fill an Homer)"
26,45,15,"And one lambe of two hundreth sheepe out of ye fat pastures of Israel for a meat offring, and for a burnt offring and for peace offrings, to make reconciliation for them, sayth the Lorde God."
26,45,16,"All the people of the lande shall giue this oblation for the prince in Israel."
26,45,17,"And it shalbe ye princes part to giue burnt offrings, and meat offrings, and drinke offrings in the solemne feasts and in the newe moones, & in the Sabbaths, and in all the hie feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sinne offring, and the meat offring, and the burnt offring, and the peace offrings to make reconciliation for the house of Israel."
26,45,18,"Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first [month], in the first [day] of the"

26,45,20,"And so shalt thou doe the seuenth day of the moneth, for euery one that hath erred and for him that is deceiued: so shall you reconcile the house."
26,45,21,"In the first moneth in the foureteenth day of the moneth, ye shal haue the Passeouer, a feast of seuen dayes, & ye shal eate vnleauened bread."
26,45,22,"And vpon that day, shal the prince prepare for him selfe, and for all the people of the lande, a bullocke for a sinne offring."
26,45,23,"And in the seuen dayes of the feast he shal make a burnt offring to the Lorde, euen of seuen bullockes, and seuen rammes without blemish dayly for seuen dayes, and an hee goate dayly for a sinne offring."
26,45,24,"And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and an"
26,45,25,"In the seuenth moneth, in the fifteenth day of the moneth, shal he do the like in the feast for seuen dayes, according to the sinne offring, according to the burnt offring, and according to the meate offring, and according to the oyle."
26,46,1,"Thus sayth the Lord God, The gate of the inner court, that turneth toward the East, shall be shut the sixe working dayes: but on the Sabbath it shalbe opened, and in the day of the newe moone it shalbe opened."
26,46,2,"And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stande by the post of the gate, and the Priests shal make his burnt offring, and his peace offrings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: after, he shall go foorth, but the gate shall not be shut till the euening."
26,46,3,"Likewise the people of the lande shall worshippe at the entrie of this gate before the Lorde on the Sabbaths, and in the newe moones."
26,46,4,"And the burnt offring that the prince shall offer vnto the Lorde on the Sabbath day, shalbe sixe lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish."
26,46,5,"And the meat offering [shall be] an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs"
26,46,6,"And in the day of the newe moone it shalbee a yong bullocke without blemish, and sixe lambes and a ram: they shalbe without blemish."
26,46,7,"And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs"
26,46,8,"And when the prince shall enter, hee shall goe in by the way of the porche of that gate, and hee shall go foorth by the way thereof."
26,46,9,"But when the people of the land shal come before the Lord in the solemne feastes, hee that entreth in by the way of the North gate to worship, shall goe out by the way of the South gate: & he that entreth by the way of the South gate, shall goe foorth by the way of the North gate: hee shall not returne by the way of the gate whereby hee came in, but they shall goe forth ouer against it."
26,46,10,"And the prince shall be in the middes of them: hee shall go in when they goe in, & when they goe forth, they shal goe forth together."
26,46,11,"And in the feastes, and in the solemnities the meat offring shalbe an Ephah to a bullocke, and an Ephah to a ram, and to the lambes, the gift of his hand, and an Hin of oyle to an Ephah."
26,46,12,"Nowe when the prince shall make a free burnt offring or peace offrings freely vnto the Lord, one shall then open him the gate, that turneth towarde the East, and hee shall make his burnt offring and his peace offrings, as he did on the Sabbath day: after, hee shall goe foorth, and when he is gone forth, one shall shut the gate."
26,46,13,"Thou shalt dayly make a burnt offring vnto the Lord of a lambe of one yere without blemish: thou shalt doe it euery morning."
26,46,14,"And thou shalt prepare a meate offring for it euery morning, the sixt part of an Ephah, and the thirde part of an Hin of oyle, to mingle with the fine flowre: this meate offring shalbe continually by a perpetuall ordinance vnto the Lorde."
26,46,15,"Thus shall they prepare the lambe, and the meate offring and the oyle euery morning, for a continual burnt offring."
26,46,16,"Thus saith the Lorde God, If the prince giue a gift of his inheritance vnto any of his sonnes, it shalbe his sonnes, and it shall bee their possession by inheritance."
26,46,17,"But if he shall give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the"

26,46,19,"After, he brought me through the entrie, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the Priestes, which stoode towarde the North: and beholde, there was a place at the West side of them."
26,46,20,"Then said he to me, This [is] the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear [them] not out into the outer court,"
26,46,21,"Then he brought me foorth into the vtter court, and caused me to goe by the foure corners of the court: and beholde, in euery corner of the court, there was a court."
26,46,22,"In the foure corners of the court there were courts ioyned of fourty cubits long, & thirty broad: these foure corners were of one measure."
26,46,23,"And there went a wall about them, euen about those foure, and kitchins were made vnder the walles rounde about."
26,46,24,"Then said he vnto me, This is the kitchin where the ministers of the house shall seethe the sacrifice of the people."
26,47,1,"Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold,"
26,47,2,"Then brought he me out toward the North gate, and led me about by the way without vnto the vtter gate, by the way that turneth Eastward: & behold, there came forth waters on ye right side"
26,47,3,"And when the man that had the line in his hand, went foorth Eastward, he measured a thousand cubites, and he brought me through the waters: the waters were to the ancles."
26,47,4,"Againe he measured a thousande, and brought me through the waters: the waters were to the knees: againe he measured a thousand, & brought me through: ye waters were to ye loynes."
26,47,5,"Afterward he measured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass over: for the waters had risen, waters to swim in, a"
26,47,6,"And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, hast thou seene this? Then he brought me, and caused me to returne to the brinke of the riuer."
26,47,7,"Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river [were] very many"

26,47,13,"Thus saith the Lorde God, This shall be the border, whereby ye shall inherite the lande according to the twelue tribes of Israel: Ioseph shall haue two portions."
26,47,14,"And ye shal inherite it, one as wel as another: concerning the which I lift vp mine hand to giue it vnto your fathers, and this lande shall fall vnto you for inheritance."
26,47,15,"And this [shall be] the border"

26,47,17,"And the border from the sea shalbe Hazar, Enan, & the border of Damascus, and the residue of the North, Northwarde, and the border of Hamath: so shalbe the North part."
26,47,18,"But the East side shall ye measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the lande of Israel by Iorden, and from the border vnto the East sea: and so shalbe the East part."
26,47,19,"And the Southside shalbe towarde Teman from Tamar to the waters of Meriboth in Kadesh, and the riuer to the maine sea: so shalbe the South part towarde Teman."
26,47,20,"The West parte also shalbe the great sea from the border, till a man come ouer against Hamath: this shalbe the West part."
26,47,21,"So shall ye deuide this lande vnto you, according to the tribes of Israel."
26,47,22,"And it shall come to pass, [that] ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be to you as born in the country among the children of Israel;"
26,47,23,"And in what tribe the stranger dwelleth, there shall ye giue him his inheritance, saith the Lorde God."

26,48,8,"And by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side,"
26,48,9,"The oblation that ye shall offer vnto the Lord, shalbe of fiue and twentie thousande long, and of ten thousand the breadth."
26,48,10,"And for them, euen for the Priestes shalbe this holy oblation, towarde the North fiue and twentie thousande long, and towarde the West, ten thousande broade, and towarde the East ten thousand broad, and towarde the South fiue and twentie thousand long, and the Sanctuarie of the Lorde shalbe in the middes thereof."

27,2,10,"Then the Caldeans answered before the King, and sayde, There is no man vpon earth that can declare the Kings matter: yea, there is neither king nor prince nor lorde that asked such things at an inchanter or astrologian or Caldean."

27,2,34,"Thou beheldest it til a stone was cut without hands, which smote the image vpon his feete, that were of yron and clay, and brake them to pieces."
27,2,35,"Then was the yron, the clay, the brasse, the siluer and the golde broken all together, and became like the chaffe of the sommer floures, and the winde caryed them away, that no place was founde for them: and the stone that smote the image, became a great mountaine, and filled the whole earth."
27,2,36,"This is the dreame, and we will declare before the King the interpretation thereof."

27,3,8,"By reason whereof at that same time came men of the Caldeans, and grieuously accused the Iewes."
27,3,9,"For they spake and said to the King Nebuchad-nezzar, O King, liue for euer."
27,3,10,"Thou, O King, hast made a decree, that euery man that shall heare the sounde of the cornet, trumpet, harpe, sackebut, psalterie, and dulcimer, and all instruments of musike, shall fall downe and worship the golden image,"

27,3,12,"There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon,"
27,3,13,"Then Nebuchad-nezzar in his anger and wrath commaunded that they should bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: so these men were brought before the King."
27,3,14,"And Nebuchad-nezzar spake, and said vnto them, What disorder? Will not you, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego serue my god, nor worship the golden image, that I haue set vp?"

27,3,19,"Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: [therefore] he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven"
27,3,20,"And hee charged the most valiant men of warre that were in his armie, to binde Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the hote fierie fornace."

27,3,22,"Therefore, because the Kings commaundement was straite, that the fornace should be exceeding hote, the flame of the fire slew those men that brought foorth Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego."
27,3,23,"And these three men Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego fell downe bound into the middes of the hote fierie fornace. \par {\cf2 (3:24) And they walked in the middes of the flame, praising God, & magnified the Lord. (3:25) Then Azarias stoode vp, & praied on this maner, and opening his mouth in ye mids of the fire, saide, (3:26) Blessed be thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy Name is worthie to bee praised and honoured for euermore. (3:27) For thou art righteous in all the things, that thou hast done vnto vs, and all thy works are true, and thy waies are right, and all thy iudgementes certeine. (3:28) In all the things that thou hast brought vpon vs, and vpon Ierusalem, the holy citie of our fathers, thou hast executed true iudgementes: for by right and equitie hast thou brought all these things vpon vs, because of our sinnes. (3:29) For we haue sinned and done wickedly, departing from thee: in all things haue we trespassed, (3:30) And not obeied thy commaundements, nor kept them, neither done as thou haddest commanded vs, that we might prosper. (3:31) Wherefore in all that thou hast broughtvpon vs, and in euery thing that thou hast done to vs, thou hast done them in true iudgement: (3:32) As in deliuering vs into the handes of our wicked enemies, and most hatefull traitours, and to an vnrighteous King, and the most wicked in all the worlde. (3:33) And nowe we may not open our mouthes: we are become a shame and reproofe vnto thy seruants, and to them that worship thee. (3:34) Yet for thy names sake, we beseech thee, giue vs not vp for euer, neither breake thy couenant, (3:35) Neither take away thy mercie from vs, for thy beloued Abrahams sake, and for thy seruant Isaacs sake, and for thine holy Israels sake, (3:36) To whome thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiplie their seed as ye starres of heauen, & as the sand, that is vpon the sea shore. (3:37) For we, O Lorde, are become lesse then any nation, and be kept vnder this day in all the world, because of our sinnes: (3:38) So that now we haue neither prince, nor prophet, nor gouernour, nor burnt offering, nor sacrifice, nor oblation, nor incense, nor place to offer ye first fruits before thee, that we might finde mercie. (3:39) Neuerthelesse in a contrite heart, & an humble spirit, let vs be receiued. (3:40) As in the burnt offring of rams & bullocks, and as in ten thousand of fat lambes, so let our offring be in thy sight this daye, that it may please thee: for there is no confusion vnto them that put their trust in thee. (3:41) And now we follow thee with all our heart, and feare thee, and seeke thy face. (3:42) Put vs not to shame, but deale with vs after thy louing kindenesse, and according to the multitude of thy mercies. (3:43) Deliuer vs also by thy miracles, and giue thy Name the glory, O Lord, (3:44) That all they which doe thy seruantes euill, may be confounded: euen let them bee confounded by thy great force and power, and let their strength be broken, (3:45) That they may know, that thou only art the Lord God, and glorious ouer the whole worlde.

67,4,8,"{\cf2 Giue almes according to thy substace: if thou haue but a litle, be not afrayd to giue a litle almes.}"
67,4,9,"{\cf2 For thou layest vp a good store for thy selfe against the day of necessitie,}"
67,4,10,"{\cf2 Because that almes doeth deliuer fro death, and suffreth not to come into darkenesse.}"
67,4,11,"{\cf2 For almes is a good gifte before the most High to all them which vse it.}"
67,4,12,"{\cf2 Beware of all whoredome, my sonne, and chiefly take a wife of the seede of thy fathers, and take not a strange woman to wife, which is not of thy fathers stocke: for wee are the children of the Prophetes. Noe, Abraham, Isaac and Iacob are our fathers from the beginning. Remember my sonne, that they marryed wiues of their owne kinred, and were blessed in their children, and their seede shall inherite the lande.}"
67,4,13,"{\cf2 Now therefore, my sonne, loue thy brethren, & despise not in thine heart thy brethre, the sonnes and daughters of thy people, in not taking a wife of them: for in pride is destruction, & much trouble, and in fiercenes is scarcitie, and great pouertie: for fiercenes is the mother of famine.}"
67,4,14,"{\cf2 Let not the wages of any man, which hath wrought for thee, tary with thee, but giue him it out of hand: for if thou serue God, he wil also pay thee: be circumspect, my sonne, in all thinges that thou doest, & be wel instructed in all thy conuersation.}"
67,4,15,"{\cf2 Do that to no ma which thou hatest: drinke not wine to make thee drunken, neyther let drunkennesse go with thee in thy iourney.}"
67,4,16,"{\cf2 Giue of thy bread to the hungry, & of thy garments to them that are naked, and of all thine abundance giue almes, and let not thine eye be enuious, when thou giuest almes.}"
67,4,17,"{\cf2 Powre out thy bread on the buriall of the iust, but giue nothing to the wicked.}"
67,4,18,"{\cf2 Aske counsell alway of the wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable.}"
67,4,19,"{\cf2 Blesse thy Lord God alway, & desire of him that thy wayes may be made streight, and that all thy purposes and counsels may prosper: for euery nation hath not counsell: but the Lord giueth all good things, and he humbleth whome he wil, as he will: now therefore, my sonne, remember my commandements, neyther let them at any time be put out of thy minde.}"
67,4,20,"{\cf2 Furthermore I signifie this to thee, that I deliuered tenne talents to Gabael the sonne of Gabrias at Rages in Media.}"
67,4,21,"{\cf2 And feare not, my sonne, forasmuch as wee are made poore: for thou hast many things, if thou feare God, & flee from all sinne, and do that thing which is acceptable vnto him.}"
67,5,1,"{\cf2 Tobias then answered, and sayd, Father, I wil do all things which thou hast commanded me.}"
67,5,2,"{\cf2 But howe can I receiue the siluer, seeing I know him not?}"
67,5,3,"{\cf2 Then he gaue him the hand writing, & sayd vnto him, Seeke thee a man, which may goe with thee, whiles I yet liue, and I will giue him wages, & go and receiue the money.}"
67,5,4,"{\cf2 Therfore when he was gone to seeke a man, he found Raphael the Angel.}"
67,5,5,"{\cf2 But he knewe not, and sayd vnto him, May I goe with thee into the land of Media? and knowest thou those places well?}"
67,5,6,"{\cf2 To whom the Angel said, I wil go with thee: for I haue remained with our brother Gabael.}"
67,5,7,"{\cf2 Then Tobias sayd to him, Tarie for me, till I tell my father.}"
67,5,8,"{\cf2 Then he sayde vnto him, Goe, and tarie not: so he went in and sayde to his father, Beholde, I haue founde one, which will goe with me. Then he sayde, Call him vnto me, that I may knowe of what tribe he is, and whether he be faithfull to goe with thee.}"
67,5,9,"{\cf2 So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.}"
67,5,10,"{\cf2 Then Tobit sayde vnto him, Brother, shewe me of what tribe and familie thou art.}"
67,5,11,"{\cf2 To whom he said, Doest thou seeke a stocke or familie, or an hired man to goe with thy sonne? Then Tobit sayd vnto him, I would know, brother, thy kindred and thy name.}"
67,5,12,"{\cf2 Then he sayd, I am of the kinred of Azarias and Ananias the great, and of thy brethren.}"
67,5,13,"{\cf2 Then Tobit sayde, Thou art welcome, brother: be not now angry with me, because I haue enquired to knowe thy kinred, & thy familie: for thou art my brother of an honest & good stocke: for I know Ananias & Ionathas, sonnes of that great Samaias: for we went together to Ierusalem to worship, & offred the first borne, & the tenthes of the fruites, & they were not deceiued with the error of our brethren my brother, thou art of a great stocke.}"
67,5,14,"{\cf2 But tel me, What wages shal I giue thee? wilt thou a groate a day and things necessarie, as to mine owne sonne?}"
67,5,15,"{\cf2 Yea, moreouer if ye returne safe, I will adde some thing to the wages.}"
67,5,16,"{\cf2 So they agreed. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare thy selfe for the iourney, and goe you on Gods Name; when his sonne had prepared all things for the iourney, his father sayde, Goe thou with this man, and God which dwelleth in heauen, prosper your iourney, & the Angel of God keepe you companie. So they went forth both and departed, & the dogge of the yong man with them.}"
67,5,17,"{\cf2 But Anna his mother wept, & sayd to Tobit, Why hast thou sent away our sonne? is he not the staffe of our hand to minister vnto vs?}"
67,5,18,"{\cf2 Woulde to God wee had not layde money vpon money, but that it had bene cast away in respect of our sonne.}"
67,5,19,"{\cf2 For that which God hath giuen vs to liue with, doeth suffice vs.}"
67,5,20,"{\cf2 Then said Tobit, Be not carefull, my sister: he shal returne in safetie, and thine eyes shal see him.}"
67,5,21,"{\cf2 For the good Angel doeth keepe him company, and his iourney shalbe prosperous, and he shal returne safe.}"
67,5,22,"{\cf2 Then she made an ende of weeping.}"
67,6,1,"{\cf2 And as they went on their iourney, they came at night to the flood Tygris, and there abode.}"
67,6,2,"{\cf2 And when the yong man went to wash him selfe, a fish leaped out of the riuer, and would haue deuoured him.}"
67,6,3,"{\cf2 Then the Angel said vnto him, Take the fish; the yong man tooke ye fish, & drew it to land.}"
67,6,4,"{\cf2 To whome the Angel sayd, Cut the fish, and take the heart, and the liuer, and the gall, and put them vp surely.}"
67,6,5,"{\cf2 So the yong man did as the Angel commanded him: and when they had rosted the fishe, they ate it: then they both went on their way, till they came to Ecbatane.}"
67,6,6,"{\cf2 Then the yong man sayde to the Angel, Brother Azarias, what auaileth the heart, and the liuer, and the gall of the fish?}"
67,6,7,"{\cf2 And he sayd vnto him, Touching the heart, and the liuer, if a deuil or an euil spirit trouble any, we must make a perfume of this before the man or the woman, and he shalbe no more vexed.}"
67,6,8,"{\cf2 As for ye gall, anoynt a man that hath whitenes in his eyes, and he shalbe healed.}"
67,6,9,"{\cf2 And whe they were come neere to Rages,}"
67,6,10,"{\cf2 The Angel sayde to the yong man, Brother, to day we shall lodge with Raguel, who is thy cousin: he also hath one only daughter named Sarra: I will speake for her that she may be giue thee for a wife.}"
67,6,11,"{\cf2 For to thee doeth the right of her perteine, seeing thou alone art the remnant of her kinred,}"
67,6,12,"{\cf2 And the mayde is faire and wise: nowe therefore heare me, & I wil speake to her father, that we may make the mariage when we are returned from Rages: for I know that Raguel can not marry her to another according to the lawe of Moyses: els he should deserue death, because the right doth rather apperteine to thee then to any other man.}"
67,6,13,"{\cf2 Then the yong man answered the Angel, I haue heard, brother Azarias, that this mayde hath bene giuen to seuen men, who all dyed in the marriage chamber;}"
67,6,14,"{\cf2 And I am the only begotten sonne of my father, and I am afraid, least I go in to her, and dye as the other before: for a wicked spirite loueth her, which hurteth no body, but those which come in to her: wherefore I also feare least I die, and bring my fathers and my mothers life because of mee to the graue with sorowe: for they haue no other sonne to bury them.}"
67,6,15,"{\cf2 Then the Angel sayde vnto him, Doest thou not remember the preceptes which thy father gaue thee, that thou shouldest marry a wife of thine owne kinred? wherefore heare me, O my brother: for she shall be thy wife, neither be thou carefull of the euill spirit: for this same night shall she be giuen thee in marriage.}"
67,6,16,"{\cf2 And when thou shalt goe into the marriage chamber, thou shalt take of the hote coles for perfumes, and make a perfume of the heart, and of the liuer of the fish,}"
67,6,17,"{\cf2 Which if the spirit do smel, he wil flee away, and nether come againe any more: but when thou shalt come to her, rise vp both of you, and pray to God which is mercifull, who wil haue pitie on you, and saue you: feare not, for she is appoynted vnto thee from the beginning, and thou shalt keepe her, and she shall go with thee: moreouer I suppose that she shall beare thee children: nowe when Tobias had heard these things, he loued her, and his heart was effectually ioyned to her.}"
67,7,1,"{\cf2 And when they were come to Ecbatane, they came to the house of Raguel: and Sarra met them, and after they had saluted one another, shee brought them into the house.}"
67,7,2,"{\cf2 Then sayde Raguel to Edna his wife, Howe like is this yong man to Tobit my cousin!}"
67,7,3,"{\cf2 And Raguel asked, Whence are you, my brethren? To whome they sayd, that they were of the tribe of Nephthalim, and of the captiues that dwelt at Nineue.}"
67,7,4,"{\cf2 Then he sayde to them, Doe ye knowe Tobit our kinsman? And they sayd, We know him. Then said he, Is he in good health?}"
67,7,5,"{\cf2 And they sayde, Hee is both aliue, and in good health: and Tobias sayd, He is my father.}"
67,7,6,"{\cf2 Then Raguel leaped, and kissed him, & wept,}"
67,7,7,"{\cf2 And blessed him, and sayde vnto him, Thou art the sonne of an honest and good man: but when he had heard that Tobit was blinde, he was sorowfull and wept.}"
67,7,8,"{\cf2 And likewise Edna his wife, and Sarra his daughter wept. Moreouer they receiued them with a ready minde, and after that they had killed a ram of the flocke, they set much meat on the table. The sayd Tobias to Raphael, Brother Azarias, put forth those things whereof thou spakest in the way, that this businesse may be dispatched.}"
67,7,9,"{\cf2 So he communicated the matter with Raguel, and Raguel sayde to Tobias, Eate, and drinke, and make merry.}"
67,7,10,"{\cf2 For it is meete that thou shouldest marrie my daughter: neuerthelesse, I will declare vnto thee the trueth.}"
67,7,11,"{\cf2 I haue giuen my daughter in marriage to seuen men, who dyed that night which they came in vnto her: neuerthelesse, be thou of a good courage and merry. But Tobias sayde, I will eate nothing here, vntill yee bring her hither, and betrothe her to me.}"
67,7,12,"{\cf2 Raguel sayd then, Marry her then according to the custome: for thou art her cousin, and shee is thine. God which is mercifull, make this prosperous to you in all good things.}"
67,7,13,"{\cf2 Then hee called his daughter Sarra, and shee came to her father, and he tooke her by the hande, and gaue her for wife to Tobias, saying, Beholde, take her after the lawe of Moyses, and leade her away to thy father: and he blessed them,}"
67,7,14,"{\cf2 And called his wife Edna, and hee tooke a booke and wrote a contract, and sealed it.}"
67,7,15,"{\cf2 Then they began to eate.}"
67,7,16,"{\cf2 After, Raguel called his wife Edna, and sayde vnto her, Sister, prepare another chamber, and bring her in thither.}"
67,7,17,"{\cf2 Which when she had done, as he had bidden her, shee brought her thither: then Sarra wept, and her mother wiped away her daughters teares,}"
67,7,18,"{\cf2 And sayde vnto her, Be of good comfort, my daughter: the Lorde of heauen and earth giue thee ioy for this thy sorowe: bee of good comfort my daughter.}"
67,8,1,"{\cf2 And when they had supped, they brought Tobias in vnto her.}"
67,8,2,"{\cf2 And as he went, he remembred the wordes of Raphael, and tooke coles for perfumes, and put the heart and liuer of the fish thereupon, and made a perfume.}"
67,8,3,"{\cf2 The which smell when the euill spirit had smelled, he fled into the vtmost partes of Egypt, whom the Angel bound.}"
67,8,4,"{\cf2 And after that they were both shut in, Tobias rose out of the bed, and sayd, Sister, arise and let vs pray, that God would haue pitie on vs.}"
67,8,5,"{\cf2 Then began Tobias to say, Blessed art thou, O God of our fathers, and blessed is thine holy and glorious Name for euer: let the heauens blesse thee, and all thy creatures.}"
67,8,6,"{\cf2 Thou madest Adam, and gauest him Eua his wife for an helpe, and stay: of them came mankinde: thou hast sayde, It is not good, that a man should be alone: let vs make vnto him an ayde like vnto himselfe.}"
67,8,7,"{\cf2 And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for fornication, but vprightly: therfore graunt me mercie, that we may become aged together.}"
67,8,8,"{\cf2 And she sayd with him, Amen.}"
67,8,9,"{\cf2 So they slept both that night, and Raguel arose, and went and made a graue,}"
67,8,10,"{\cf2 Saying, Is not he dead also?}"
67,8,11,"{\cf2 But when Raguel was come into his house,}"
67,8,12,"{\cf2 He sayde to his wife Edna, Sende one of the maides, and let them see whether he be aliue: if not, that I may bury him, and none knowe it.}"
67,8,13,"{\cf2 So the maide opened the doore, and went in, and found them both asleepe,}"
67,8,14,"{\cf2 And came forth, & told them that he was aliue.}"
67,8,15,"{\cf2 Then Raguel praysed God, and sayd, O God, thou art worthy to be praysed with al pure, and holy prayse: therefore let thy Saintes prayse thee with all thy creatures, and let all thine Angels and thine elect prayse thee for euer.}"
67,8,16,"{\cf2 Thou art to be praised, O Lord: for thou hast made me ioyfull, and that is not come to me which I suspected: but thou hast dealt with vs according to great mercie.}"
67,8,17,"{\cf2 Thou art to be praised because thou hast had mercy of two that were ye onely begotten children of their fathers: graunt them mercy, O Lord, and finish their life in health with ioy and mercy.}"
67,8,18,"{\cf2 Then Raguel bade his seruants to fil ye graue.}"
67,8,19,"{\cf2 And hee kept the wedding feast foureteene dayes.}"
67,8,20,"{\cf2 For Raguel had sayde vnto him by an othe, that he shoulde not depart before that the foureteene dayes of the marriage were expired,}"
67,8,21,"{\cf2 And then hee shoulde take the halfe of his goods and returne in safety to his father, & shoulde haue the rest, when he and his wife were dead.}"
67,9,1,"{\cf2 Then Tobias called Raphael, and sayde vnto him,}"
67,9,2,"{\cf2 Brother Azarias, take with thee a seruant and two camels, and goe to Rages of the Medes to Gabael, and bring mee the money and bring him to the wedding.}"
67,9,3,"{\cf2 For Raguel hath sworne that I shall not depart.}"
67,9,4,"{\cf2 But my father counteth the dayes: and if I tarie long, he will be very sory.}"
67,9,5,"{\cf2 So Raphael went out & came to Gabael, and gaue him the hande writing, who brought forth bagges which were sealed vp, and gaue the to him.}"
67,9,6,"{\cf2 And in the morning they went forth, both together, and came to the wedding; Tobias begate his wife with childe.}"
67,10,1,"{\cf2 Nowe Tobit his father counted euery day, and when the dayes of the iourney were expired, and they came not,}"
67,10,2,"{\cf2 Tobit sayde, Are they not mocked? or is not Gabael dead, and there is no man to giue him the money?}"
67,10,3,"{\cf2 Therefore he was very sory.}"
67,10,4,"{\cf2 Then his wife sayd to him, My sonne is dead, seeing he tarieth: and she began to bewayle him, and sayde,}"
67,10,5,"{\cf2 Nowe I care for nothing, my sonne, since I haue lost thee the light of mine eyes.}"
67,10,6,"{\cf2 To whom Tobit sayd, Holde thy peace: be not carefull, for he is safe.}"
67,10,7,"{\cf2 But she sayd, Holde thy peace, and deceiue me not: my sonne is dead: and she went out euery day by the way, which they went, neither did shee eate meate on the day time, and did consume whole nightes in bewayling her sonne Tobias vntill the foureteene dayes of ye wedding were expired, which Raguel had sworne, that he should tary there. Then Tobias sayde to Raguel, Let mee goe: for my father and my mother looke no more to see me.}"
67,10,8,"{\cf2 But his father in lawe sayde vnto him, Tarie with mee, and I will sende to thy father, and they shall declare him thine affaires.}"
67,10,9,"{\cf2 But Tobias sayde, No, but let mee goe to my father.}"
67,10,10,"{\cf2 Then Raguel arose, and gaue him Sarra his wife, and halfe his goods, as seruants, and cattel, and money,}"
67,10,11,"{\cf2 And hee blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heauen make you, my children, to prosper before I dye.}"
67,10,12,"{\cf2 And he sayd to his daughter, Honour thy father, and thy mother in lawe which are nowe thy parents, that I may heare good report of thee: and hee kissed them, Edna also sayde to Tobias, The Lord of heauen restore thee, my deare brother, and graunt that I may see thy children of my daughter Sarra, that I may reioyce before the Lord. Beholde nowe, I commit to thee my daughter, as a pledge doe not entreat her euill.}"
67,11,1,"{\cf2 After these thinges Tobias went his way, praysing God that hee had giuen him a prosperous iourney, and blessed Raguel and Edna his wife, and went on his way till he drewe neere to Nineue.}"
67,11,2,"{\cf2 Then Raphael said to Tobias, Thou knowest, brother, howe thou diddest leaue thy father.}"
67,11,3,"{\cf2 Let vs haste before thy wife, and prepare the house,}"
67,11,4,"{\cf2 And take in thine hand the gall of the fish. So they went their way, and the dog followed them.}"
67,11,5,"{\cf2 Nowe Anna sate in the way looking for her sonne,}"
67,11,6,"{\cf2 Whom when she sawe comming, she sayd to his father, Behold, thy sonne cometh, and the man that went with him.}"
67,11,7,"{\cf2 Then sayd Raphael, I knowe, Tobias, that thy father shall receiue his sight.}"
67,11,8,"{\cf2 Therefore anoynt his eyes with the gall, and being pricked therewith, he shall rub and make the whitenesse to fall away, and shall see thee.}"
67,11,9,"{\cf2 Then Anna ranne foorth, and fell on the necke of her sonne, and sayde vnto him, Seeing I haue seene thee, my sonne, from henceforth I am content to die, and they wept both.}"
67,11,10,"{\cf2 Tobit also went forth toward the doore, and stumbled, but his sonne ranne vnto him.}"
67,11,11,"{\cf2 And tooke hold of his father and sprinkled of the gall on his fathers eyes, saying, Bee of good hope, my father.}"
67,11,12,"{\cf2 And when his eyes began to pricke, he rubbed them.}"
67,11,13,"{\cf2 And the whitenes pilled away from the corners of his eyes, and when he sawe his sonne, he fell vpon his necke,}"
67,11,14,"{\cf2 And hee wept and sayde, Blessed art thou, O Lorde, and blessed be thy Name for euer, and blessed be all thine holy Angels.}"
67,11,15,"{\cf2 For thou hast scourged me, and hast had pitie on me: for beholde, I see my sonne Tobias: and his sonne, being glad went in, and tolde his father the great things that had come to passe in Media.}"
67,11,16,"{\cf2 Then Tobit went out to meete his daughter in lawe, reioycing and praysing God to the gate of Nineue and they which saw him go, marueiled, because he had receiued his sight.}"
67,11,17,"{\cf2 But Tobit testified before the al, that God had had pitie on him; when he came neere to Sarra his daughter in lawe, he blessed her, saying, Thou art welcome, daughter: God be blessed, which hath brought thee vnto vs, and blessed be thy father: and there was great ioy among all his brethren which were at Nineue.}"
67,11,18,"{\cf2 And Achiacharus and Nasbas his brothers sonne came.}"
67,11,19,"{\cf2 And Tobias marriage was kept seuen dayes with great ioy.}"
67,12,1,"{\cf2 Then Tobit called his sonne Tobias, and sayde vnto him, Prouide, my sonne, wages for ye man, which went with thee, & thou must giue him more.}"
67,12,2,"{\cf2 And he sayd vnto him, O father, it shall not grieue me to giue him halfe of those things which I haue brought.}"
67,12,3,"{\cf2 For he hath brought mee againe to thee in safetie, and hath made whole my wife, and hath brought me ye money, & hath likewise healed thee.}"
67,12,4,"{\cf2 Then the olde man sayd, It is due vnto him.}"
67,12,5,"{\cf2 So he called the Angel, and sayde vnto him, Take halfe of all that ye haue brought, and goe away in safetie.}"
67,12,6,"{\cf2 But he tooke them both apart, and said vnto them, Prayse God, and confesse him, and giue him the glory, and prayse him for the things which he hath done vnto you before all them that liue. It is good to praise God, and to exalt his Name, and to shewe forth his euident workes with honour: therefore be not weary to confesse him.}"
67,12,7,"{\cf2 It is good to keepe close the secrets of a King, but it is honorable to reueile the works of God: do that which is good, and no euil shal touch you.}"
67,12,8,"{\cf2 Prayer is good with fasting, and almes, and righteousnesse. A litle with righteousnesse is better then much with vnrighteousnes: it is better to giue almes then to lay vp golde.}"
67,12,9,"{\cf2 For almes doth deliuer from death, & doeth purge all sinne. Those which exercise almes & righteousnes, shalbe filled with life.}"
67,12,10,"{\cf2 But they that sinne, are enemies to their owne life.}"
67,12,11,"{\cf2 Surely I will keepe close nothing from you: neuertheles, I said it was good to keepe close the secret of a King, but that it was honorable to reueile the workes of God.}"
67,12,12,"{\cf2 Nowe therefore when thou diddest pray, and Sarra thy daughter in lawe, I did bring to memorie your prayer before the Holy one: and when thou diddest bury the dead, I was with thee likewise.}"
67,12,13,"{\cf2 And when thou wast not griued to rise vp, and leaue thy dinner to bury the dead, thy good deede was not hid from me: but I was with thee.}"
67,12,14,"{\cf2 And nowe God hath sent me to heale thee, and Sarra thy daughter in lawe.}"
67,12,15,"{\cf2 I am Raphael one of the seuen holy Angels, which present the prayers of the Saincts, and which go forth before his holy maiestie.}"
67,12,16,"{\cf2 Then they were both troubled, and fel vpon their face: for they feared.}"
67,12,17,"{\cf2 But he said vnto them, Feare not, for it shall go well with you: prayse God therefore.}"
67,12,18,"{\cf2 For I came not of mine owne pleasure, but by the good wil of your God: wherefore praise him in all ages.}"
67,12,19,"{\cf2 Al these dayes I did appeare vnto you, but I did neither eate nor drinke, but you saw it in visio.}"
67,12,20,"{\cf2 Now therefore giue God thanks: for I go vp to him that sent me: but write all things which are done, in a booke.}"
67,12,21,"{\cf2 And when they rose, they saw him no more.}"
67,12,22,"{\cf2 Then they confessed the great and wonderfull works of God, and how the Angel of the Lord had appeared to them.}"
67,13,1,"{\cf2 Then Tobit wrote a prayer of reioycing, and sayd, Blessed be God that liueth for euer, and blessed be his kingdome.}"
67,13,2,"{\cf2 For he doeth scourge, and hath pitie: he leadeth to hell, and bringeth vp, neither is there any that can auoyde his hand.}"
67,13,3,"{\cf2 Cofesse him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel: for he hath scattered you among them.}"
67,13,4,"{\cf2 There declare his greatnesse, and extoll him before all the liuing: for he is our Lord & our God and our Father for euer.}"
67,13,5,"{\cf2 He hath scourged vs for our iniquities, and will haue mercie againe, and wil gather vs out of all nations, among whome we are scattered.}"
67,13,6,"{\cf2 If you turne to him with your whole heart, and with your whole minde, & deale vprightly before him, then will he turne vnto you, and will not hide his face from you, but ye shal see what he will doe with you: therefore confesse him with your whole mouth, & praise the Lord of righteousnes, & extoll the euerlasting King. I wil cofesse him in the land of my captiuitie, and will declare his power, & greatnes to a sinfull nation. O ye sinners, turne and do iustice before him: who can tell if he wil receiue you to mercy, and haue pitie on you?}"

68,1,7,"{\cf2 And Nabuchodonosor King of the Assyrians sent vnto all that dwelt in Persia, & to all that dwelt in the West, and to those that dwelt in Cilicia, and Damascus, and Libanus & Antilibanus, and to all that dwelt vpon the sea coast,}"

68,2,14,"{\cf2 Then Olofernes went forth from the presence of his Lord, & called all the gouernours, and captaines, and officers of the armie of Assur,}"

68,2,17,"{\cf2 And hee tooke camels & asses for their burdens, a very great number, and sheepe, and oxen, and goates without number for their prouision,}"
68,2,18,"{\cf2 And vitaile for euery man of the army, and very much gold and siluer out of the kings house.}"
68,2,19,"{\cf2 Then he went forth and all his power, to goe before in the viage of king Nabuchodonosor, & to couer all the face of the earth Westward, with their charets, and horsemen, and chosen footemen.}"
68,2,20,"{\cf2 A great multitude also of sundry sorts came with them like grashoppers, and like the grauell of the earth: for the multitude was without number.}"
68,2,21,"{\cf2 And they went forth of Nineue three dayes iourney toward the countrey of Bectileth, and pitched from Bectileth neere the mountaine which is at the left hand of the vpper Cilicia.}"
68,2,22,"{\cf2 Then hee tooke all his armie, his footemen and horsemen, and charets, and went from thence into the mountaines,}"
68,2,23,"{\cf2 And he destroied Phud and Lud, and spoiled all the children of Rasses, and the children of Ismael, which were toward the wildernesse at the South of the Chelians.}"
68,2,24,"{\cf2 Then hee went ouer Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia, and destroyed al the hie cities that were vpon the riuer of Arbonai, vntill one come to the sea.}"
68,2,25,"{\cf2 And he tooke the borders of Cilicia, and destroyed all that resisted him, and came to the borders of Iapheth, which were toward the South and ouer against Arabia.}"
68,2,26,"{\cf2 He compassed also all the children of Madian, and burnt vp their tabernacles, and spoiled their lodges.}"
68,2,27,"{\cf2 Then hee went downe into the countrey of Damascus, in the time of wheate haruest, and burnt vp all their fieldes, and destroyed their flockes and the heards: he robbed their cities, and spoyled their countrey, and smote all their yong men with the edge of the sword.}"
68,2,28,"{\cf2 Therefore feare and trembling fell vpon all the inhabitants of the sea coast, which were in Sidon and Tyrus, and them that dwelt in Sur and Ocina, and all that dwelt in Iemnaan: and they that dwelt in Azotus, and Ascalon feared him greatly.}"
68,3,1,"{\cf2 So they sent ambassadours to him with messages of peace, saying,}"

68,3,8,"{\cf2 Yet he brake downe all their borders, and cut downe their woods: for it was inioyned him to destroy al the gods of the land, that al nations should worship Nabuchodonosor only, & that all tongues and tribes should call vpon him as God.}"
68,3,9,"{\cf2 Also he came against Esdrælon, neere vnto Iudea, ouer against the great straite of Iudea,}"
68,3,10,"{\cf2 And he pitched betweene Geba, and a citie of ye Scythians, & there he taried a moneth, that he might assemble all the baggage of his armie.}"
68,4,1,"{\cf2 Nowe the children of Israel that dwelt in Iudea, heard all that Olofernes ye chiefe captaine of Nabuchodonosor King of the Assyrians had done to the nations, and howe hee had spoyled all their temples, and brought them to nought.}"
68,4,2,"{\cf2 Therefore they feared greatly his presence, and were troubled for Ierusalem, and for the Temple of the Lord their God.}"

68,4,4,"{\cf2 Therefore they sent into all the coastes of Samaria, and the villages, and to Bethoro, and Belmen, and Iericho, and to Choba, and Esora, and to the valley of Salem,}"
68,4,5,"{\cf2 And tooke all the toppes of the hie mountaines, and walled the villages that were in the, and put in vitailes for the prouision of warre: for their fieldes were of late reaped.}"
68,4,6,"{\cf2 Also Ioacim the hie Priest which was in those dayes in Ierusale, wrote to them that dwelt in Bethulia & Betomastham, which is ouer against Esdraelon toward the open countrey nere to Dothaim,}"
68,4,7,"{\cf2 Exhorting them to keepe the passages of the mountaines: for by them there was an entrie into Iudea, and it was easie to let them that woulde come vp, because ye passage was streit for two men at the most.}"
68,4,8,"{\cf2 And the children of Israel did as Ioacim ye hie Priest had commanded them with the Ancients of all the people of Israel, which dwelt at Ierusalem.}"
68,4,9,"{\cf2 Then cried euery man of Israel to God with great feruencie, and their soules with great affectio.}"
68,4,10,"{\cf2 Both they, and their wiues, and their children, and their cattell, and euery stranger, and hireling, and their bought seruantes put sackcloth vpon their loynes.}"
68,4,11,"{\cf2 Thus euery man and woman, and the children, and the inhabitantes of Ierusalem fell before the Temple, and sprinkled ashes vpon their heads, and spred out their sackcloth before the face of the Lord: also they put sackcloth about the altar,}"
68,4,12,"{\cf2 And cried to the God of Israel, all with one consent most earnestly, that hee woulde not giue their children for a pray, and their wiues for a spoile, and the cities of their inheritance to destructio, and the Sanctuarie to pollution and reproch, and vnto derision to the heathen.}"
68,4,13,"{\cf2 So God heard their prayers, and looked vpon their affliction: for the people fasted many dayes in al Iudea and Ierusalem before the Sanctuary of the Lord almightie.}"
68,4,14,"{\cf2 And Ioacim the high Priest, and all the Priests that stoode before the Lorde, and ministred vnto the Lord, had their loines girt with sackcloth, and offred the continuall burnt offring, with prayers and the free gifts of the people,}"

68,5,8,"{\cf2 But they went out of the way of their ancesters and worshipped the God of heauen, the God whom they knewe: so they cast them out from the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and soiourned there many dayes.}"
68,5,9,"{\cf2 Then their God commaunded them to depart from the place where they soiourned, and to go into the land of Chanaan, where they dwelt, and were increased with golde and siluer, and with very much cattell.}"
68,5,10,"{\cf2 But when a famine couered all the lande of Chanaan, they went downe into Egypt, and dwelt there till they returned, and became there a great multitude, so that one could not number their linage.}"
68,5,11,"{\cf2 Therfore the king of Egypt rose vp against them, and vsed deceite against them, and brought them lowe with labouring in bricke, and made them slaues.}"
68,5,12,"{\cf2 Then they cried vnto their God, & he smote all the land of Egypt with incurable plagues: so the Egyptians cast them out of their sight.}"
68,5,13,"{\cf2 And God dried ye red sea in their presence,}"
68,5,14,"{\cf2 And brought them into mount Sina and Cades barne, and cast foorth all that dwelt in the wildernesse.}"

68,5,18,"{\cf2 But when they departed from the way which he appoynted them, they were destroyed in many battels after a wonderfull sort, and were led captiues into a land that was not theirs and the Temple of their God was cast to the grounde, and their cities were taken by the enemies.}"
68,5,19,"{\cf2 But nowe they are turned to their God, and are come vp from the scattering wherein they were scattered, and haue possessed Ierusalem, where their Temple is, and dwell in the mountaines which were desolate.}"

68,5,22,"{\cf2 And when Achior had finished these sayings, all the people, standing round about the tent, murmured: and the chiefe men of Olofernes, and all that dwelt by the sea side and in Moab, spake that he should kill him.}"

68,7,1,"{\cf2 The next day, Olofernes commaunded all his armie and all his people, which were come to take his part, that they should remoue their camps against Bethulia, and that they shoulde take all the streites of the hill, and to make warre against the children of Israel.}"
68,7,2,"{\cf2 Then their strong men remoued their camps in that day, and the armie of the men of warre was an hundreth thousand and seuentie footemen, and twelue thousande horsemen, beside the baggage & other men that were afoote among them, a very great multitude.}"
68,7,3,"{\cf2 And they camped in the plaine neere vnto Bethulia, by the fountaine, and they spred abroade towarde Dothaim vnto Belbaim, and in length from Bethulia vnto Ciamon, which is ouer against Esdraelom.}"
68,7,4,"{\cf2 Nowe the children of Israel, when they sawe the multitude, were greatly troubled, and said euery one to his neighbour, Nowe will they shut vp all the whole earth: for neither the hye mountaines nor the valleyes, nor the hilles are able to abide their burden.}"
68,7,5,"{\cf2 Then euery one tooke his weapons of warre, and burning fires in their towres, they remained and watched all that night.}"
68,7,6,"{\cf2 But in the seconde day, Olofernes brought foorth all his horsemen in the sight of the children of Israel, which were in Bethulia,}"
68,7,7,"{\cf2 And viewed the passages vp to their citie, & came to the fountaines of their waters, and tooke them and set garrisons of men of warre ouer them, and remoued towarde his people.}"
68,7,8,"{\cf2 Then came vnto him all the chiefe of ye children of Esau, & all the gouernours of the people of Moab, and all the captaines of the sea coast, & said,}"
68,7,9,"{\cf2 Let our captaine nowe heare a worde, least an inconuenience come in thine armie.}"
68,7,10,"{\cf2 For this people of the children of Israel doe not trust in their speares, but in the height of the mountaines, wherein they dwell, because it is not easie to come vp to the tops of their mountaines.}"
68,7,11,"{\cf2 Nowe therefore, my lorde, fight not against them in battell aray, and there shall not so much as one man of thy people perish.}"
68,7,12,"{\cf2 Remaine in thy campe, & keepe all the men of thine armie, and let thy men keepe still the water of the countrey, that commeth foorth at the foote of the mountaine.}"
68,7,13,"{\cf2 For al the inhabitants of Bethulia haue their water thereof: so shall thirst kill them, and they shall giue vp their citie: and we and our people wil goe vp to the toppes of the mountaines that are neere, and will campe vpon them, and watch that none goe out of the citie.}"
68,7,14,"{\cf2 So they and their wiues, and their children shalbe consumed with famine, & before the sworde come against them, they shall be ouerthrowen in the streetes where they dwell.}"
68,7,15,"{\cf2 Thus shalt thou render them an euil reward, because they rebelled and obeyed not thy person peaceably.}"
68,7,16,"{\cf2 And these wordes pleased Olofernes and all his souldiers, and he appointed to doe as they had spoken.}"
68,7,17,"{\cf2 So the campe of the children of Ammon departed, & with the fiue thousande of the Assyrians, and they pitched in the valley, & tooke ye waters, & the fountaines of ye waters of the children of Israel.}"
68,7,18,"{\cf2 Then the children of Esau went vp with the children of Ammon, & camped in the mountaines ouer against Dothaim, and they sent some of them selues toward the South, and toward the East, ouer against Rebel, which is neere vnto Chusi, that is vpon the riuer Mochmur: and the rest of the armie of the Assyrians camped in the fielde, and couered the whole lande: for their tents and their baggage were pitched in a wonderfull great place.}"
68,7,19,"{\cf2 Then the children of Israel cryed vnto the Lorde their God, because their heart fayled: for all their enemies had compassed them about, and there was no waye to escape out from among them.}"
68,7,20,"{\cf2 Thus all the companie of Assur remained about them, both their footemen, chariots & horsemen, foure & thirtie dayes: so that euen all the places of their waters fayled all ye inhabitants of Bethulia.}"
68,7,21,"{\cf2 And the cisternes were emptie, and they had not water ynough to drinke for one day: for they gaue them to drinke by measure.}"
68,7,22,"{\cf2 Therefore their children swooned, and their wiues and yong men failed for thirst, & fell downe in the streetes of the citie, and by the passages of the gates, and there was no strength in them.}"
68,7,23,"{\cf2 Then all the people assembled to Ozias, and to the chiefe of the citie, both yong men and women, and children, and cryed with a loude voyce, and said before all the Elders,}"
68,7,24,"{\cf2 The Lord iudge betweene vs and you: for you haue done vs great iniurie, in that ye haue not required peace of the children of Assur.}"
68,7,25,"{\cf2 For now we haue no helper: but God hath sold vs into their hands, that we should be throwen downe before them with thirst & great destructio.}"
68,7,26,"{\cf2 Nowe therefore call them together, and deliuer the whole citie for a spoyle to the people of Olofernes, and to all his armie.}"
68,7,27,"{\cf2 For it is better for vs to be made a spoyle vnto them, then to die for thirst: for we will bee his seruants that we may liue, and not see the death of our infants before our eyes, nor our wiues, nor our children to die.}"
68,7,28,"{\cf2 We take to witnesse against you the heauen and the earth, and our God and Lorde of our fathers, which punisheth vs, according to our sinnes and the sinnes of our fathers, that he lay not these things to our charge.}"
68,7,29,"{\cf2 Then there was a great cry of all with one consent in the middes of the assemblie, and they cryed vnto the Lord God with a loude voyce.}"
68,7,30,"{\cf2 Then said Ozias to the, Brethren, be of good courage: let vs waite yet fiue dayes, in the which space the Lorde our God may turne his mercie towarde vs: for he will not forsake vs in the ende.}"
68,7,31,"{\cf2 And if these dayes passe, and there come not helpe vnto vs, I will doe according to your worde.}"
68,7,32,"{\cf2 So he separated the people, euery one vnto their charge, and they went vnto the walles and towers of their citie, and sent their wiues and their children into their houses, and they were very lowe brought in the citie.}"
68,8,1,"{\cf2 Nowe at that time, Iudeth heard thereof, which was the daughter of Merari the sonne of Ox, the sonne of Ioseph, the sonne of Oziel, the sonne of Elcia, the sonne of Ananias, the sonne of Gedeon, the sonne of Raphaim, the sonne of Acito, the sonne of Eliu, the sonne of Eliab, the sonne of Nathanael, the sonne of Samael, the sonne of Salasadai, the sonne of Israel.}"
68,8,2,"{\cf2 And Manasses was her husband, of her stocke and kinred, who dyed in the barley haruest.}"
68,8,3,"{\cf2 For as he was diligent ouer them that bound sheaues in the fielde, the heate came vpon his head, and he fell vpon his bed, and dyed in the citie of Bethulia, and they buryed him with his fathers in the fielde betweene Dothaim and Balamo.}"
68,8,4,"{\cf2 So Iudeth was in her house a widowe three yeeres and foure moneths.}"
68,8,5,"{\cf2 And she made her a tent vpon her house, and put on sackecloth on her loynes, and ware her widowes apparell.}"
68,8,6,"{\cf2 And she fasted all the dayes of her widowhood, saue the day before the Sabbath & the Sabbaths, and the day before the newe moones, and in the feastes & solemne dayes of the house of Israel.}"
68,8,7,"{\cf2 She was also of a goodly countenance and very beautifull to beholde: and her husbande Manasses had left her golde and siluer, and men seruants, and maide seruants, and cattell, and possessions, where she remained.}"
68,8,8,"{\cf2 And there was none that coulde bring an euill report of her: for she feared God greatly.}"
68,8,9,"{\cf2 Now when she heard the euil wordes of the people against the gouernour, because they faintedfor lacke of waters (for Iudeth had hearde all the wordes that Ozias had spoken vnto them, and that hee had sworne vnto them to deliuer the citie vnto the Assyrians within fiue dayes)}"
68,8,10,"{\cf2 Then she sent her maide, that had the gouernement of all things that she had, to call Ozias and Chabris and Charmisthe Ancients of the citie.}"
68,8,11,"{\cf2 And they came vnto her, and she sayde vnto them, Heare me, O ye gouernors of the inhabitantes of Bethulia: for your words that ye haue spoken before the people this day, are not right, touching this othe which yee made and pronounced betweene God and you, and haue promised to deliuer the citie to the enemies, vnlesse within these dayes the Lord turne to helpe you.}"
68,8,12,"{\cf2 And nowe who are you that haue tempted God this day, & set your selues in the place of God among the children of men?}"
68,8,13,"{\cf2 So now you seeke the Lorde almightie, but you shall neuer know any thing.}"
68,8,14,"{\cf2 For you cannot finde out the depth of the heart of man, neither can yee perceiue the thinges that hee thinketh: then howe can you search out God, that hath made all these things, and knowe his minde, or comprehende his purpose? Nay my brethren, prouoke not the Lord our God to anger.}"
68,8,15,"{\cf2 For if he will not helpe vs within these fiue dayes, he hath power to defend vs whe he will, euen euery day, or to destroy vs before our enemies.}"
68,8,16,"{\cf2 Doe not you therefore binde the counsels of the Lord our God: For God is not as man that he may be threatned, neither as the sonne of man to be brought to iudgement.}"
68,8,17,"{\cf2 Therefore let vs wayte for saluation of him and call vpon him to helpe vs, and hee will heare our voice if it please him.}"
68,8,18,"{\cf2 For there appeareth none in our age, neither is there any nowe in these dayes, neither tribe, nor familie, nor people, nor citie among vs, which worship ye gods made with hands, as hath bene aforetime.}"
68,8,19,"{\cf2 For the which cause our fathers were giuen to the sworde, and for a spoyle, and had a great fall before our enemies.}"
68,8,20,"{\cf2 But we know none other God: therefore we trust that he will not despise vs, nor any of our linage.}"
68,8,21,"{\cf2 Neither when we shalbe taken, shal Iudea be so famous: for our Sanctuarie shalbe spoyled, & he will require the prophanation therof at our mouth,}"
68,8,22,"{\cf2 And the feare of our brethren, and the captiuitie of the countrey, and the desolation of our inheritance will he turne vpon our heades among the Gentiles, wheresoeuer we shalbe in bondage, & we shall be an offence and a reproche to all them that possesse vs.}"
68,8,23,"{\cf2 For our seruitude shall not be directed by fauour, but ye Lord our God shal turne it to dishonour.}"
68,8,24,"{\cf2 Now therefore, O brethren, let vs shew an example to our brethren, because their heartes depend vpon vs, and the Sanctuarie, and the House, and the altar rest vpon vs.}"
68,8,25,"{\cf2 Moreouer, let vs giue thankes to ye Lord our God, which tryeth vs euen as hee did our fathers.}"
68,8,26,"{\cf2 Remember what things he did to Abraha, and how he tryed Isaac, & al that he did to Iacob in Mesopotamia of Syria when he kept the sheepe of Laban his mothers brother.}"
68,8,27,"{\cf2 For hee hath not tried vs as he did them to the examination of their heartes, neither doth hee take vengeance on vs, but the Lorde punisheth for instruction them that come neere to him.}"
68,8,28,"{\cf2 Then said Ozias to her, All that thou hast spoken, hast thou spoken with a good heart, and there is none that is able to resist thy words.}"
68,8,29,"{\cf2 For it is not to day that thy wisedome is knowen, but from the beginning of thy life all the people haue knowen thy wisedome: for the deuice of thine heart is good.}"
68,8,30,"{\cf2 But the people were very thirstie, and compelled vs to do vnto the, as we haue spoken, & haue brought vs to an oth which we may not transgresse.}"
68,8,31,"{\cf2 Therefore now pray for vs, because thou art an holy woman, that the Lord may send vs raine to fill our cisternes, and that we may faint no more.}"
68,8,32,"{\cf2 Then sayd Iudeth vnto them, Heare mee, & I will doe a thing, which shall bee declared in all generations, to the children of our nation.}"
68,8,33,"{\cf2 You shal stand this night in the gate, & I wil go forth with mine handmaide: & within ye dayes that ye haue promised to deliuer the citie to our enemies, the Lord wil visite Israel by mine hand.}"
68,8,34,"{\cf2 But inquire not you of mine acte: for I will not declare it vnto you, till the things be finished that I doe.}"
68,8,35,"{\cf2 Then saide Ozias and the princes vnto her, Goe in peace, and the Lorde God be before thee, to take vengeance on our enemies.}"
68,8,36,"{\cf2 So they returned from the tent, and went to their wardes.}"
68,9,1,"{\cf2 Then Iudeth fell vpon her face, and put ashes vpon her head, and put off the sackcloth wherwith she was clothed; about the time that the incense of that euening was offred in Ierusalem in the house of the Lorde, Iudeth cryed with a loude voyce, and saide,}"
68,9,2,"{\cf2 O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gauest a sworde to take vengeance of ye strangers which opened the wombe of the maide, and defiled her, and discouered the thigh with shame, & polluted the wombe to reproche (for thou haddest commanded that it should not so be,}"
68,9,3,"{\cf2 Yet they did things for the which thou gauest their princes to the slaughter, for they were deceiued and washed their beds with bloud) and hast striken the seruants with the gouerners, and the gouerners vpon their thrones,}"
68,9,4,"{\cf2 And hast giuen their wiues for a pray & their daughters to be captiues, and all their spoyles for a bootie to the children that thou louedst: which were mooued with thy zeale, & abhorred the pollution of their bloud, & called vpon thee for ayde, O God, O my God, heare me also a widdowe.}"
68,9,5,"{\cf2 For thou hast wrought the things afore, and these, and the things that shalbe after, and thou considerest the things that are present, and the things that are to come.}"
68,9,6,"{\cf2 For the things which thou doest purpose, are present, and say, Beholde, wee are here: for all thy wayes are readie, and thy iudgements are foreknowen.}"
68,9,7,"{\cf2 Behold, the Assyrians are multyplied by their power: they haue exalted them selues with horses and horsemen: they glory in the strength of their footemen: they trust in shield, speare and bow, and sling, and do not know that thou art the Lord that breakest the battels: the Lord is thy Name.}"
68,9,8,"{\cf2 Breake thou their strength by thy power, and breake their force by thy wrath: for they haue purposed to defile thy Sanctuarie, and to pollute the Tabernacle where thy glorious Name resteth, and to cast downe with weapons the hornes of the Altar.}"
68,9,9,"{\cf2 Behold their pride, and send thy wrath vpon their heads: giue into mine hand which am a widow, the strength that I haue conceiued.}"
68,9,10,"{\cf2 Smite by the deceite of my lippes the seruant with the prince, and the prince with the seruant: abate their height by the hand of a woman.}"
68,9,11,"{\cf2 For thy power standeth not in the multitude, nor thy might in strong men: but thou, O Lorde, art the helpe of the humble and little ones, the defender of the weake, and the protector of them that are forsaken, and the Sauiour of them that are without hope.}"
68,9,12,"{\cf2 Surely, surely thou art the God of my father, and the God of the inheritance of Israel, the Lorde of heauen and earth, the creator of the waters, the King of all creatures: heare thou my prayer,}"
68,9,13,"{\cf2 And graunt me words and craft, & a wound, & a stroke against the that enterprise cruel things against thy couenat, and against thine holy House, and against the toppe of Sion, & against the house of the possession of thy children.}"
68,9,14,"{\cf2 Shew euidently among all thy people, and al the tribes, that they may know that thou art ye God of all power and strength, and that there is none other that defendeth the people of Israel, but thou.}"
68,10,1,"{\cf2 Nowe after she had ceased to cry vnto the God of Israel, and had made an ende of all these wordes,}"
68,10,2,"{\cf2 She rose where she had fallen down, & called her maide, and went downe into the house, in the which she abode in the Sabbath dayes and in the feast dayes,}"
68,10,3,"{\cf2 And putting away the sackecloth wherewith she was clad, and putting off the garmentes of her widowhode, shee washed her bodie with water, and anointed it with much oyntment, and dressed the heare of her head, and put attire vpon it, and put on her garments of gladnesse, wherewith shee was clad during the life of Manasses her husbande.}"
68,10,4,"{\cf2 And she put slippers on her feete, and put on bracelets, and sleeues, and rings, and earinges, and all her ornaments, and she decked her selfe brauely to allure the eyes of all men that should see her.}"
68,10,5,"{\cf2 Then she gaue her maide a bottel of wine, & a potte of oyle, and filled a scrip with floure, & with drie figges, and with fine bread: so she lapped vp all these thinges together and layde them vpon her.}"
68,10,6,"{\cf2 Thus they went forth to the gate of the citie of Bethulia, and found standing there Ozias, and the Ancients of the citie, Chabris and Charmis.}"
68,10,7,"{\cf2 And when they sawe her that her face was changed, and that her garment was changed, they marueyled greaely at her wonderfull beautie, and sayde vnto her,}"
68,10,8,"{\cf2 The God, the God of our fathers giue thee fauour, and accomplish thine enterprises to the glory of the children of Israel, and to the exaltation of Ierusalem. Then they worshipped God.}"
68,10,9,"{\cf2 And she said vnto them, Command the gates of the citie to be opened vnto me, that I may goe forth to accomplish the things which you haue spoken to me. So they commanded the yong men to open vnto her, as she had spoken.}"
68,10,10,"{\cf2 And when they had done so, Iudeth went out, she and her maide with her, & the men of the citie looked after her, vntill shee was gone downe the mountaine, and till she had passed the valley, & could see her no more.}"
68,10,11,"{\cf2 Thus they went streight forth in the valley, and the first watch of the Assyrians met her,}"
68,10,12,"{\cf2 And tooke her, and asked her, Of what people art thou? and whence commest thou? and whither goest thou? And shee saide, I am a woman of the Hebrewes, and am fledde from them: for they shall be giuen you to be consumed.}"
68,10,13,"{\cf2 And I come before Olophernes, the chiefe captaine of your armie, to declare him true things, and I will shew before him the way whereby hee shall goe and win al the mountaines, without losing the bodie or life of anie of his men.}"
68,10,14,"{\cf2 Now when the men heard her wordes, and behelde her countenance, they wondred greatly at her beautie, and sayd vnto her,}"
68,10,15,"{\cf2 Thou hast saued thy life, in that thou hast hasted to come downe to the presence of our lorde nowe therefore come to his tent, and some of vs shall conduct thee vntill they haue deliuered thee into his hands.}"
68,10,16,"{\cf2 And when thou standest before him, be not afraide in thine heart, but shew vnto him according as thou hast to say, and hee will intreate thee well.}"
68,10,17,"{\cf2 Then they chose out of them an hundreth men, and prepared a charet for her and her maide, and brought her to the tent of Olophernes.}"
68,10,18,"{\cf2 Then there was a running to and fro, through out the campe: for her comming was bruted amog the tentes: and they came and stoode round about her: for she stood without the tent of Olophernes vntil they had declared vnto him concerning her.}"
68,10,19,"{\cf2 And they marueiled at her beautie, and wondred at the children of Israel because of her, and euery one sayde vnto his neighbour, Who would despise this people, that haue among them such women? surely it is not good that one man of them be left: for if they shoulde remaine, they might deceiue the whole earth.}"
68,10,20,"{\cf2 Then Olophernes garde went out, and all his seruants, and they brought her into the tent.}"
68,10,21,"{\cf2 Now Olophernes rested vpon his bed vnder a conopie, which was wouen with purple and golde and emeraudes, and precious stones.}"
68,10,22,"{\cf2 So they shewed him of her, & he came forth vnto the entrie of his tent, and they caryed lampes of siluer before him.}"
68,10,23,"{\cf2 And when Iudeth was come before him and his seruantes, they all marueyled at the beautie of her countenance, and she fel downe vpon her face, and did reuerence vnto him, and his seruants tooke her vp.}"
68,11,1,"{\cf2 Then sayd Olophernes vnto her, Woman, bee of good comfort: feare not in thine heart: for I neuer hurt any that would serue Nabuchodonosor the King of all the earth.}"
68,11,2,"{\cf2 Now therefore if thy people that dwelleth in the mountaines, had not despysed me, I would not haue lifted vp my speare against them: but they haue procured these things to themselues.}"
68,11,3,"{\cf2 But now tell me wherefore thou art fled from them, and art come vnto vs: for thou art come for sauegard: bee of good comfort, thou shalt liuefrom this night, and hereafter.}"
68,11,4,"{\cf2 For none shall hurt thee, but intreate thee well, as they doe the seruants of King Nabuchodonosor my lorde.}"
68,11,5,"{\cf2 Then Iudeth saide vnto him, Receiue the wordes of thy seruant, and suffer thine handmaide to speake in thy presence, and I will declare no lye to my lorde this night.}"
68,11,6,"{\cf2 And if thou wilt followe the wordes of thine handmaid, God wil bring ye thing perfectly to passe by thee, and my lorde shall not faile of his purpose.}"
68,11,7,"{\cf2 As Nabuchodonosor King of all the earth liueth, and as his power is of force, who hath sent thee to reforme all persons, not onely men shalbe made subiect to him by thee, but also the beastes of the fieldes, and the cattel, and the foules of the heauen shall liue by thy power vnder Nabuchodonosor and all his house.}"
68,11,8,"{\cf2 For we haue heard of thy wisedome and of thy prudent spirite, and it is declared through the whole earth, that thou onely art excellent in all the kingdome, and of a wonderfull knowledge, and in feates of warre marueilous.}"
68,11,9,"{\cf2 Nowe as concerning the matter which Achier did speake in thy councill, we haue heard his wordes: for the men of Bethulia did take him, and he declared vnto them all that he had spoken vnto thee.}"
68,11,10,"{\cf2 Therefore, O lord and gouernour, reiect not his worde, but set it in thine heart, for it is true: for there is no punishment against our people, neither can the sworde preuaile against them, except they sinne against their God.}"
68,11,11,"{\cf2 Nowe therefore, least my lorde shoulde be frustrate, and voyde of his purpose, and that death may fall vpon them, and that they may be taken in their sinne whiles they prouoke their God to anger, which is so oft times as they doe that which is not beseeming,}"
68,11,12,"{\cf2 (For because their vitailes fayle, and all their water is wasted, they haue determined to take their cattell, and haue purposed to consume all things that God had forbidden them to eate by his Lawes:}"
68,11,13,"{\cf2 Yea, they haue purposed to consume the first fruits of the wheat, and the tithes of the wine, & of the oyle which they had reserued and sanctified for the Priestes that serue in Ierusalem before the face of our God: the which things it is not lawfull for any of the people to touch with their handes.}"
68,11,14,"{\cf2 Moreouer, they haue sent to Ierusalem, because they also that dwel there, haue done the like, such as should bring them licence from ye Senate)}"
68,11,15,"{\cf2 Nowe when they shall bring them worde, they will doe it, and they shall be giuen thee to be destroyed the same day.}"
68,11,16,"{\cf2 Wherefore I thine handmaide, knowing all this, am fledde from their presence, and God hath sent me to worke a thing with thee, whereof all the earth shall wonder, and whosoeuer shall heare it.}"
68,11,17,"{\cf2 For thy seruant feareth God, and worshippeth the God of heauen day and night, and nowe let me remaine with thee, my lord, and let thy seruant go out in the night into the valley, and I will pray vnto God, that he may reueile vnto me when they shall commit their sinnes,}"
68,11,18,"{\cf2 And I wil come and shew it vnto thee: then thou shalt goe foorth with all thine armie, and there shall be none of them that shall resist thee.}"
68,11,19,"{\cf2 And I will leade thee through the middes of Iudea, vntill thou come before Ierusalem, and I will set thy throne in the middes thereof, and thou shalt driue them as sheepe that haue no shepherd, and a dogge shall not barke with his mouth against thee: for these things haue bene spoken vnto me, and declared vnto me according to my foreknowledge, and I am sent to shewe thee.}"
68,11,20,"{\cf2 Then her wordes pleased Olofernes, and all his seruants, and they marueiled at her wisedom, and sayde,}"
68,11,21,"{\cf2 There is not such a woman in all the world, both for beautie of face, and wisedome of wordes.}"
68,11,22,"{\cf2 Likewise Olofernes said vnto her, God hath done this, to sende thee before the people, that strength might be in our handes, and destruction vpon them that despise my lorde.}"
68,11,23,"{\cf2 And nowe thou art both beautifull in thy countenance, and wittie in thy wordes: surely if thou doe as thou hast spoken, thy God shall be my God, and thou shalt dwell in the house of Nabuchodonosor, and shalt be renoumed throughout the whole earth.}"
68,12,1,"{\cf2 Then he commanded to bring her in where his treasures were layd, and bade that they should prepare for her of his owne meates, and that she should drinke of his owne wine.}"
68,12,2,"{\cf2 But Iudeth saide, I may not eate of them, least there should be an offence, but I can suffice my selfe with the things that I haue brought.}"
68,12,3,"{\cf2 Then Olofernes said vnto her, If the things that thou hast, should faile, howe should we giue thee the like? for there is none with vs of thy nation.}"
68,12,4,"{\cf2 Then said Iudeth vnto him, As thy soule liueth, my lorde, thine handmaide shall not spende those things that I haue, before the Lorde worke by mine hand the things that he hath determined.}"
68,12,5,"{\cf2 Then the seruants of Olofernes brought her into the tent, and she slept vntill midnight, and rose at the morning watch,}"
68,12,6,"{\cf2 And sent to Olofernes, saying, Let my lorde commaunde that thine handmaide may goe foorth vnto prayer.}"
68,12,7,"{\cf2 Then Olofernes commanded his garde that they shoulde not stay her: thus she abode in the campe three dayes, and went out in the night into the valley of Bethulia, and washed her selfe in a fountaine, euen in the water by the campe.}"
68,12,8,"{\cf2 And when she came out, she prayed vnto the Lord God of Israel, that he woulde direct her way to the exaltation of the children of her people.}"
68,12,9,"{\cf2 So she returned, and remained pure in the tent, vntill she ate her meate at euening.}"
68,12,10,"{\cf2 And in the fourth day, Olofernes made a feast to his owne seruants only, and called none of them to the banket, that had the affaires in hande.}"
68,12,11,"{\cf2 Then saide he to Bagoas the eunuche who had charge ouer all that he had, Goe and perswade this Hebrewe woman, which is with thee, that she come vnto vs, and eate and drinke with vs.}"
68,12,12,"{\cf2 For it were a shame for vs, if we shoulde let such a woman alone, and not talke with her, and if we doe not allure her, she will mocke vs.}"
68,12,13,"{\cf2 Then went Bagoas from the presence of Olofernes, and came to her, and saide, Let not this faire maide make difficultie to goe in to my lord, and to be honoured in his presence, and to drinke wine with vs ioyfully, and to be entreated as one of the daughters of the children of Assur, which remaine in the house of Nabuchodonosor.}"
68,12,14,"{\cf2 The said Iudeth vnto him, Who am I now, that I should gainesay my lord? Surely whatsoeuer pleaseth him, I will doe speedily, and it shall be my ioy vnto the day of my death.}"
68,12,15,"{\cf2 So she arose & trimmed her with garments, and with all the ornaments of women, & her maid went, and spred foorth her skinnes on the grounde ouer against Olofernes, which she had receiued of Bagoas for her daily vse, that she might sit and eate vpon them.}"
68,12,16,"{\cf2 Nowe when Iudeth came and sate downe, Olofernes heart was rauished with her, and his spirite was moued, and he desired greatly her company: for he had waited for the time to deceiue her from the day that he had seene her.}"
68,12,17,"{\cf2 Then said Olofernes vnto her, Drinke now, and be merry with vs.}"
68,12,18,"{\cf2 So Iudeth said, I drinke nowe, my lorde, because my state is exalted this day more then euer it was since I was borne.}"
68,12,19,"{\cf2 Then she tooke, and ate and dranke before him the things, that her maide had prepared.}"
68,12,20,"{\cf2 And Olofernes reioyced because of her, and dranke much more wine then hee had drunken at any time in one day since he was borne.}"
68,13,1,"{\cf2 Now when the euening was come, his seruants made haste to depart, and Bagoas shut his tent without, and dismissed those that were present, from the presence of his lorde, and they went to their beddes: for they were all weary, because the feast had bene long.}"
68,13,2,"{\cf2 And Iudeth was left alone in the tent, and Olofernes was stretched along vpon his bed: for he was filled with wine.}"
68,13,3,"{\cf2 Nowe Iudeth had commanded her maide to stande without her chamber, and to waite for her comming foorth as she did daily: for she saide, she would go forth to her prayers, and she spake to Bagoas according to the same purpose.}"
68,13,4,"{\cf2 So all went foorth of her presence, and none was left in the chamber, neither litle nor great: then Iudeth standing by his bed, said in her heart, O Lorde God of all power, beholde at this present the workes of mine handes for the exaltation of Ierusalem.}"
68,13,5,"{\cf2 For nowe is the time to helpe thine inheritance, and to execute mine enterprises, to the destruction of the enemies which are risen against vs.}"
68,13,6,"{\cf2 Then she came to the post of the bed which was at Olofernes head, and tooke downe his fauchin from thence,}"
68,13,7,"{\cf2 And approched to the bed, and tooke holde of the heare of his head, and said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel this day.}"
68,13,8,"{\cf2 And she smote twise vpon his necke with al her might, and she tooke away his head from him,}"
68,13,9,"{\cf2 And rolled his bodie downe from the bed, and pulled downe the canopie from the pillars, and anon after she went foorth, and gaue Olofernes head to her maide,}"
68,13,10,"{\cf2 And she put it in her scrippe of meate: so they twaine went together according to their custome vnto praier, and preassing through the tents, went about by that valley, & went vp to the moutaine of Bethulia, and came to the gates thereof.}"
68,13,11,"{\cf2 Then said Iudeth afarre off to the watchmen at the gates, Open nowe the gate: God, euen our God is with vs to shewe his power yet in Ierusalem, and his force against his enemies, as he hath euen done this day.}"
68,13,12,"{\cf2 Nowe when the men of her citie heard her voyce, they made haste to goe downe to the gate of their citie, and they called the Elders of the city.}"
68,13,13,"{\cf2 And they ranne all together both small and great: for it was aboue their expectation, that she shoulde come. So they opened the gate and receiued her, and made a fire for a light, and stood roud about them twaine.}"
68,13,14,"{\cf2 Then she said to them with a loude voyce, Praise God, praise God: for he hath not taken away his mercie from the house of Israel, but hath destroyed our enemies by mine hands this night.}"
68,13,15,"{\cf2 So she tooke the head out of the scrippe and shewed it, and said vnto them, Beholde the head of Olofernes, the chiefe captaine of the armie of Assur, and beholde the canopie, wherein he did lye in his drunkennes, and the Lord hath smitteth him by the hande of a woman.}"
68,13,16,"{\cf2 As the Lorde liueth, who hath kept me in my way that I went, my countenance hath deceiued him to his destruction, and he hath not committed sinne with me by any pollution or villenie.}"
68,13,17,"{\cf2 Then all the people were wonderfully astonished, and bowed them selues, and worshipped God, and said with one accorde, Blessed be thou, O our God, which hast this day brought to nought the enemies of thy people.}"
68,13,18,"{\cf2 Then said Ozias vnto her, O daughter, blessed art thou of the most hie God aboue al the women of the earth, and blessed be the Lorde God, which hath created the heauens and the earth, which hath directed thee to the cutting off of the head of the chiefe of our enemies.}"
68,13,19,"{\cf2 Surely this thine hope shall neuer departe out of the heartes of men: for they shall remember the power of God for euer.}"
68,13,20,"{\cf2 And God turne these things to thee for a perpetuall praise, and visite thee with good things, because thou hast not spared thy life, because of the affliction of our nation, but thou hast holpen our ruine, walking a straight way before our God; all the people said, So be it, so be it.}"
68,14,1,"{\cf2 Then said Iudeth vnto them, Heare me also, my brethren, and take this head, and hang it vpon the hyest place of your walles.}"
68,14,2,"{\cf2 And so soone as the morning shall appeare and the sunne shall come foorth vpon the earth, take you euery one his weapons, and goe foorth euery valiant man out of the citie, & set you a captaine ouer them, as though you woulde goe downe into the fielde, towarde the watch of the Assyrians, but goe not downe.}"
68,14,3,"{\cf2 Then they shall take their armour, and shall goe into their campe, and rayse vp the captaines of the armie of Assur, and they shall runne to the tent of Olofernes, but shall not finde him: then feare shall fall vpon them, and they shall flee beforeyour face.}"
68,14,4,"{\cf2 So you & all that inhabite the coastes of Israel, shal pursue them, & ouerthrow them as they go.}"
68,14,5,"{\cf2 But before you doe these things, call mee Achior the Ammonite, that hee may see, and knowe him that despised the house of Israel, and that sent him to vs as to death.}"
68,14,6,"{\cf2 Then they called Achior out of the house of Ozias, and when hee was come and sawe the head of Olofernes in a certaine mans hand in the assemblie of the people, hee fell downe on his face, and his spirit failed.}"
68,14,7,"{\cf2 But when they had taken him vp, hee fell at Iudeths feete, and reuerenced her, and said, Blessed art thou in all the tabernacle of Iuda, and in al nations, which, hearing thy name, shalbe astonished.}"
68,14,8,"{\cf2 Now therefore tell mee all the thinges, that thou hast done in these dayes. Then Iudeth declared vnto him in the middes of the people all that shee had done from the daye that shee went forth, vntill that houre shee spake vnto them.}"
68,14,9,"{\cf2 And when she had left of speaking, the people reioyced with a great voyce, and made a noyse of gladnesse through their citie.}"
68,14,10,"{\cf2 And Achior, seeing all things that God had done for Israel, beleeued in God vnfaynedly, and circumcised the foreskin of his flesh, and was ioyned vnto the house of Israel vnto this day.}"
68,14,11,"{\cf2 Assoone as the morning arose, they hanged the head of Olofernes out at the wall, and euery man tooke his weapons, and they went forth by bandes vnto the straytes of the mountaine.}"
68,14,12,"{\cf2 But when the Assyrians sawe them, they sent to their captaines, which went to the gouernours and chiefe captaines, and to all their rulers.}"
68,14,13,"{\cf2 So they came to Olofernes tent and saide to him that had the charge of all his things, Waken our lord: for the slaues haue bene bolde to come downe against vs to battel, that they may bee destroyed for euer.}"
68,14,14,"{\cf2 Then went in Bagoas, and knocked at the doore of the tent: for hee thought that hee had slept with Iudeth.}"
68,14,15,"{\cf2 But because none answered, hee opened it, and went into the chamber, and founde him cast vpon the floore, and his head was taken from him.}"
68,14,16,"{\cf2 Therefore he cryed with a loude voyce, with weeping and mourning, and a mightie cry, and rent his garments.}"
68,14,17,"{\cf2 After, he went into the tent of Iudeth where she vsed to remaine, and founde her not: then hee leaped out to the people and cryed,}"
68,14,18,"{\cf2 These slaues haue committed wickednesse: one woman of the Hebrewes hath brought shame vpon the house of King Nabuchodonosor: for beholde, Olofernes lieth vpon the grounde without an head.}"
68,14,19,"{\cf2 When the captaines of the Assyrians armie hearde these words, they rent their coates, and their heart was wonderfully troubled, and there was a cry and a verie great noyse throughout the campe.}"
68,15,1,"{\cf2 And when they that were in the tentes, heard, they were astonished at the thing that was done.}"
68,15,2,"{\cf2 And feare and trembling fell vpon them, so that there was no man that durst abide in the sight of his neighbour: but altogether amased, they fled by euery way of the plaine and of the mountaines.}"
68,15,3,"{\cf2 They also that had camped in the mountaines rounde about Bethulia, were put to flight: then the children of Israel, euery one that was a warriour among them, rushed out vpon them.}"
68,15,4,"{\cf2 Then sent Ozias to Bethomasthem, and to Bebai, and Chobai, and Chola and to al the coastes of Israel, such as shoulde declare vnto them the things that were done, and that all shoulde rushe forth vpon their enemies to destroy them.}"
68,15,5,"{\cf2 Nowe when the children of Israel heard it, they all fell vpon them together vnto Choba: likewise also they that came from Ierusalem and from all the mountaines: for men had tolde them what things were done in the campe of their enemies, & they that were in Galaad and in Galile chased them with a great slaughter vntill they came to Damascus and to the coastes thereof.}"
68,15,6,"{\cf2 And the residue that dwelt at Bethulia, fell vpon the campe of Assur and spoyled them, and were greatly enriched.}"
68,15,7,"{\cf2 And the children of Israel that returned from the slaughter, had the rest: and the villages and the cities that were in the mountaines and in the plaine, had a great bootie: for the abundance was very great.}"
68,15,8,"{\cf2 Then Ioacim the hie Priest, and the Ancients of the children of Israel that dwelt in Ierusalem, came to confirme the benefites that God had shewed to Israel, and to see Iudeth, and to salute her.}"
68,15,9,"{\cf2 And when they came vnto her, they blessed her with one accord, and saide vnto her, Thou art the exaltation of Ierusalem: thou art the great glorie of Israel: thou art the great reioycing of our nation.}"
68,15,10,"{\cf2 Thou hast done all these thinges by thine hande: thou hast done much good to Israel, and God is pleased therewith: blessed bee thou of the almightie Lorde for euermore: and all the people said, So be it.}"
68,15,11,"{\cf2 And the people spoyled the campe the space of thirtie dayes, and they gaue vnto Iudeth Olofernes tent, and all his siluer and beds, and basins, and all his stuffe, and she tooke it and laid it on her mules, and made readie her charets, & laied them thereon.}"
68,15,12,"{\cf2 Then all the women of Israel came together to see her, & blessed her, & made a daunce among them for her, and she tooke braunches in her hand, and gaue also to the women that were with her.}"
68,15,13,"{\cf2 They also crowned her with oliues, and her that was with her, and shee went before the people in the daunce, leading al the women: and all the men of Israel followed in their armour, with crownes, and with songs in their mouthes.}"
68,16,1,"{\cf2 Then Iudeth began this confession in all Israel, and all the people sang this songe with a loude voyce.}"
68,16,2,"{\cf2 And Iudeth saide, Beginne vnto my GOD with tymbrels: sing to my Lorde with cymbals: tune vnto him a psalme: exalt his prayse, and call vpon his Name.}"
68,16,3,"{\cf2 For God breaketh the battels, and pitched his campe in the middes of the people, and deliuered me out of the hande of the persecuters.}"
68,16,4,"{\cf2 Assur came from the mountaines forth of the North: hee came with thousandes in his armie, whose multitude hath shut vp the riuers and their horsemen haue couered the valleis.}"
68,16,5,"{\cf2 He said that he would burne vp my borders and kill my yong men with the sworde, and dash the sucking children against the ground, and make mine infantes as a pray, and my virgins a spoyle.}"
68,16,6,"{\cf2 But the almightie Lorde hath brought them to nought by the hand of a woman.}"
68,16,7,"{\cf2 For the mightie did not fal by the yong men, neither did the sonnes of Titan smite him, nor the hie giants inuade him, but Iudeth the daughter of Merari did discomfite him by the beautie of her countenance.}"
68,16,8,"{\cf2 For shee put off the garment of her widowhoode, for the exaltation of those that were oppressed in Israel, and anointed her face with oyntment, and bound vp her heare in a coife, and tooke a linnen garment to deceiue him.}"
68,16,9,"{\cf2 Her slippers rauished his eyes: her beautie tooke his minde prisoner, and the fauchin passed through his necke.}"
68,16,10,"{\cf2 The Persians were astonished at her boldenes, & the Medes were troubled with her hardines.}"
68,16,11,"{\cf2 But mine afflicted reioyced, and my feeble ones showted: then they feared, they lifted vp their voyce and turned backe.}"
68,16,12,"{\cf2 The children of maides perced them, and wounded them as they fledde away like children: they perished by the battel of the Lord.}"
68,16,13,"{\cf2 I will sing vnto the Lorde a song and praise, O Lord, thou art great and glorious, marueilous & inuincible in power.}"
68,16,14,"{\cf2 Let all thy creatures serue thee: for thou hast spoken and they were made: thou hast sent thy Spirit, and he made them vp: and there is none that can resist thy voyce.}"
68,16,15,"{\cf2 For the mountaines leape vp from their foudations with the waters: the rockes melte at thy presence like waxe: yet thou art mercifull to them that feare thee.}"
68,16,16,"{\cf2 For al sacrifice is to litle for a sweet savour, and al the fatte is to litle for thy burnt offring: but hee that feareth the Lorde, is great at all times.}"
68,16,17,"{\cf2 Woe to the nations that rise vp against my kinred: the Lorde almightie will take vengeance of them in the day of iudgement, in sending fire & wormes vpon their flesh, and they shall feele them and weepe for euer.}"
68,16,18,"{\cf2 After, when they wet vnto Ierusalem, they worshipped the Lorde, and assoone as the people were purified, they offred their burnt offrings, and their free offringes, and their giftes.}"
68,16,19,"{\cf2 Iudeth also offred all the stuffe of Olofernes, which the people had giuen her, and gaue the canopie which she had taken off his bed, for an oblation to the Lord.}"
68,16,20,"{\cf2 So the people reioyced in Ierusalem by the Sanctuarie, for the space of three moneths, and Iudeth remained with them.}"
68,16,21,"{\cf2 After this time, euery one returned to his owne inheritance, and Iudeth went to Bethulia, and remayned in her owne possession, and was for her time honourable in all the countrey.}"
68,16,22,"{\cf2 And many desired her, but none had her companie all the dayes of her life after that Manasses her husband was dead, and was gathered to his people.}"
68,16,23,"{\cf2 But shee increased more and more in honour, and waxed olde in her husbandes house, beeing an hundreth and fiue yeere olde, and made her maide free: so shee dyed in Bethulia, and they buried her in the graue of her husband Manasses.}"
68,16,24,"{\cf2 And the house of Israel lamented her seuen dayes, and before shee dyed, shee did distribute her goods to all them that were neerest of kinred to Manasses her husband, and to them that were the neerest of her kinred.}"
68,16,25,"{\cf2 And there was none that made the children of Israel any more afrayde in the dayes of Iudeth, nor a long time after her death.}"
69,1,1,"{\cf2 Love righteousnesse, ye that be Iudges of the earth: thinke reuerently of the Lord, and seeke him in simplicitie of heart.}"
69,1,2,"{\cf2 For he wil be found of them that tempt him not, and appeareth vnto such as be not vnfaithfull vnto him.}"
69,1,3,"{\cf2 For wicked thoughts separate from God: and his power when it is tried, reprooueth the vnwise,}"
69,1,4,"{\cf2 Because wisdome cannot enter into a wicked heart, nor dwell in the body that is subiect vnto sinne.}"
69,1,5,"{\cf2 For the holy Spirit of discipline fleeth from deceite, & withdraweth himselfe from the thoughts that are without vnderstanding, and is rebuked when wickednes commeth.}"
69,1,6,"{\cf2 For the Spirit of wisdome is louing, and wil not absolue him, that blasphemeth with his lips: for God is a witnes of his reines, and a true beholder of his heart, and an hearer of the tongue.}"
69,1,7,"{\cf2 For the Spirite of the Lorde filleth all the world: and the same that mainteineth all things, hath knowledge of the voyce.}"
69,1,8,"{\cf2 Therefore hee that speaketh vnrighteous things, cannot be hid: neither shall the iudgement of reproche let him escape.}"
69,1,9,"{\cf2 For inquisition shalbe made for the thoughts of the vngodly, and the sound of his wordes shall come vnto God for the correction of his iniquities.}"
69,1,10,"{\cf2 For the eare of ielousie heareth al things, and the noyse of the grudgings shall not be hid.}"
69,1,11,"{\cf2 Therefore beware of murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and refraine your tongue from slander: for there is no worde so secret, that shal go for nought, and the mouth that speaketh lyes, slayeth the soule.}"
69,1,12,"{\cf2 Seeke not death in the errour of your life: destroy not your selues thorowe the workes of your owne hands.}"
69,1,13,"{\cf2 For God hath not made death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the liuing.}"
69,1,14,"{\cf2 For he created all things, that they might haue their being: and the generations of the world are preserued, and there is no poyson of destruction in them, & the kingdome of hell is not vpon earth.}"
69,1,15,"{\cf2 For righteousnes is immortall, but vnrighteousnes bringeth death.}"
69,1,16,"{\cf2 And the vngodly call it vnto them both with hands and wordes: and while they thinke to haue a friend of it, they come to naught: for they are confederate with it: therefore are they worthy to be partakers thereof.}"
69,2,1,"{\cf2 For the vngodly say, as they falsly imagine with themselues, Our life is short & tedious: and in the death of a man there is no recouerie, neither was any knowen that hath returned from the graue.}"
69,2,2,"{\cf2 For we are borne at all aduenture, and we shall be hereafter as though we had neuer bene: for the breath is a smoke in our nostrels, & the wordes as a sparke raised out of our heart,}"
69,2,3,"{\cf2 Which being extinguished, the body is turned into ashes, and the Spirite vanisheth as the soft ayre.}"
69,2,4,"{\cf2 Our life shall passe away as the trace of a cloude, and come to naught as the miste that is driuen away with the beames of the sunne, and cast downe with the heate thereof. Our name also shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall haue our workes in remembrance.}"
69,2,5,"{\cf2 For our time is as a shadow that passeth away, and after our ende there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man commeth againe.}"
69,2,6,"{\cf2 Come therefore, and let vs enioy the pleasures, that are present, and let vs cheerefully vse the creatures as in youth.}"
69,2,7,"{\cf2 Let vs fill our selues with costly wine & ointments, & let not the floure of life passe by vs.}"
69,2,8,"{\cf2 Let vs crowne our selues with rose buds afore they be withered.}"
69,2,9,"{\cf2 Let vs all be partakers of our wantonnes: let vs leaue some token of our pleasure in euery place: for that is our portion, and this is our lot.}"
69,2,10,"{\cf2 Let vs oppresse the poore that is righteous: let vs not spare the widdow, nor reuerence ye white heares of the aged, that haue liued many yeeres.}"
69,2,11,"{\cf2 Let our strength be the lawe of vnrighteousnes: for the thing that is feeble, is reprooued as vnprofitable.}"
69,2,12,"{\cf2 Therefore let vs defraude the righteous: for he is not for our profite, and he is contrary to our doings: hee checketh vs for offending against the Law, and blameth vs as transgressers of discipline.}"
69,2,13,"{\cf2 He maketh his boast to haue the knowledge of God: & he calleth himselfe the sonne of ye Lord.}"
69,2,14,"{\cf2 He is made to reprooue our thoughtes.}"
69,2,15,"{\cf2 It grieueth vs also to looke vpon him: for his life is not like other mens: his wayes are of another fashion.}"
69,2,16,"{\cf2 He counteth vs as bastards, and hee withdraweth himselfe from our wayes as from filthines: he commendeth greatly the latter end of the iust, and boasteth that God is his father.}"
69,2,17,"{\cf2 Let vs see then if his wordes be true: let vs prooue what ende he shall haue.}"
69,2,18,"{\cf2 For if the righteous man be the sonne of God, hee wil helpe him, and deliuer him from the hands of his enemies.}"
69,2,19,"{\cf2 Let vs examine him with rebukes and torments that we may know his meekenes, & prooue his patience.}"
69,2,20,"{\cf2 Let vs condemne him vnto a shamefull death: for he shalbe preserued as he himselfe sayth.}"
69,2,21,"{\cf2 Such things doe they imagine, and go astray: for their owne wickednes hath blinded them.}"
69,2,22,"{\cf2 And they doe not vnderstand the mysteries of God, neither hope for the reward of righteousnes, nor can discerne the honour of the soules that are faultles.}"
69,2,23,"{\cf2 For God created man without corruption, and made him after the image of his owne likenes.}"
69,2,24,"{\cf2 Neuertheles, thorowe enuie of the deuill came death into the world: and they that holde of his side, prooue it.}"
69,3,1,"{\cf2 Bvt the soules of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment shall touch them.}"
69,3,2,"{\cf2 In the sight of the vnwise they appeared to die, and their end was thought grieuous,}"
69,3,3,"{\cf2 And their departing from vs, destruction, but they are in peace.}"
69,3,4,"{\cf2 And though they suffer paine before men, yet is their hope full of immortalitie.}"
69,3,5,"{\cf2 They are punished, but in fewe things, yet in many things shal they be wel rewarded: for God proueth them, & findeth them meete for him selfe.}"
69,3,6,"{\cf2 He tryeth them as the golde in the fornace, and receiueth them as a perfect fruite offering.}"
69,3,7,"{\cf2 And in the time of their vision they shall shine, and runne thorowe as the sparks among the stubble.}"
69,3,8,"{\cf2 They shall iudge the nations, and haue dominion ouer the people, and their Lord shal reigne for euer.}"
69,3,9,"{\cf2 They that trust in him shall vnderstand the trueth, and the faythfull shall remaine with him in loue: for grace and mercy is among his Saints, and he regardeth his elect.}"
69,3,10,"{\cf2 But the vngodly shalbe punished according to their imaginations: for they haue despised the righteous, and forsaken the Lord.}"
69,3,11,"{\cf2 Who so despiseth wisdome and discipline, is miserable, and their hope is vaine, and their labours are foolish, and their workes vnprofitable:}"
69,3,12,"{\cf2 Their wiues are vndiscreete, and their children wicked: their offering is cursed.}"
69,3,13,"{\cf2 Therefore the barren is blessed which is vndefiled, and knoweth not the sinfull bed: she shal haue fruite in the visitation of the soules,}"

69,4,3,"{\cf2 But the multitude of the vngodly which abound in children, is vnprofitable: and the bastard plants shall take no deepe roote, nor lay any fast foundation.}"
69,4,4,"{\cf2 For though they bud foorth in the branches for a time, yet they shalbe shaken with the winde: for they stand not fast, and through the vehemencie of the winde they shalbe rooted out.}"

69,4,6,"{\cf2 For all the children that are borne of the wicked bed, shalbe witnes of the wickednes against their parents when they be asked.}"
69,4,7,"{\cf2 But though the righteous be preuented with death, yet shall he be in rest.}"
69,4,8,"{\cf2 For the honourable age is not that which is of long time, neither that which is measured by the number of yeeres.}"

69,4,10,"{\cf2 He pleased God, and was beloued of him, so that where as he liued among sinners, he translated him.}"
69,4,11,"{\cf2 He was taken away, least wickednesse shouldalter his vnderstanding, or deceit beguile his minde.}"
69,4,12,"{\cf2 For wickednes by bewitching obscureth the thinges that are good, and the vnstedfastnesse of concupiscence peruerteth the simple minde.}"
69,4,13,"{\cf2 Though he was soone dead, yet fulfilled hee much time.}"
69,4,14,"{\cf2 For his soule pleased God: therefore hasted he to take him away from wickednes.}"

69,4,20,"{\cf2 So they being afraide, shall remember their sinnes, and their owne wickednes shall come before them to conuince them.}"

69,5,9,"{\cf2 All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a poste that passeth bye}"
69,5,10,"{\cf2 As a ship that passeth ouer the waues of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neither ye path of it in the floods:}"
69,5,11,"{\cf2 Or as a birde that flieth thorow in the ayre, and no man can see any token of her passage, but onely heare the noise of her wings beating the light winde, parting the aire through the vehemencie of her going, and fleeth on shaking her wings, whereas afterward no token of her way can be found:}"

69,5,15,"{\cf2 But the righteous shall liue for euer: their rewarde also is with the Lord, and the most High hath care of them.}"
69,5,16,"{\cf2 Therefore shall they receiue a glorious kingdome, and a beautifull crowne of the Lordes hande: for with his right hande shall hee couer them, and with his arme shall he defende them.}"
69,5,17,"{\cf2 He shal take his ielousie for armour, and shall arme the creatures to be reuenged of the enemies.}"
69,5,18,"{\cf2 He shall put on righteousnes for a brestplate, and take true iudgement in steade of an helmet.}"

69,6,3,"{\cf2 For the rule is giuen you of the Lorde, and power by the most High, which wil try your works, and search out your imaginations.}"
69,6,4,"{\cf2 Because that ye being officers of his kingdome haue not iudged aright, nor kept the Lawe, nor walked after the will of God,}"

69,7,4,"{\cf2 I was nourished in swadling cloths, and with cares.}"
69,7,5,"{\cf2 For there is no King that had any other beginning of birth.}"
69,7,6,"{\cf2 All men then haue one entrance vnto life, and a like going out.}"
69,7,7,"{\cf2 Wherefore I prayed, and vnderstanding was giuen mee: I called, and the spirit of wisdome came vnto me.}"
69,7,8,"{\cf2 I preferred her to scepters and thrones, and counted riches nothing in comparison of her.}"
69,7,9,"{\cf2 Neither did I compare precious stones vnto her: for all gold is but a litle grauel in respect of her, and siluer shalbe counted but clay before her.}"
69,7,10,"{\cf2 I loued her aboue health and beautie, and purposed to take her for my light: for her light cannot be quenched.}"
69,7,11,"{\cf2 All good things therefore came to me together with her, & innumerable riches thorow her hands.}"
69,7,12,"{\cf2 So I was glad in all: for wisdome was the author thereof, and I knewe not that she was the mother of these things.}"
69,7,13,"{\cf2 And I learned vnfainedly, and communicated without enuie, and I do not hide her riches.}"
69,7,14,"{\cf2 For she is an infinite treasure vnto men, which who so vse, become partakers of the loue of God, and are accepted for the giftes of knowledge.}"
69,7,15,"{\cf2 God hath graunted me to speake according to my minde, and to iudge worthily of the thinges, that are giuen me: for he is the leader vnto wisdome, and the directer of the wise.}"
69,7,16,"{\cf2 For in his hand are both we and our wordes, and all wisdome, and the knowledge of the workes.}"
69,7,17,"{\cf2 For he hath giuen me the true knowledge of the things that are, so that I knowe how the worlde was made, and the powers of the elements,}"
69,7,18,"{\cf2 The beginning & the end, and the mids of the times: how the times alter, & the change of ye seasons,}"
69,7,19,"{\cf2 The course of ye yere, the situatio of the starres,}"

69,7,21,"{\cf2 And all things both secret and knowen doe I knowe: for wisdome the worker of all things, hath taught me it.}"
69,7,22,"{\cf2 For in her is the Spirit of vnderstading, which is holy, ye only begotten, manifold, subtil, moueable, cleare, vndefiled, euident, not hurtfull, louing the good, sharpe, which cannot be letted, doing good,}"
69,7,23,"{\cf2 Courteous, stable, sure, without care, hauing all power, circumspect in all thinges, and passing through all, intellectuall, pure and subtil spirites.}"
69,7,24,"{\cf2 For wisdom is nimbler then all nimble things: she goeth thorowe and atteineth to all thinges, because of her purenesse.}"
69,7,25,"{\cf2 For she is the breth of the power of God, & a pure influence that floweth fro the glory of the Almighty: therfore can no defiled thing come vnto her.}"
69,7,26,"{\cf2 For she is the brightnesse of the euerlasting light, the vndefiled mirrour of the maiestie of God, and the image of his goodnesse.}"
69,7,27,"{\cf2 And being one, she can do all things, and remayning in her selfe, renueth all, and according to the ages shee entreth into the holy soules, and maketh them the friendes of God and Prophets.}"
69,7,28,"{\cf2 For God loueth none, if he dwel not with wisdom.}"
69,7,29,"{\cf2 For she is more beautifull then the sunne, and is aboue all the order of the starres, and the light is not to be compared vnto her.}"
69,7,30,"{\cf2 For night commeth vpon it, but wickednesse cannot ouercome wisdome.}"
69,8,1,"{\cf2 She also reacheth from one end to another mightily, and comely doeth she order all things.}"
69,8,2,"{\cf2 I haue loued her, & sought her fro my youth: I desired to marry her, such loue had I vnto her beauty.}"
69,8,3,"{\cf2 In that she is conuersant with God, it comendeth her nobilitie: yea, the Lord of all things loueth her.}"
69,8,4,"{\cf2 For she is the scholemystres of the knowledge of God, and the choser out of his workes.}"
69,8,5,"{\cf2 If riches be a possessio to be desired in this life, what is richer then wisdom, that worketh all things?}"
69,8,6,"{\cf2 For if prudencie worketh, what is it among all things, that worketh better then she?}"
69,8,7,"{\cf2 If a man loue righteousnes, her labours are vertuous: for she teacheth sobernes and prudencie, righteousnes and strength, which are the most profitable things that men can haue in this life.}"
69,8,8,"{\cf2 If a man desire great experience, she can tell the things that are past, & discerne things to come: she knoweth the subtilties of wordes, and the solution of darke sentences: she foreseeth the signes and wonders, or euer they come to passe, and the successe of seasons and times.}"
69,8,9,"{\cf2 Therefore I purposed to take her vnto my companie, knowing that shee would counsell mee good things, and comfort me in cares and griefes.}"
69,8,10,"{\cf2 For her sake shall I haue glorie among the multitude, and honour among the Elders though I be yong.}"
69,8,11,"{\cf2 I shalbe founde of sharpe iudgement, so that I shalbe marueilous in the sight of great men.}"
69,8,12,"{\cf2 When I hold my tongue, they shall abide my leysure: when I speake, they shall heare diligently,and if I talke much, they shall lay their hands vpon their mouth.}"
69,8,13,"{\cf2 Moreouer, by her I shall obtaine immortalitie, & leaue an euerlasting memoriall among them that come after me.}"
69,8,14,"{\cf2 I shall gouerne the people, and the nations shalbe subdued vnto me.}"
69,8,15,"{\cf2 Horrible tyrants shalbe afraide when they heare me: among the multitude I shalbe counted good, and mightie in battell.}"
69,8,16,"{\cf2 When I come home, I shall rest with her: for her company hath no bitternes, and her felowship hath no tediousnes, but mirth and ioy.}"
69,8,17,"{\cf2 Now when I considered these things by my selfe, and pondred them in mine heart, how that to be ioyned vnto wisdome is immortalitie,}"
69,8,18,"{\cf2 And great pleasure is in her friendship, and that in the workes of her hands are infinite riches, and that in the exercise of talking with her is prudencie, and glory by communing with her, I went about, seeking how I might take her vnto me.}"
69,8,19,"{\cf2 For I was a wittie childe, and was of a good spirite.}"
69,8,20,"{\cf2 Yea, rather being good, I came to an vndefiled body.}"
69,8,21,"{\cf2 Neuertheles, when I perceiued that I could not enioy her, except God gaue her (and that was a point of wisdome also, to know whose gift it was) I went vnto the Lord, and besought him, and with my whole heart I sayd,}"
69,9,1,"{\cf2 O God of Fathers, and Lorde of mercy, which hast made all things with thy worde,}"
69,9,2,"{\cf2 And ordeined man through thy wisdome, that he should haue dominion ouer the creatures which thou hast made,}"
69,9,3,"{\cf2 And gouerne the world according to equitie and righteousnes, and execute iudgement with an vpright heart.}"
69,9,4,"{\cf2 Giue me that wisdome, which sitteth by thy throne, & put me not out from among thy childre.}"
69,9,5,"{\cf2 For I thy seruant, & sonne of thine handmayd, am a feeble person, & of a short time, and yet lesse in ye vnderstanding of iudgement & the lawes.}"
69,9,6,"{\cf2 And though a man be neuer so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdome be not with him, he shalbe nothing regarded.}"
69,9,7,"{\cf2 Thou hast chosen me to be a King of thy people, and the iudge of thy sonnes and daughters.}"
69,9,8,"{\cf2 Thou hast commanded me to build a temple vpon thine holy Mount, & an altar in ye citie wherein thou dwellest, a likenes of thine holy Tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning,}"
69,9,9,"{\cf2 And thy wisdome with thee, which knoweth thy workes, which also was when thou madest the world, and which knew what was acceptable in thy sight, and right in thy commandements.}"
69,9,10,"{\cf2 Send her out of thine holy heauens, & send her from the throne of thy maiestie, that she may be with me, and labour, that I may knowe what is acceptable in thy sight.}"
69,9,11,"{\cf2 For she knoweth & vnderstandeth al things, and she shall leade me soberly in my workes and preserue me by her glory.}"
69,9,12,"{\cf2 So shall my workes be acceptable, and then shall I gouerne thy people righteously, & be meete for my fathers throne.}"
69,9,13,"{\cf2 For what man is he that can know ye counsel of God? or who can thinke what the wil of God is?}"
69,9,14,"{\cf2 For the thoughtes of mortall men are fearefull, and our forecastes are vncertaine,}"
69,9,15,"{\cf2 Because a corruptible body is heauy vnto the soule, and the earthly mansion keepeth downe the minde that is full of cares.}"
69,9,16,"{\cf2 And hardly can we discerne the things that are vpon earth, and with great labour finde we out the things which are before vs: who can then seeke out the things that are in heauen?}"
69,9,17,"{\cf2 Who can knowe thy counsell, except thou giue him wisdome, and send thine holy Spirit from aboue?}"
69,9,18,"{\cf2 For so the wayes of them which are vpon earth, are reformed, and men are taught the things that are pleasant vnto thee, and are preserued through wisdome.}"
69,10,1,"{\cf2 She preserued the first father of the world, that was formed, and kept him when he was created alone, and brought him out of his offence,}"
69,10,2,"{\cf2 And gaue him power to rule all things,}"
69,10,3,"{\cf2 But the vnrighteous in his wrath departed from her, and perished by killing his brother in his furie.}"

69,10,5,"{\cf2 Moreouer, when the nations were ioyned in their malicious confederacies, she knew the righteous, & preserued him faultles vnto God, and kept him sure, because she loued him tenderly as a sonne.}"
69,10,6,"{\cf2 She preserued the righteous, when the vngodly perished, when he fled from the fire that fell downe vpon the fiue cities.}"
69,10,7,"{\cf2 Of whose wickednes the waste land that smoketh, yet giueth testimonie, and the trees that beare fruite that neuer commeth to ripenes: and for a remembrance of the vnfaithfull soule, there standeth a pillar of salte.}"
69,10,8,"{\cf2 For al such as regarded not wisdome, had not only this hurt, that they knew not the things which were good, but also left behinde them vnto men a memoriall of their foolishnes, so that in the things wherein they sinned, they can not lie hid.}"
69,10,9,"{\cf2 But wisdome deliuered them that serued her.}"
69,10,10,"{\cf2 When the righteous fled because of his brothers wrath, she led him the right way, shewed him the kingdome of God, gaue him knowledge of holy things, made him rich in his labours, and made his paines profitable.}"
69,10,11,"{\cf2 Against the couetousnes of such as defrauded him, she stood by him and made him rich.}"
69,10,12,"{\cf2 She saued him from the enemies, & defended him from them, that lay in waite, & she gaue him the price in a mightie battell, that he might know that the feare of God is stronger then all things.}"
69,10,13,"{\cf2 When the righteous was solde, she forsooke him not, but deliuered him from sinne: she went downe with him into the dungeon,}"
69,10,14,"{\cf2 And failed him not in the bands, till she had brought him the scepter of the realme, and power against those that oppressed him, and them that had accused him, she declared to be liars, and gaue him perpetuall glory.}"
69,10,15,"{\cf2 She deliuered the righteous people & faultles seede from the nations that oppressed them.}"
69,10,16,"{\cf2 She entred into the soule of the seruant of the Lord, and stood by him in wonders & signes against the terrible Kings.}"
69,10,17,"{\cf2 She gaue the Saints the rewarde of their labours, and led them foorth a marueilous way: on the day time she was a shadowe vnto them, and a light of starres in the night.}"
69,10,18,"{\cf2 She brought them thorow the red sea, and caried them through the great water:}"
69,10,19,"{\cf2 But she drowned their enemies, & brought them out of the bottome of the deepe.}"
69,10,20,"{\cf2 So the righteous tooke the spoyles of the vngodly, and praysed thine holy Name, O Lord, and magnified thy victorious hand with one accord.}"
69,10,21,"{\cf2 For wisdome openeth the mouth of the dombe, and maketh the tongues of babes eloquent.}"
69,11,1,"{\cf2 She prospered their workes in the hands of thine holy Prophet.}"
69,11,2,"{\cf2 They went through the wildernes that was not inhabited, and pitched their tentes in places where there lay no way.}"
69,11,3,"{\cf2 They stoode against their enemies, and were auenged of their aduersaries.}"
69,11,4,"{\cf2 When they were thirstie, they called vpon thee, & water was giuen them out of the hie rocke, and their thirst was quenched out of ye hard stone.}"
69,11,5,"{\cf2 For by the thinges whereby their enemies were punished, by the same were the Israelites helped in their neede.}"
69,11,6,"{\cf2 For in steade of a fountaine of running water, the enemies were troubled at the corrupt blood, which was to rebuke the commandement of the killing of the children, but thou gauest vnto thine owne abundance of water vnlooked for,}"
69,11,7,"{\cf2 Declaring by the thirst that was at that time how thou haddest punished thine aduersaries.}"
69,11,8,"{\cf2 For when they were tried and chastised with mercy, they knewe howe the vngodly were iudged and punished in wrath.}"
69,11,9,"{\cf2 For these hast thou exhorted as a father, and proued them: but thou hast condemned ye other as a righteous King, when thou didst examine them.}"
69,11,10,"{\cf2 Whether they were absent or present, their punishment was alike: for their griefe was double with mourning, & the remembrance of things past.}"
69,11,11,"{\cf2 For when they perceiued that through their torments good came vnto them, they felt the Lord.}"
69,11,12,"{\cf2 And seeing the things that came to passe, at the last they wondered at him, whom afore they had cast out, denyed and derided: for they had an other thirst then the iust.}"
69,11,13,"{\cf2 Because of the foolish deuices of their wickednes wherewith they were deceiued, & worshipped serpents, that had not the vse of reason, and vile beasts, thou sendedst a multitude of vnreasonable beasts vpon them for a vengeance, that they might know, that wherewith a man sinneth, by the same also shall he be punished.}"
69,11,14,"{\cf2 For vnto thine almightie hande, that made the world of naught, it was not vnpossible to send among them a multitude of beares, or fierce lyons,}"
69,11,15,"{\cf2 Or furious beasts newly created, & vnknowen which should breathe out blastes of fire, & cast out smoke as a tempest, or shoote horrible sparkes like lightnings out of their eyes.}"

69,11,17,"{\cf2 Yea, without these might they haue bene cast downe with one winde, being persecuted by thy vengeance, and scattered abroad through the power of thy Spirite: but thou hast ordered all things in measure, number and weight.}"
69,11,18,"{\cf2 For thou hast euer had great strength and might, and who can withstande the power of thine arme!}"
69,11,19,"{\cf2 For as the small thing that ye balances weigheth, so is the world before thee, and as a drop of the morning dewe, that falleth downe vpon the earth.}"
69,11,20,"{\cf2 But thou hast mercie vpon all for thou hast power of al things, & makest as though thou sawest not the sinnes of men, because they should amend.}"
69,11,21,"{\cf2 For thou louest all things that are, & hatest none of them whome thou hast made: for thou wouldest haue created nothing that thou hadst hated.}"
69,11,22,"{\cf2 And how might any thing endure, if it were not thy will? or how could any thing be preserued, except it were called of thee?}"
69,11,23,"{\cf2 But thou sparest all: for they are thine, O Lord, which art the louer of soules.}"
69,12,1,"{\cf2 For thine incorruptible spirit is in all things.}"
69,12,2,"{\cf2 Therfore thou chastenest them measurably that go wrong, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance of the things wherein they haue offended, that leauing wickednes, they may beleeue in thee, O Lord.}"
69,12,3,"{\cf2 As for those olde inhabitants of the holy land, thou diddest hate them.}"
69,12,4,"{\cf2 For they committed abominable workes, as sorceries and wicked sacrifices,}"
69,12,5,"{\cf2 And slaying of their owne children without mercy, & eating of ye bowels of mans flesh in banketing, where ye raging Priests shed abominable blood.}"
69,12,6,"{\cf2 And the fathers were the chiefe murtherers of the soules, destitute of all helpe, whome thou wouldest destroy by the hands of our fathers,}"
69,12,7,"{\cf2 That the land which thou louest aboue all other, might be a meete dwelling for the children of God.}"
69,12,8,"{\cf2 Neuertheles, thou sparedst them also as men, and sendedst the forerunners of thine hoste, euen hornets to destroy them by litle and litle,}"
69,12,9,"{\cf2 Not that thou wast vnable to subdue the vngodly vnto ye righteous in battel, or with cruell beasts, or with one rough word to destroy them together.}"
69,12,10,"{\cf2 But in punishing them by litle and litle, thou gauest them space to repent, knowing well, that it was an vnrighteous nation & wicked of nature, and that their thought could neuer be altered.}"
69,12,11,"{\cf2 For it was a cursed seede from the beginning: yet hast thou not spared them when they sinned, because thou fearedst any man.}"
69,12,12,"{\cf2 For who dare say, What hast thou done? Or who dare stand against thy iudgement? Or who dare accuse thee for the nations that perish, whome thou hast made? Or who dare stand against thee to reuenge the wicked men?}"
69,12,13,"{\cf2 For there is none other God but thou, that carest for all things, that thou mayest declare how that thy iudgement is not vnright.}"
69,12,14,"{\cf2 There dare neither King nor tyrant in thy sight require accounts of them whome thou hast punished.}"
69,12,15,"{\cf2 For so much then as thou are righteous thy selfe, thou orderest all things righteously, thinking it not agreeable to thy power to condemne him, that hath not deserued to be punished.}"
69,12,16,"{\cf2 For thy power is the beginning of righteousnesse, and because thou art Lorde of all things, it causeth thee to spare all things.}"
69,12,17,"{\cf2 When men thinke thee not to be of a perfit power, thou declarest thy power, and reprouest the boldnesse of the wise.}"
69,12,18,"{\cf2 But thou ruling the power, iudgest with equitie, and gouernest vs with great fauour: for thou maist shewe thy power when thou wilt.}"
69,12,19,"{\cf2 By such workes nowe hast thou taught thy people, that a man should be iust and louing, and hast made thy children to be of a good hope: for thou giuest repentance to sinners.}"
69,12,20,"{\cf2 For if thou hast punished the enemies of thy children that had deserued death with so great consideration, & requesting vnto them, giuing them time & place that they might change fro their wickednesse,}"
69,12,21,"{\cf2 With howe great circumspection wilt thou punish thine owne childre, vnto whose fathers thou hast sworne and made couenants of good promises?}"
69,12,22,"{\cf2 So when thou doest chasten vs, thou punishest our enemies a thousand times more, to the intent that when we iudge, we shoulde diligently consider thy goodnesse, and when we are iudged, we shoulde hope for mercie.}"
69,12,23,"{\cf2 Wherfore thou hast tormented ye wicked that haue liued a dissolute life by their own imaginatios.}"
69,12,24,"{\cf2 For they went astray very farre in the wayes of errour, and esteemed the beastes, which their enemies despised, for gods, being abused after the maner of children, that haue none vnderstanding.}"
69,12,25,"{\cf2 Therefore hast thou sent this punishment that they should be in derisio as childre without reason.}"
69,12,26,"{\cf2 But they that will not be reformed by those scornefull rebukes, shall feele the worthie punishment of God.}"
69,12,27,"{\cf2 For in those things when they suffered, they disdained, but in these whom they counted godly, when they sawe themselues punished by them, they all acknowledged the true God whom afore they had denied to knowe: therefore came extreme damnation vpon them.}"
69,13,1,"{\cf2 Svrely all men are vaine by nature, and are ignorant of God, and could not knowe him that is, by the good things that are seene, neither consider by the workes, the worke master.}"
69,13,2,"{\cf2 But they thought the fire, or the winde or the swift aire, or the course of the starres, or the raging water, or the lightes of heauen to be gouernours of the world, and gods.}"
69,13,3,"{\cf2 Though they had such pleasure in their beautie that they thought them gods, yet shoulde they haue knowen, howe much more excellent he is that made them: for the first authour of beautie hath created these things.}"
69,13,4,"{\cf2 Or if they marueiled at the power, and operation of the, yet should they haue perceiued thereby, howe much he that made these things, is mightier.}"
69,13,5,"{\cf2 For by the greatnesse of their beautie, and of the creatures, the Creator being compared with them, may be considered.}"
69,13,6,"{\cf2 But yet ye blame is lesse in these, that seeke God and would finde him, & yet peraduenture doe erre.}"
69,13,7,"{\cf2 For they goe about by his workes to seeke him, and are perswaded by the sight, because the things are beautifull that are seene.}"
69,13,8,"{\cf2 Howbeit they are not to be excused.}"
69,13,9,"{\cf2 For if they can know so much, that they can discerne the worlde, why doe they not rather finde out the Lord thereof?}"
69,13,10,"{\cf2 But miserable are they, and among the dead is their hope, that call them gods, which are the workes of mens hands, golde, and siluer, & the thing that is inuented by arte, & the similitude of beastes, or any vaine stone that hath bene made by the hand of antiquitie.}"
69,13,11,"{\cf2 Or as when a carpenter cutteth downe a tree meete for the worke, and pareth off all ye barke thereof cunningly, & by arte maketh a vessell profitable for the vse of life.}"
69,13,12,"{\cf2 And the things that are cut off from his worke, he bestoweth to dresse his meate to fill himselfe,}"
69,13,13,"{\cf2 And that which is left of these things, which is profitable for nothing (for it is a crooked piece of wood and full of knobbes) he carueth it diligently at his leasure, and according as he is expert in cunning, he giueth it a proportion, and facioneth it after the similitude of a man,}"
69,13,14,"{\cf2 Or maketh it like some vile beast, and straketh it ouer with red, and painteth it, and couereth euery spotte that is in it.}"

69,13,18,"{\cf2 He calleth on him that is weake for health: he prayeth vnto him that is dead for life: he requireth him of helpe that hath no experience at all.}"

69,14,2,"{\cf2 For as for it, couetousnesse of money hath found it out, & the craftesman made it by cunning.}"
69,14,3,"{\cf2 But thy prouidence, O Father, gouerneth it: for thou hast made a way, euen in the sea, and a sure path among the waues,}"
69,14,4,"{\cf2 Declaring thereby, that thou hast power to helpe in all things, yea, though a man went to the sea without meanes.}"
69,14,5,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse thou wouldest not, that the workes of thy wisdome should be vaine, & therfore doe men comit their liues to a small piece of wood, & passe ouer the stormie sea in a ship, and are saued.}"
69,14,6,"{\cf2 For in the olde time also when the proude giants perished, the hope of the worlde went into a ship which was gouerned by thine hand, and so left seede of generation vnto the world.}"
69,14,7,"{\cf2 For blessed is the tree whereby righteousnes commeth.}"
69,14,8,"{\cf2 But that is cursed that is made with hands, both it, and he that made it: he because he made it, and it being a corruptible thing, because it was called God.}"
69,14,9,"{\cf2 For the vngodly, and his vngodlinesse are both like hated of God: so truly the worke and he that made it, shall be punished together.}"
69,14,10,"{\cf2 Therefore shall there be a visitation for the idoles of the nations: for of the creatures of God they are become abomination, and stumbling blockes vnto the soules of men, and a snare for the feete of the vnwise.}"
69,14,11,"{\cf2 For the inuenting of idoles was the beginning of whoredome, and the finding of them is the corruption of life.}"
69,14,12,"{\cf2 For they were not from the beginning, neither shall they continue for euer.}"
69,14,13,"{\cf2 The vaine glory of men brought them into ye world: therefore shall they come shortly to an end.}"
69,14,14,"{\cf2 When a father mourned grieuously for his sonne that was taken away suddenly, he made an image for him that was once dead, whom nowe he worshippeth as a god, and ordeined to his seruants ceremonies and sacrifices.}"
69,14,15,"{\cf2 Thus by proces of time this wicked custome preuailed, and was kept as a lawe, and idoles were worshipped by the commandement of tyrants.}"
69,14,16,"{\cf2 As for those that were so farre off that men might not worship them presently, they did counterfeit the visage that was farre off, and made a gorgeous image of a King, whom they would honour, that they might by all meanes flatter him that was absent, as though he had bene present.}"
69,14,17,"{\cf2 Againe the ambition of the craftesman thrust forward the ignorant to increase the superstition.}"
69,14,18,"{\cf2 For he peraduenture willing to please a noble man, laboured with all his cunning to make the image of the best fashion.}"
69,14,19,"{\cf2 And so thorowe ye beautie of the worke the multitude was allured, and so tooke him nowe for a God, which a litle afore was but honored as a man.}"
69,14,20,"{\cf2 And this was the deceiuing of mans life, when men, being in seruitude, through calamitie and tyrannie ascribed vnto stones and stockes the name, which ought not to be communicate vnto any.}"
69,14,21,"{\cf2 Moreouer, this was not ynough for the that they erred in the knowledge of God: but where as they liued in great warres of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace.}"
69,14,22,"{\cf2 For either they slewe their owne children in sacrifice, or vsed secret ceremonies, or raging dissolutenes by strange rites,}"
69,14,23,"{\cf2 And so kept neither life nor mariage cleane: but either one slewe another by treason, or els vexed him by adulterie.}"
69,14,24,"{\cf2 So were all mixt together, blood and slaughter, theft and deceit, corruption, vnfaithfulnesse, tumultes, periurie,}"
69,14,25,"{\cf2 Disquieting of good men, vnthankfulnesse, defiling of soules, changing of birth, disorder in mariage, adulterie and vncleannesse.}"
69,14,26,"{\cf2 For the worshipping of idoles that ought not to be named, is the beginning and the cause and the ende of all euill.}"
69,14,27,"{\cf2 For either they be mad when they be merie, or prophesie lyes, or liue vngodly, or els lightly forsweare themselues.}"
69,14,28,"{\cf2 For in so much as their trust is in the idoles, which haue no life, though they sweare falsely, yet they thinke to haue no hurt.}"
69,14,29,"{\cf2 Therefore for two causes shall they iustly be punished, because they haue an euill opinion of God, addicting them selues vnto idols, and because they sweare vniustly to deceiue, and despise holines.}"
69,14,30,"{\cf2 For it is not ye power of them by whom they sweare, but ye vengeance of them that sinne, which punisheth alwayes the offence of the vngodly.}"
69,15,1,"{\cf2 Bvt thou, O our God, art gracious and true, long suffering, and gouernest all things by mercie.}"
69,15,2,"{\cf2 Though we sinne, yet are we thine: for we knowe thy power: but we sinne not, knowing that we are counted thine.}"
69,15,3,"{\cf2 For to know thee, is perfite righteousnes, and to know thy power is the roote of immortalitie.}"
69,15,4,"{\cf2 For neither hath the wicked inuention of men deceiued vs, nor the vnprofitable labour of the painters, nor an image spotted with diuers colours.}"
69,15,5,"{\cf2 Whose fight stirreth vp the desire of the ignorant: so that he coueteth the forme that hath no life, of a dead image.}"
69,15,6,"{\cf2 They that loue such wicked things are worthie to haue such things to trust to, and they that make them, and they that desire them, and they that worship them.}"
69,15,7,"{\cf2 The potter also tempereth soft earth, and facioneth euery vessell with labour to our vse: but of the same clay he maketh both the vessels, that serue to cleane vses, and the contrary likewise: but whereto euery vessell serueth, the potter is ye iudge.}"
69,15,8,"{\cf2 So by his wicked labour he maketh a vaine God of the same clay: euen he, which a litle afore was made of earth himselfe, and within a litle while after goeth thither againe whence he was taken, when he shall make account for ye lone of his life.}"
69,15,9,"{\cf2 Notwithstanding he careth not for the labour he taketh, nor that his life is short, but he striueth with the goldsmithes, and siluersmithes, and counterfeiteth, the coppersmithes, and taketh it for an honour to make deceiueable things.}"
69,15,10,"{\cf2 His heart is ashes, & his hope is more vile then earth, & his life is lesse worthy of honour then clay.}"
69,15,11,"{\cf2 For he knoweth not his owne maker, that gaue him his soule, that had power and breathed in him the breath of life.}"
69,15,12,"{\cf2 But they count our life to be but a pastime, and our conuersation as a market, where there is gaine: for they say we ought to be getting on euery side, though it be by euill meanes.}"
69,15,13,"{\cf2 Nowe he that of earth maketh fraile vessels and images, knoweth himselfe to offend aboue all other.}"
69,15,14,"{\cf2 All the enemies of thy people, that hold them in subiection, are most vnwise, and more miserable then the very fooles.}"
69,15,15,"{\cf2 For they iudge all the idoles of the nations to be gods, which neither haue eye sight to see, nor noses to smell, nor eares to heare, nor fingers of handes to grope, and their feete are slowe to goe.}"
69,15,16,"{\cf2 For man made them, and he that hath but a borowed spirite, facioned them: but no man can make a God like vnto himselfe.}"
69,15,17,"{\cf2 For seeing he is but mortall himselfe, it is but mortall that he maketh with vnrighteous hands: he himselfe is better then they whom he worshippeth: for he liued, but they neuer liued.}"
69,15,18,"{\cf2 Yea, they worshipped beastes also, which are their most enemies, and which are the worst, if they be compared vnto others, because they haue none vnderstanding.}"
69,15,19,"{\cf2 Neither haue they any beautie to be desired in respect of other beastes: for they are destitute of Gods praise, and of his blessing.}"
69,16,1,"{\cf2 Therefore by such things they are worthily punished & tormented by ye multitude of beasts.}"
69,16,2,"{\cf2 In stead of the which punishment thou hast bene fauourable to thy people, and to satisfie their appetite, hast prepared a meat of a strange tast, euen quailes,}"
69,16,3,"{\cf2 To the intent that they that desired meat, by the things which were shewed & sent among them, might turne away their necessary desire, and that they, which had suffred penurie for a space, shoulde also feele a newe taste.}"
69,16,4,"{\cf2 For it was requisite, that they which vsed tyrannie, should fall into extreeme pouertie, and that to these onely it should be shewed, howe their enemies were tormented.}"
69,16,5,"{\cf2 For when the cruell fiercenes of the beasts came vpon them, & they were hurt with the stinges of cruell serpents,}"
69,16,6,"{\cf2 Thy wrath indured not perpetually, but they were troubled for a litle season, that they might bee reformed, hauing a signe of saluation, to remember the commandement of thy Lawe.}"
69,16,7,"{\cf2 For he that turned toward it, was not healed by the thing that he sawe, but by thee, O Sauiour of all.}"
69,16,8,"{\cf2 So in this thou shewedst our enemies, that it is thou, which deliuerest from all euill.}"
69,16,9,"{\cf2 For the biting of grashoppers and flies killed them, and there was no remedie found for their life: for they were worthy to be punished by such.}"
69,16,10,"{\cf2 But the teeth of the venemous dragos could not ouercome thy children: for thy mercy came to helpe them, and healed them.}"
69,16,11,"{\cf2 For they were pricked, because they should remember thy woordes, and were speedily healed, least they should fal into so deepe forgetfulnes, that they could not be called backe by thy benefite.}"
69,16,12,"{\cf2 For neither herbe nor plaster healed them, but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.}"
69,16,13,"{\cf2 For thou hast the power of life and death, and leadest downe vnto the gates of hell, & bringest vp againe.}"
69,16,14,"{\cf2 A man in deede by his wickednesse may slaie another: but when the spirite is gone foorth, it turneth not againe, neither can he cal againe the soule that is taken away.}"
69,16,15,"{\cf2 But it is not possible to escape thine hand.}"
69,16,16,"{\cf2 For the vngodly that woulde not knowe thee, were punished by the strength of thine arme, with strange raine and with haile, and were pursued with tempest, that they coulde not auoid, and were consumed with fire.}"
69,16,17,"{\cf2 For it was a wonderous thing that fire might doe more then water, which quencheth all things: but the world is the auenger of the righteous.}"
69,16,18,"{\cf2 For sometime was the fire so tame, that the beasts, which were sent against the vngodly, burnt not: and that, because they should see & know, that they were persecuted with the punishment of God.}"
69,16,19,"{\cf2 And sometime burnt the fire in the middes of the water aboue the power of fire, that it might destroy the generation of the vniust land.}"
69,16,20,"{\cf2 In the steade whereof thou hast fed thine owne people with Angels foode, and sent them bread readie from heauen without their labour, which had aboundance of al pleasures in it and was meete for all tastes.}"
69,16,21,"{\cf2 For thy sustenance declared thy sweetenesse vnto thy children, which serued to the appetite of him, that tooke it, and was meete to that that euery man would.}"
69,16,22,"{\cf2 Moreouer the snowe and yee abode the fire and melted not, that they might know, that the fire burning in the haile, and sparkeling in the raine, destroied the fruite of the enemies.}"
69,16,23,"{\cf2 Againe it forgate his owne strength, that the righteous might be nourished.}"
69,16,24,"{\cf2 For the creature that serueth thee which art the maker, is fierce in punishing the vnrighteous: but it is easie to doe good vnto such as put their trust in thee.}"
69,16,25,"{\cf2 Therefore was it changed at the same time vnto all facions to serue thy grace, which nourisheth all things, according to the desire of them that had neede thereof,}"
69,16,26,"{\cf2 That thy children whome thou louest, O Lorde, might knowe, that it is not the increase of fruites that feedeth men, but that it is thy woorde, which preserueth them that trust in thee.}"
69,16,27,"{\cf2 For that which coulde not be destroied with the fire, being onely warmed a little with the sunne beames, melted,}"
69,16,28,"{\cf2 That it might bee knowen that we ought to preuent the sunne rising to giue thanks vnto thee, and to salute thee before the day spring.}"
69,16,29,"{\cf2 For the hope of the vnthankfull shall melt as the winter yce, and flowe away as vnprofitable waters.}"
69,17,1,"{\cf2 For thy iudgements are great, and can not be expressed: therefore men doe erre, that will not be reformed.}"
69,17,2,"{\cf2 For when the vnrighteous thought to haue thine holy people in subiection, they were bounde with the bandes of darkenesse, and long night, and being shut vp vnder the roofe, did lie there to escape the euerlasting prouidence.}"
69,17,3,"{\cf2 And while they thought to bee hid in their darke sinnes, they were scattered abroade in the darke couering of forgetfulnesse, fearing horribly and troubled with visions.}"
69,17,4,"{\cf2 For the denne that hid them, kept them not from feare: but the soundes that were about them, troubled them, and terrible visions and sorowfull sightes did appeare.}"
69,17,5,"{\cf2 No power of the fire might giue light, neither might the cleare flames of the starres lighten the horrible night.}"
69,17,6,"{\cf2 For there appeared vnto them only a sudden fire, very dreadfull: so that being afraide of this vision, which they coulde not see, they thought the things, which they sawe, to be worse.}"
69,17,7,"{\cf2 And the illusions of the magical artes were brought downe, & it was a most shamefull reproch for the boasting of their knowledge.}"
69,17,8,"{\cf2 For they that promised to driue away feare and trouble from the sicke person, were sicke for feare, and worthy to be laughed at.}"
69,17,9,"{\cf2 And though no fearful thing did feare them, yet were they afraide at the beasts which passed by them, and at the hissing of the serpents: so that they died for feare, and sayd they saw not the aire, which by no meanes can be auoided.}"
69,17,10,"{\cf2 For it is a feareful thing, when malice is condemned by her owne testimonie: and a conscience that is touched, doeth euer forecast cruell things.}"
69,17,11,"{\cf2 For feare is nothing els, but a betraying of the succours, which reason offreth.}"
69,17,12,"{\cf2 And the lesse that the hope is within, the more doeth he esteeme the ignorance of the thing, that tormenteth him, great.}"
69,17,13,"{\cf2 But they that did endure the night that was intolerable, and that came out of the dungeon of hell, which is insupportable, slept the same sleepe,}"
69,17,14,"{\cf2 And sometimes were troubled with monstruous visions, and sometime they swooned, as though their owne soule should betraie them: for a sudden feare not looked for, came vpon them.}"
69,17,15,"{\cf2 And thus, whosoeuer fell downe, he was kept and shut in prison, but without chaines.}"
69,17,16,"{\cf2 For whether hee was an husband man, or a shepheard, or one that was set to worke alone, if he were taken, hee must suffer this necessitie, that hee could not auoide:}"
69,17,17,"{\cf2 (For with one chaine of darkenesse were they all bounde) whether it were an hissing winde, or a sweete song of the birdes among the thicke branches of the trees, or the vehemencie of hastie running water,}"
69,17,18,"{\cf2 Or a great noyse of the falling downe of stones, or the running of skipping beastes, that coulde not be seene, or the noise of cruell beastes, that roared, or the sounde that answereth againe in the holowe mountaines: these fearefull thinges made them to swoone.}"
69,17,19,"{\cf2 For al the world shined with cleare light, and no man was hindred in his labour.}"
69,17,20,"{\cf2 Onely vpon them there fell an heauie night, an image of that darkenesse that was to come vpon them: yea, they were vnto themselues more grieuous then darkenesse.}"
69,18,1,"{\cf2 Bvt thy Saintes had a very great light, whose voyce because they heard, and sawe not the figure of them, they thought them blessed, because they also had not suffred the like.}"
69,18,2,"{\cf2 And because they did not hurt them, which did hurt them afore, they thanked them, and asked pardon for their enimitie,}"
69,18,3,"{\cf2 Therefore thou gauest them a burning pillar of fire to leade them in the vnknowen way, and madest the sunne that it hurted not them in their honourable iourney.}"
69,18,4,"{\cf2 But they were worthy to be depriued of the light, and to be kept in darkenesse, which had kept thy children shut vp, by whom the vncorrupt light of the Lawe should be giuen to the world.}"
69,18,5,"{\cf2 Whereas they thought to slay the babes of the Saints, by one childe that was cast out, and preserued to reprooue them, thou hast taken away the multitude of their children and destroied them all together in the mightie water.}"
69,18,6,"{\cf2 Of that night were our fathers certified afore, that they knowing vnto what othes they had giuen credite, might be of good cheere.}"
69,18,7,"{\cf2 Thus thy people receiued the health of the righteous, but the enemies were destroied.}"
69,18,8,"{\cf2 For as thou hast punished the enemies, so hast thou glorified vs whome thou hast called.}"
69,18,9,"{\cf2 For the righteous children of the good men offred secretely, and made a Lawe of righteousnesse by one consent, that the Saintes shoulde receiue good and euill in like maner, and that the fathers should first sing praises.}"
69,18,10,"{\cf2 But a disagreeing crie was hearde of the enemies, and there was a lamentable noise for the children that were bewailed.}"
69,18,11,"{\cf2 For the maister and the seruant were punished with like punishment, and the common people suffred alike with the King.}"
69,18,12,"{\cf2 So they all together had innumerable that died with one kinde of death: neither were ye liuing sufficient to burie them: for in the twinckling of an eye the noblest offspring of them was destroied.}"
69,18,13,"{\cf2 So they that could beleeue nothing, because of ye inchantments, confessed this people to be the children of God, in the destruction of ye first borne:}"
69,18,14,"{\cf2 For while all things were in quiet silence, and the night was in the middest of her swift course,}"
69,18,15,"{\cf2 Thine almighty woorde leapt downe from heauen out of thy royall throne, as a fierce man of warre in the middes of the lande that was destroied,}"
69,18,16,"{\cf2 And brought thine vnfained commaundement as a sharpe sworde, and stoode vp and filled all thinges with death, and being come downe to the earth, it reached vnto the heauens.}"
69,18,17,"{\cf2 Then the sight of the fearefull dreames vexed them suddenly, and fearefulnes came vpon them vnawares.}"
69,18,18,"{\cf2 Then lay there one here, another there halfe dead, and shewed the cause of his death.}"
69,18,19,"{\cf2 For the visios that vexed them, shewed them these things afore: so that they were not ignorant, wherefore they perished.}"
69,18,20,"{\cf2 Nowe tentation of death touched the righteous also, and among the multitude in the wildernesse there was a plague, but the wrath indured not long.}"
69,18,21,"{\cf2 For the blameles man made haste, and defended them, and tooke the weapons of his ministration, euen prayer, and the reconciliation by the perfume, and set himselfe against the wrath, and so brought the miserie to an ende, declaring that hee was thy seruaunt.}"
69,18,22,"{\cf2 For he ouercame not the multitude with bodily power, nor with force of weapons, but with the word he subdued him that punished, alleadging the othes and couenant made vnto the fathers.}"
69,18,23,"{\cf2 For when the dead were fallen downe by heapes one vpon another, hee stoode in the middes, and cut off the wrath, and parted it from comming to the liuing.}"

69,19,1,"{\cf2 As for the vngodly, the wrath came vpon them without mercy vnto the ende: for hee knewe what should come vnto them,}"
69,19,2,"{\cf2 That they, (when they had consented to let them goe, and had sent them out with diligence) would repent, and pursue them.}"
69,19,3,"{\cf2 For while yet sorowe was before them, and they lamented by the graues of the dead, they deuised another foolishnesse, so that they persecuted them in their fleeing, whome they had cast out afore with praier.}"
69,19,4,"{\cf2 For the destinie, whereof they were worthy, brought them to this ende, and caused them toforget the things that had come to passe, that they might accomplish the punishment, which remained by torments,}"
69,19,5,"{\cf2 Both that thy people might trie a marueilous passage, and that these might finde a strange death.}"

69,19,7,"{\cf2 For the cloude ouershadowed their tentes, and the drye earth appeared, where afore was water: so that in the red sea there was a way without impediment, and the great deepe became a greene fielde.}"
69,19,8,"{\cf2 Through the which all the people went that were defended with thine hand, seeing thy wonderous marueiles.}"
69,19,9,"{\cf2 For they neyed like horses, and leaped like lambes, praysing thee, O Lord, which haddest deliuered them.}"
69,19,10,"{\cf2 For they were yet mindfull of those thinges which were done in the land where they dwelt, how the ground brought forth flyes, in steade of cattell, and howe the riuer scrauled with the multitude of frogges in steade of fishes.}"
69,19,11,"{\cf2 But at the last they sawe a newe generation of birdes, when they were intised with lust, and desired delicate meates.}"
69,19,12,"{\cf2 For the quailes came foorth of the sea vnto them for comfort, but punishments came vpon the sinners not without signes that were giuen by great thundrings: for they suffered worthily according to their wickednesse, because they shewed a cruell hatred toward strangers.}"
69,19,13,"{\cf2 For ye one sort would not receiue them when they were present, because they knewe them not: the other sort brought the strangers into bondage that had done them good.}"

69,19,15,"{\cf2 Others that had receiued them with great banketting, and admitted them to be partakers of the same lawes, did afflict them with great labours.}"
69,19,16,"{\cf2 Therefore they were stricken with blindnes, as in olde time certeine were at the doores of the righteous, so that euery one being compassed with darknesse, sought the entrance of his doore.}"
69,19,17,"{\cf2 Thus the elements agreed among themselues in this change, as when one tune is changed vpon an instrument of musike, and the melodie still remaineth, which may easily be perceiued by the sight of the things that are come to passe.}"
69,19,18,"{\cf2 For the things of the earth were changed into things of the water, and the thing that did swimme went vpon the ground.}"

71,6,19,"{\cf2 They confesse, that euen their hearts are gnawen vpon: but when the things, that creepe out of the earth, eate them and their clothes, they feele it not.}"
71,6,20,"{\cf2 Their faces are blacke through the smoke that is in the temple.}"
71,6,21,"{\cf2 The owles, swalowes & birdes flie vpon their bodies, & vpon their heades, yea, and the cattes also.}"
71,6,22,"{\cf2 By this yee may be sure, that they are not gods: therefore feare them not.}"
71,6,23,"{\cf2 Notwithstanding the golde, that is about them to make them beautifull, except one wipe of the rust, they cannot shine: neither when they were molten, did they feele it.}"
71,6,24,"{\cf2 The things wherein is no breath, are bought for a most high price.}"
71,6,25,"{\cf2 They are borne vpon mens shoulders, because they haue no feete, whereby they declare vnto men, that they be nothing woorth: yea, and they that worship them, are ashamed.}"
71,6,26,"{\cf2 For if they fall to the grounde at any time, they can not rise vp againe of themselues, neither if one set them vp right, can they mooue of them selues, neither if they be bowed downe, can they make them selues streight: but they set gifts before them, as vnto dead men.}"
71,6,27,"{\cf2 As for the things that are offered vnto them, their Priests sell them, and abuse them: likewise also the women lay vp of the same: but vnto the poore and sicke they giue nothing.}"
71,6,28,"{\cf2 The menstruous women, and they that are in childbed, touch their sacrifices: by these things ye may knowe that they are no gods: feare them not.}"
71,6,29,"{\cf2 From whence commeth it then, that they are called gods? because the women bring giftes to the gods of siluer, and golde, and wood.}"
71,6,30,"{\cf2 And the priestes sit in their temples, hauing their clothes rent, whose heades and beards are shauen, and being bare headed,}"
71,6,31,"{\cf2 They roare, and cry before their gods, as men doe at the feast of one that is dead.}"
71,6,32,"{\cf2 The priests also take away of their garments, and clothe their wiues and children.}"
71,6,33,"{\cf2 Whether it be euil that one doeth vnto them or good, they are not able to recompence it: they can neither set vp a King nor put him downe.}"
71,6,34,"{\cf2 In like maner they can neither giue riches, nor money: though a man make a vowe vnto them and keepe it not, they will not require it.}"
71,6,35,"{\cf2 They can saue no man from death, neither deliuer the weake from the mightie.}"
71,6,36,"{\cf2 They cannot restore a blind man to his sight, nor helpe any man at his neede.}"
71,6,37,"{\cf2 They can shewe no mercy to the widdowe, nor doe good to the fatherlesse.}"
71,6,38,"{\cf2 Their gods of wood, golde, and siluer, are as stones, that bee hewen out of the mountaine, and they that worship them, shall be confounded.}"
71,6,39,"{\cf2 Howe shoulde a man then thinke or say that they are Gods?}"
71,6,40,"{\cf2 Moreouer the Chaldeans them selues dishonour them: for when they see a domme man, that can not speake, they present him to Bel,}"
71,6,41,"{\cf2 And desire that hee woulde make him to speake, as though he had any feeling: yet they that vnderstande these thinges, can not leaue them: for they also haue no sense.}"
71,6,42,"{\cf2 Furthermore the wome, girded with coards, sitte in the streetes, and burne strawe.}"
71,6,43,"{\cf2 And if one of them be drawen away, and lie with any such as come by, shee casteth her neighbour in the teeth, because shee was not so worthily reputed, nor her coarde broken.}"
71,6,44,"{\cf2 Whatsoeuer is done among them, is lies: how may it then be thought or saide, that they are gods?}"
71,6,45,"{\cf2 Carpenters and goldsmithes make them, neither be they any other thing, but euen what the workeman will make them.}"
71,6,46,"{\cf2 Yea, they that make them, are of no long cotinuance: how should then the things that are made of them, be gods?}"
71,6,47,"{\cf2 Therefore they leaue lies, and shame for their posteritie.}"
71,6,48,"{\cf2 For when there cometh any warre or plague vpon them, the Priestes imagine with them selues, where they may hide themselues with them.}"
71,6,49,"{\cf2 Howe then can men not perceiue, that they be no gods, which can neither defende themselues, from warre nor from plagues:}"
71,6,50,"{\cf2 For seeing they be but of wood, and of siluer, and of golde, men shall knowe hereafter that they are but lies, and it shall be manifest to all nations & Kings, that they be no gods, but the workes of mens handes, and that there is no woorke of God in them.}"
71,6,51,"{\cf2 Whereby it may be knowen, that they are no gods.}"
71,6,52,"{\cf2 They can set vp no King in the lande, nor giue raine vnto men.}"
71,6,53,"{\cf2 They can giue no sentence of a matter, neither preserue from iniurie: they haue no power, but are as crowes betweene the heauen and the earth.}"
71,6,54,"{\cf2 When there falleth a fire vpon the house of those gods of wood, and of siluer, and of golde, the priestes will escape and saue them selues, but they burne as the balkes therein.}"
71,6,55,"{\cf2 They cannot wtstand any King or enemies: how can it then be thought or said that they be gods?}"
71,6,56,"{\cf2 Moreouer these gods of wood, of golde, and of siluer can neither defed themselues from theeues nor robbers.}"
71,6,57,"{\cf2 For they that are strongest, take away their golde and siluer, and apparell, wherewith they be clothed: and when they haue it, they get them away, yet can they not helpe themselues.}"
71,6,58,"{\cf2 Therefore it is better to be a King, and so to shewe his power, or els a profitable vessell in an house, whereby hee that oweth it, might haue profite, then such false gods: or to bee a doore in an house, to keepe such thinges safe as be therein, then such false gods: or a pillar of wood in a palace, then such false gods.}"
71,6,59,"{\cf2 For the sunne, and the moone, & the starres that shine, when they are sent downe for necessarie vses, obey.}"
71,6,60,"{\cf2 Likewise also the lightning, when it shineth, it is euident: and the winde bloweth in euery countrey.}"
71,6,61,"{\cf2 And when God commandeth the cloudes to go about ye whole world, they do as they are bidden.}"
71,6,62,"{\cf2 When the fire is sent downe from aboue to destroy hilles and woodes, it doeth that which is commaunded: but these are not like any of these things, neither in forme, nor power.}"
71,6,63,"{\cf2 Wherefore men should not thinke, nor say that they be goddes, seeing they can neither giue sentence in iudgement, nor doe men good.}"
71,6,64,"{\cf2 For so much nowe as yee are sure, that they be no gods, feare them not.}"
71,6,65,"{\cf2 For they can neither curse, nor blesse Kings:}"
71,6,66,"{\cf2 Neither can they shewe signes in the heauen among the heathen, neither shine as the moone.}"
71,6,67,"{\cf2 The beastes are better then they: for they ca get them vnder a couert, & do themselues good.}"
71,6,68,"{\cf2 So yee may bee certified that by no maner of, meanes, they are gods: therefore feare them not.}"
71,6,69,"{\cf2 For as a skarcrowe in a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing, so are their goddes of wood, and of siluer, and of golde:}"
71,6,70,"{\cf2 And likewise their gods of wood, and golde and siluer are like to a white thorne in an orcharde, that euery birde sitteth vpon, and as a deade bodie that is cast in the darke.}"
71,6,71,"{\cf2 By the purple also and brightnesse, which fadeth vpon them, yee may vnderstande, that they be no gods: yea, they themselues shall be consumed at the last, and they shall be a shame to the countrey.}"
71,6,72,"{\cf2 Better therefore is the iust man, that hath none idoles: for he shalbe farre from reproofe.}"
72,1,1,"{\cf2 After that Alexander the Macedonian, the sonne of Philippe, went forth of the land of Chettiim, and slewe Darius King of the Persians & Medes, and reigned for him, as he had before in Grecia,}"
72,1,2,"{\cf2 He tooke great warres in hand, and wanne strong holdes, and slewe the Kings of the earth.}"
72,1,3,"{\cf2 So went he thorow to the endes of the world, and tooke spoyles of many nations, in so much that the world stood in awe of him: therefore his heart was puffed vp and was hawtie.}"
72,1,4,"{\cf2 Now when he had gathered a mightie strong hoste,}"
72,1,5,"{\cf2 And had reigned ouer regions, nations and kingdomes, they became tributaries vnto him.}"
72,1,6,"{\cf2 After these things he fell sicke, and knew that he should dye.}"
72,1,7,"{\cf2 Then he called for the chiefe of his seruants, which had bene brought vp with him of children, and parted his kingdome among them, while he was yet aliue.}"
72,1,8,"{\cf2 So Alexander had reigned twelue yeres when he died.}"
72,1,9,"{\cf2 And his seruats reigned euery one in his roume.}"
72,1,10,"{\cf2 And they all caused them selues to be crownedafter his death, and so did their children after them many yeeres, and much wickednes increased in the worlde.}"
72,1,11,"{\cf2 For out of these came the wicked roote, euen Antiochus Epiphanes, the sonne of King Antiochus, which had bene an hostage at Rome, and he reigned in the hundreth and seuen & thirtieth yere of the kingdome of the Greekes.}"
72,1,12,"{\cf2 In those dayes went there out of Israel wicked men, which entised many, saying, Let vs go, and make a couenant with the heathen, that are round about vs: for since we departed from them, we haue had much sorow.}"
72,1,13,"{\cf2 So this deuice pleased them well.}"
72,1,14,"{\cf2 And certaine of the people were readie, and went to the King, which gaue them licence to doe after the ordinances of the heathen.}"
72,1,15,"{\cf2 Then set they vp a place of exercise at Ierusalem, according to the facions of the heathen,}"
72,1,16,"{\cf2 And made themselues vncircumcised, & forsooke the holy Couenant, & ioyned themselues to the heathen, and were solde to do mischiefe.}"
72,1,17,"{\cf2 So when Antiochus kingdome was set in order, he went about to reigne ouer Egypt, that hee might haue the dominion of two Realmes.}"
72,1,18,"{\cf2 Therfore he entred into Egypt with a mightie company, with charets, and Elephants, and with horsemen, and with a great nauie,}"
72,1,19,"{\cf2 And moued warre against Ptolemeus King of Egypt: but Ptolemeus was afrayd of him, & fled, and many were wounded to death.}"
72,1,20,"{\cf2 Thus Antiochus wanne many strong cities in the land of Egypt, and tooke away the spoyles of the land of Egypt.}"
72,1,21,"{\cf2 And after that Antiochus had smitte Egypt, he turned againe in the hundreth, fourtie and three yeere,}"
72,1,22,"{\cf2 And went vp towarde Israel and Ierusalem with a mightie people,}"
72,1,23,"{\cf2 And entred proudely into the Sanctuarie, & tooke away the golden altar, and the candlesticke for the light, & all the instruments thereof, and the table of the shewbread, and the powring vessels, & the bowles, and the golden basins, & the vaile, and the crownes, and the golden apparel, which was before the Temple, and brake all in pieces.}"
72,1,24,"{\cf2 He tooke also the siluer and golde, and the precious iewels, & he tooke the secret treasures that he founde, and when he had taken away all, he departed into his owne land,}"
72,1,25,"{\cf2 After he had murthered many men, & spoken very proudely.}"
72,1,26,"{\cf2 Therefore there was a great lamentation in euery place of Israel.}"
72,1,27,"{\cf2 For the Princes & the Elders mourned: the yong women, & the yong men were made feeble, and the beautie of the women was changed.}"
72,1,28,"{\cf2 Euery bridegrome tooke him to mourning, and shee that sate in the marriage chamber, was in heauinesse.}"
72,1,29,"{\cf2 The lande also was mooued for the inhabitants thereof: for all the house of Iacob was couered with confusion.}"
72,1,30,"{\cf2 After two yeres the King sent his chiefe taxe master into the cities of Iuda, which came to Ierusalem with a great multitude.}"
72,1,31,"{\cf2 Who spake peaceable wordes vnto them in deceite, and they gaue credit vnto him.}"
72,1,32,"{\cf2 Then he fell suddenly vpon the citie, and smote it with a great plague, and destroyed much people of Israel.}"
72,1,33,"{\cf2 And when he had spoiled the citie, he set fire on it, casting downe the houses thereof, and walles thereof on euery side.}"
72,1,34,"{\cf2 The women and their children tooke they captiue, and led away the cattell.}"
72,1,35,"{\cf2 Then fortified they the citie of Dauid with a great and thicke wall, and with mightie towres, and made it a strong holde for them.}"
72,1,36,"{\cf2 Moreouer they set wicked people there, and vngodly persons, & fortified themselues therein.}"
72,1,37,"{\cf2 And they stored it with weapons & vitailes, and gathered the spoyle of Ierusalem, and layed it vp there.}"
72,1,38,"{\cf2 Thus became they a sore snare and were in ambushment for the Sanctuarie, and were wicked enemies euermore vnto Israel.}"
72,1,39,"{\cf2 For they shed innocent blood on euery side of the Sanctuarie, and defiled the Sanctuarie,}"
72,1,40,"{\cf2 Insomuch that the citizens of Ierusalem fled away because of them, and it became an habitation of strangers, being desolate of them whom she had borne: for her owne children did leaue her.}"
72,1,41,"{\cf2 Her Sanctuarie was left waste as a wildernes: her holy dayes were turned into mourning, her Sabbaths into reproche, and her honour brought to naught.}"
72,1,42,"{\cf2 As her glory had bene great, so was her dishonour, & her excellencie was turned into sorowe.}"
72,1,43,"{\cf2 Also the King wrote vnto all his kingdome, that all the people should be as one, and that euery man should leaue his lawes.}"
72,1,44,"{\cf2 And all the heathen agreed to the commandement of the King.}"
72,1,45,"{\cf2 Yea, many of the Israelites consented to his religion, offring vnto idoles, & defiling ye Sabbath.}"
72,1,46,"{\cf2 So the King sent letters by the messengers vnto Ierusalem, and to the cities of Iuda, that they should follow the strange lawes of the countrey,}"
72,1,47,"{\cf2 And that they should forbid the burnt offerings, & sacrifices, & the offrings in the Sanctuary,}"
72,1,48,"{\cf2 And that they shoulde defile the Sabbaths and the feastes,}"
72,1,49,"{\cf2 And pollute the Sanctuary & the holy men,}"
72,1,50,"{\cf2 And to set vp altars, and groues, and chappels of idoles, and offer vp swines fleshe, and vncleane beastes,}"
72,1,51,"{\cf2 And that they shoulde leaue their children vncircumcised, & defile their soules with vncleannes, and pollute themselues, that they might forget the Lawe, and change all the ordinances,}"
72,1,52,"{\cf2 And that whosoeuer woulde not doe acoording to the commandement of the King, shoulde suffer death.}"
72,1,53,"{\cf2 In like maner wrote he throughout all his kingdomes, and set ouerseers ouer all the people, for to compell them to do these things.}"
72,1,54,"{\cf2 And he commanded the cities of Iuda to do sacrifice, citie by citie.}"
72,1,55,"{\cf2 Then went many of the people vnto them by heapes, euery one that forsooke the Law, and so they committed euill in the land.}"
72,1,56,"{\cf2 And they droue the Israelites into secret places, euen wheresoeuer they could flee for succour.}"
72,1,57,"{\cf2 The fifteenth day of Casleu, in the hundreth and fiue and fourtieth yeere, they set vp the abomination of desolation vpon the altar, and they buylded altars throughout the cities of Iuda on euery side.}"
72,1,58,"{\cf2 And before the doores of the houses, and in the streetes they burnt incense.}"
72,1,59,"{\cf2 And the bookes of the Lawe, which they found, they burnt in the fire, and cut in pieces.}"
72,1,60,"{\cf2 Whosoeuer had a booke of the Testament founde by him, or whosoeuer consented vnto the Lawe, the Kings commaundement was, that they should put him to death by their authoritie.}"
72,1,61,"{\cf2 And they executed these things euery moneth vpon the people of Israel that were founde in their cities.}"
72,1,62,"{\cf2 And in the fiue & twentieth day of the moneth, they did sacrifice vpon the altar, which was in the stead of the altar of sacrifices.}"
72,1,63,"{\cf2 And according to the commandement, they put certeine women to death, which had caused their children to be circumcised,}"
72,1,64,"{\cf2 And they hanged vp the children at their neckes, and they spoyled their houses, and slew the circumcisers of them.}"
72,1,65,"{\cf2 Yet were there many in Israel, which were of courage, and determined in themselues, that they would not eate vncleane things,}"
72,1,66,"{\cf2 But chose rather to suffer death, the to be defiled with those meates: so because they would not breake the holy couenant, they were put to death.}"
72,1,67,"{\cf2 And this tyrannie was very sore vpon the people of Israel.}"
72,2,1,"{\cf2 In those dayes stoode vp Mattathias the Priest, the sonne of Ioannes, the sonne of Simeon, of the sonnes of Ioarib of Ierusalem, and dwelt in Modin.}"
72,2,2,"{\cf2 And hee had fiue sonnes, Ioanan called Gaddis,}"
72,2,3,"{\cf2 Simon called Thassi,}"
72,2,4,"{\cf2 Iudas which was called Maccabeus,}"
72,2,5,"{\cf2 Eleazar called Abaron, & Ionathan, whose name was Apphus.}"
72,2,6,"{\cf2 Nowe he sawe the blasphemies, which were committed in Iuda and Ierusalem:}"
72,2,7,"{\cf2 And he sayde, Woe is me: wherefore was I borne, to see this destruction of my people, and the destruction of the holy citie, & thus to sit still? it is deliuered into the handes of the enemies,}"
72,2,8,"{\cf2 And the Sanctuarie is in the hands of strangers: her Temple is as a man that hath no renoume.}"
72,2,9,"{\cf2 Her glorious vessels are caried away into captiuitie: her infants are slayne in the streetes, and her yong men are fallen by the sworde of the enemies.}"
72,2,10,"{\cf2 What people is it, that hath not some possession in her kingdome, or hath not gotten of her spoyles?}"
72,2,11,"{\cf2 Al her glory is taken away: of a free woman, she is become an handmayde.}"
72,2,12,"{\cf2 Behold, our Sanctuarie and our beautie, and honour is desolate, & the Gentiles haue defiled it.}"
72,2,13,"{\cf2 What helpeth it vs then to liue any longer?}"
72,2,14,"{\cf2 And Mattathias rent his clothes, he, and his sonnes, and put sackcloth vpon them, and mourned very sore.}"
72,2,15,"{\cf2 Then came men from the King to the citie of Modin to compell them to forsake God, and to sacrifice.}"
72,2,16,"{\cf2 So many of the Israelites consented vnto them: but Mattathias and his sonnes assembled together.}"
72,2,17,"{\cf2 Then spake the Commissioners of the King, and sayd vnto Mattathias, Thou art the chiefe and an honourable man, and great in this citie, & hast many children and brethren.}"
72,2,18,"{\cf2 Come thou therfore first, & fulfil the Kings commandement, as all the heathen haue done, and also the men of Iuda, and such as remaine at Ierusalem: so shalt thou & thy familie be in the Kings fauour, and thou & thy children shalbe enriched with siluer and golde, and with many rewardes.}"
72,2,19,"{\cf2 Then Mattathias answered and sayde with a loude voyce, Though all nations that are vnder the Kings dominion, obey him, & fall away euery man from the religion of their fathers, and consent to his commandements,}"
72,2,20,"{\cf2 Yet will I and my sonnes, and my brethren, walke in the couenant of our fathers.}"
72,2,21,"{\cf2 God be merciful vnto vs, that we forsake not the Law and the ordinances.}"
72,2,22,"{\cf2 We wil not hearken vnto the Kings wordes to transgresse our religion, neither on the right side, nor on the left.}"
72,2,23,"{\cf2 And when hee had left off speaking these words, there came one of the Iewes, in the sight of all to sacrifice vpon the altar which was at Modin, according to the Kings commandement.}"
72,2,24,"{\cf2 Nowe when Mattathias sawe it, he was so inflamed with zeale, that his raynes shooke, and his wrath was kindled according to the ordinance of the Lawe: therefore he ranne vnto him, and killed him by the altar:}"
72,2,25,"{\cf2 And at the same time he slewe ye Kings commissioner, that compelled him to doe sacrifice, and destroyed the altar.}"
72,2,26,"{\cf2 Thus bare hee a zeale to the Lawe of God, doing, as Phinees did vnto Zambri the sonne of Salom.}"
72,2,27,"{\cf2 Then cryed Mattathias with a loude voyce in the citie, saying, Whosoeuer is zealous of the Law, and will stand by the couenant, let him come forth after me.}"
72,2,28,"{\cf2 So he, & his sonnes fled into the moutaines, and left all that they had in the citie.}"
72,2,29,"{\cf2 Then many that sought after iustice and iudgement,}"
72,2,30,"{\cf2 Went downe into the wildernesse to dwell there, both they, and their children, & their wiues, and their cattell: for the afflictions increased sore vpon them.}"
72,2,31,"{\cf2 Nowe when it was tolde vnto the Kings seruants, and to the garisons, which were in Ierusalem in the citie of Dauid, that men had broken the Kings commandement, and were gone downe into the secret places in the wildernesse,}"
72,2,32,"{\cf2 Then many pursued after them: and hauing ouertaken them, they camped against them, & set the battel in aray against them on the Sabbath day,}"
72,2,33,"{\cf2 And sayd vnto them, Let this now be sufficient: come forth and do according to the commandement of the King, and ye shal liue.}"
72,2,34,"{\cf2 But they answered, We will not goe forth, neither will we doe the Kings commandement, to defile the Sabbath day.}"
72,2,35,"{\cf2 Then they gaue them the battell.}"
72,2,36,"{\cf2 But the other answered them nothing, neyther cast any one stone at them, nor stopped the priuie places,}"
72,2,37,"{\cf2 But sayde, We will die all in our innocencie: the heauen and earth shal testifie for vs, that ye destroy vs wrongfully.}"
72,2,38,"{\cf2 Thus they gaue them the battel vpon ye Sabbath, and slewe both men & cattell, their wiues and their children to the number of a thousand people.}"
72,2,39,"{\cf2 When Mattathias and his friendes vnderstood this, they mourned for them greatly,}"
72,2,40,"{\cf2 And said one to another, If we all doe as our brethren haue done, and fight not against the heathen for our liues, and for our Lawes, then shal they incontinently destroy vs out of the earth.}"
72,2,41,"{\cf2 Therefore they concluded at the same time, saying, Whosoeuer shall come to make battel with vs vpon the Sabboth day, we wil fight against him, that wee die not all, as our brethren that were murthered in the secret places.}"
72,2,42,"{\cf2 Then came vnto them the assembly of the Asideans, which were of the strongest men of Israel, al such as were wel minded toward the Lawe.}"
72,2,43,"{\cf2 And all they that were fled for persecution, ioyned them selues vnto them, and were an helpe vnto them.}"
72,2,44,"{\cf2 So they gathered a power, and smote the wicked men in their wrath, and ye vngodly in their anger: but the rest fledde vnto the heathen, and escaped.}"
72,2,45,"{\cf2 Then Mattathias and his friendes went about, and destroyed the altars,}"
72,2,46,"{\cf2 And circumcised the children by force that were vncircumcised, as many as they found within the coastes of Israel,}"
72,2,47,"{\cf2 And they pursued after the proude men: and this acte prospered in their hands.}"
72,2,48,"{\cf2 So they recouered the Lawe out of the hand of the Gentiles, and out of the hande of Kings, and gaue not place to the wicked.}"
72,2,49,"{\cf2 Nowe when the time drewe neere, that Mattathias should die, he saide vnto his sonnes, Nowe is pride and persecution increased, and the time of destruction, and the wrath of indignation.}"
72,2,50,"{\cf2 Nowe therefore, my sonnes, be ye zealous of the Lawe, and giue your liues for the couenant of our fathers.}"
72,2,51,"{\cf2 Call to remembrance what actes our fathers did in their time: so shall yee receiue great honour and an euerlasting name.}"
72,2,52,"{\cf2 Was not Abraham found faithful in tentation, & it was imputed vnto him for righteousnesse?}"
72,2,53,"{\cf2 Ioseph in the time of his trouble kept the commandement, and was made the lord of Egypt.}"
72,2,54,"{\cf2 Phinees our father, because he was zealous and feruent, obtained the couenant of the euerlasting Priesthood.}"
72,2,55,"{\cf2 Iesus for fulfilling the word, was made the gouernour of Israel.}"
72,2,56,"{\cf2 Caleb, because he bare witnesse before the Congregation, receiued the heritage of the land.}"
72,2,57,"{\cf2 Dauid, because of his mercie obtained the throne of the kingdome for euermore.}"
72,2,58,"{\cf2 Elias, because he was zealous and feruent in the Lawe, was taken vp euen vnto heauen.}"
72,2,59,"{\cf2 Ananias, Azarias and Misael by their faith were deliuered out of the flame.}"
72,2,60,"{\cf2 Daniel, because of his innocencie, was deliuered from the mouth of the Lyons.}"

72,2,62,"{\cf2 Feare not ye then the words of a sinful man: for his glory is but dongue and wormes.}"
72,2,63,"{\cf2 To day is he set vp, and to morowe hee shall not be found: for he is turned into his dust, and his purpose perisheth.}"
72,2,64,"{\cf2 Wherefore, my sonnes, take good hearts, and shewe your selues men for the Lawes for by it shall you obtaine glory.}"
72,2,65,"{\cf2 And beholde, I knowe that your brother Simon is a man of counsel: giue care vnto him alway: he shall be a father vnto you.}"
72,2,66,"{\cf2 And Iudas Maccabeus hath bin mightie and strong, euen from his youth vp: let him bee your captaine, and fight you the battell for the people.}"
72,2,67,"{\cf2 Thus shall yee bring vnto you all those that obserue the Lawe, and shall auenge the iniuries of your people.}"
72,2,68,"{\cf2 Recompence fully the heathe, and giue your selues to the commandement of the Lawe.}"
72,2,69,"{\cf2 So hee blessed them, and was layed with his fathers,}"
72,2,70,"{\cf2 And died in the hundreth, fourtie and sixe yeere, and his sonnes buried him in his fathers sepulchre at Modin, and all Israel made great lamentation for him.}"
72,3,1,"{\cf2 Then Iudas his sonne, called Maccabeus, rose vp in his place.}"
72,3,2,"{\cf2 And all his brethren helped him, and all they that held with his father, and fought with courage the battell of Israel.}"
72,3,3,"{\cf2 So he gate his people great honour: he put on a breastplate as a gyant, and armed himselfe, and set the battell in array, and defended the campe with the sword.}"
72,3,4,"{\cf2 In his actes he was like a Lion, and as a Lyons whelpe roaring after the pray.}"
72,3,5,"{\cf2 For he pursued the wicked, and sought them out, and burnt vp those that vexed his people,}"
72,3,6,"{\cf2 So that the wicked fled for feare of him, and all the workers of iniquitie were put to trouble: and saluation prospered in his hand.}"
72,3,7,"{\cf2 And hee grieued diuers Kings, but Iacob reioyced by his actes, and his memoriall is blessed for euer.}"
72,3,8,"{\cf2 He went also thorowe the cities of Iuda, and destroied the wicked out of them, and turned away the wrath from Israel.}"
72,3,9,"{\cf2 So was hee renowmed vnto the endes of the earth, and hee assembled together those that were ready to perish.}"
72,3,10,"{\cf2 But Apollonius gathered the Gentiles, & a great host out of Samaria, to fight against Israel.}"
72,3,11,"{\cf2 Which when Iudas perceiued, he went forth to meete him, and smote him, and slewe him, so that many fell downe slayne, and the rest fled.}"
72,3,12,"{\cf2 So Iudas tooke their spoyles, and tooke also Apollonius sworde, and fought with it all his life long.}"
72,3,13,"{\cf2 Nowe when Seron a prince of the armie of Syria, heard that Iudas had gathered vnto him the Congregation, and Church of the faithfull, and went forth to the warre,}"
72,3,14,"{\cf2 He sayd, I wil get me a name, and wil be glorious in the realme: for I will goe fight with Iudas, and them that are with him, which haue despised the kings commandement.}"
72,3,15,"{\cf2 So he made him ready to go vp, & there went with him a mightie hoste of the vngodly to helpe him, and to be auenged of the children of Israel.}"
72,3,16,"{\cf2 And when he came neere to the going vp of Bethhoron, Iudas went forth to meete him with a small companie.}"
72,3,17,"{\cf2 But when they sawe the army comming against them, they sayde to Iudas, Howe are wee able, being so fewe, to fight against so great a multitude, and so strong, seeing we be so weary, and haue fasted all this day?}"
72,3,18,"{\cf2 Then said Iudas, It is an easie thing for many to be shut vp in the hands of fewe, and there is no difference before the God of heauen, to deliuer by a great multitude, or by a small company.}"
72,3,19,"{\cf2 For the victory of the battell standeth not in the multitude of the host, but the strength commeth from heauen.}"
72,3,20,"{\cf2 They come against vs with a cruel & proud multitude, to destroy vs, and our wiues, & our children, and to robbe vs.}"
72,3,21,"{\cf2 But wee doe fight for our liues, and for our Lawes,}"
72,3,22,"{\cf2 And God himselfe will destroy them before our face: therefore be not ye afraide of them.}"
72,3,23,"{\cf2 And when he had left off speaking, he leapt suddenly vpon them: so was Seron and his host destroyed before him.}"
72,3,24,"{\cf2 And they pursued them fro the going downe of Bethhoron vnto the plaine: where there were slaine eight hundreth men of them, and the residue fled into the land of the Philistimes.}"
72,3,25,"{\cf2 Then the feare and terrour of Iudas and his brethren fell vpon the nations round about,}"
72,3,26,"{\cf2 So that his fame came vnto the king: for all the Gentiles could tell of the warres of Iudas.}"
72,3,27,"{\cf2 But when king Antiochus heard these tidings, he was angry in his minde: wherefore he sent forth, and gathered all the power of his realme, a very strong army,}"
72,3,28,"{\cf2 And opened his treasurie, and gaue his host a yeeres wages in hande, commanding them to be ready for a yeere for all occasions.}"
72,3,29,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse, when he sawe that the money of his treasures failed, and that the tributes in the countrey were small, because of the dissention, and plagues that he had brought vpon the lande, in taking away the lawes which had bene of olde time,}"
72,3,30,"{\cf2 He feared least he shoulde not haue nowe at the seconde time, as the first, for the charges and gifts that he had giuen with a liberall hande afore: for in liberalitie he farre passed the other kings that were before him.}"
72,3,31,"{\cf2 Wherefore he was heauie in his minde, and thought to goe into Persia, for to take tributes of the countreys, and to gather much money.}"
72,3,32,"{\cf2 So he left Lysias a noble man & of the kings blood to ouersee the kings businesse, from the riuer of Euphrates vnto the borders of Egypt,}"
72,3,33,"{\cf2 And to bring vp his sonne Antiochus, till he came againe.}"
72,3,34,"{\cf2 Moreouer, he gaue him halfe of his host and elephants, & gaue him the charge of all things that he would haue done,}"
72,3,35,"{\cf2 And concerning those which dwelt in Iuda and Ierusalem, that he should send an army against them, to destroy and roote out the power of Israel and the remnant of Ierusalem, and to put out their memoriall from that place,}"
72,3,36,"{\cf2 And to set strangers for to inhabite all their quarters, and part their land among them.}"
72,3,37,"{\cf2 And the king tooke the halfe of the hoste that remained, and departed from Antiochia his royall citie, in the yeere an hundreth fourtie and seuen, and passed the riuer Euphrates, and went thorowe the hie countreys.}"
72,3,38,"{\cf2 Then Lysias chose Ptolemeus the sonne of Doriminus, and Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men, and the kings friends,}"
72,3,39,"{\cf2 And sent with them fourty thousand footemen, and seuen thousand horsemen, to go into the lande of Iuda, and to destroy it, as the king commanded.}"
72,3,40,"{\cf2 So they went forth with all their power, and came and pitched by Emmaus in the plaine countrey.}"
72,3,41,"{\cf2 Nowe when the marchants of the countrey heard the rumour of them, they tooke very much siluer and golde, and seruantes, and came into the campe to buy the children of Israel for slaues, and the strength of Syria and of strange nations ioyned with them.}"
72,3,42,"{\cf2 Nowe when Iudas and his brethren sawe that trouble increased, and that the hoste drewe neere vnto their borders, considering the kinges words, whereby he had commanded to destroy the people, and vtterly abolish them,}"
72,3,43,"{\cf2 They said one to another, Let vs redresse the decay of our people, and let vs fight for our people, and for our Sanctuarie.}"
72,3,44,"{\cf2 Then the Congregation were soone readie gathered to fight, and to pray, and to desire mercie and compassion.}"
72,3,45,"{\cf2 As for Ierusalem, it was not inhabited, but was as a wildernesse. There went none that was borne in it, in or out at it, and the Sanctuarie was troden downe, and the strangers kept the fortresse, and it was the habitation of the heathen: and the mirth of Iacob was taken away: the pipe and the harpe ceased.}"
72,3,46,"{\cf2 So they gathered them selues together, and came to Maspha before Ierusalem: for in Maspha was the place where they praied aforetime in Israel.}"
72,3,47,"{\cf2 And they fasted that day, and put sackcloth vpon them, and cast ashes vpon their heads, & rent their clothes,}"
72,3,48,"{\cf2 And opened the booke of the lawe, wherein the heathen sought to paynt the likenes of their idoles,}"
72,3,49,"{\cf2 And brought the Priestes garments, and the first fruites, and the tithes, and set there the Nazarites, which accomplished their dayes.}"
72,3,50,"{\cf2 And they cried with a loude voyce towarde heauen, saying, What shall wee doe with these? and whither shall we cary them away?}"
72,3,51,"{\cf2 For thy Sanctuarie is troden downe and defiled, and thy Priestes are in heauinesse, and brought downe.}"
72,3,52,"{\cf2 And beholde, the heathen are come against vs, to destroy vs: thou knowest what thinges they imagine against vs.}"
72,3,53,"{\cf2 How can we stand before them, except thou helpe vs?}"
72,3,54,"{\cf2 Then they blewe the trumpets, and cryed with a loude voyce.}"
72,3,55,"{\cf2 And after this Iudas ordeyned captaines ouer the people, euen captaines ouer thousands, and captaines ouer hundreths, and captaines ouer fifties, and captaines ouer tenne.}"
72,3,56,"{\cf2 And they commaunded them that buylded houses, or married wiues, or planted vineyardes, or were fearefull, that they shoulde returne euery one to his owne house, according to the Lawe.}"
72,3,57,"{\cf2 So the hoste remoued, and pitched vpon the Southside of Emmaus:}"
72,3,58,"{\cf2 And Iudas sayde, Arme your selues, and be valiant men, and be ready against the morning to fight with these nations, which are gathered together against vs, to destroy vs and our Sanctuarie.}"
72,3,59,"{\cf2 For it is better for vs to dye in battell, the to see the calamities of our people & of our Sactuary.}"
72,3,60,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse as the will of God is in heauen, so be it.}"
72,4,1,"{\cf2 Then tooke Gorgias fiue thousande foote men, and a thousande of the best horsemen, and departed out of the campe by night,}"
72,4,2,"{\cf2 To inuade the campe of the Iewes, and to slay them suddenly: and the men of the fortresse were his guides.}"
72,4,3,"{\cf2 Nowe when Iudas heard it, he remoued, and they that were valiant men to smite the Kings armie which was at Emmaus,}"
72,4,4,"{\cf2 Whiles yet the armie was dispersed from the campe.}"
72,4,5,"{\cf2 In the meane season came Gorgias by night into Iudas campe: and when he founde no man there, he sought them in the mountaines: for said he, They flee from vs.}"
72,4,6,"{\cf2 But assoone as it was day, Iudas shewed him selfe in the fielde with three thousand men, which had neither harnesse nor swordes to their mindes.}"
72,4,7,"{\cf2 And they saw that the armies of the heathen were strong and well armed, and their horsemen about them, & that these were expert men of warre.}"
72,4,8,"{\cf2 Then said Iudas to the men that were with him, Feare ye not their multitude, neither be afraid of their assault.}"
72,4,9,"{\cf2 Remember, howe our fathers were deliuered in the redde Sea, when Pharao pursued them with an armie.}"
72,4,10,"{\cf2 Therefore nowe let vs crie vnto heauen, and the Lorde wil haue mercie vpon vs, and remember the couenant of our fathers, and will destroy this hoste before our face this day:}"
72,4,11,"{\cf2 So shall all the heathen knowe, that there is one, which deliuereth and saueth Israel.}"
72,4,12,"{\cf2 Then the strangers lift vp their eyes, & sawe them comming against them,}"
72,4,13,"{\cf2 And they went out of their tentes into the battell, and they that were with Iudas, blewe the trumpets.}"
72,4,14,"{\cf2 So they ioyned together, and the heathen were discomfited and fled by the plaine.}"
72,4,15,"{\cf2 But the hinmost of them fel by the sword, & they pursued the vnto Gazeron, & into ye plaines of Idumea, & of Azotus, & of Iamnia, so that there were slaine of them about three thousande men.}"
72,4,16,"{\cf2 So Iudas turned againe with his hoste from pursuing them,}"
72,4,17,"{\cf2 And saide vnto the people, Be not greedy of the spoyles: for there is a battell before vs.}"
72,4,18,"{\cf2 And Gorgias and the armie is here by vs in the mountaine: but stand ye now fast against your enemies, and ouercome them: then may ye safely take the spoyles.}"
72,4,19,"{\cf2 As Iudas was speaking these words, there appeared one part which looked from ye mountaines.}"
72,4,20,"{\cf2 But when Gorgias sawe that his were fled, & that Iudas souldiers burnt the tents: (for the smoke that was seene, declared what was done.)}"
72,4,21,"{\cf2 When they saw these things, they were sore afraid, & when they saw also that Iudas & his hoste were in the field ready to set themselues in aray,}"
72,4,22,"{\cf2 They fled euery one into the lande of strangers.}"
72,4,23,"{\cf2 So Iudas turned againe to spoyle the tentes, where he gate much golde and siluer, and precious stones, and purple of the sea, and great riches.}"
72,4,24,"{\cf2 Thus they went home, & sung psalmes, and praysed toward the heauen: for he is gracious, and his mercy endureth for euer.}"
72,4,25,"{\cf2 And so Israel had great victory in that day.}"
72,4,26,"{\cf2 Nowe all the strangers that escaped, came, and tolde Lysias all the things that were done.}"
72,4,27,"{\cf2 Who when he heard these thinges, was sore afraid, & discouraged, because such things came not vpon Israel as he would, neither such things as the King had commanded him, came to passe.}"
72,4,28,"{\cf2 Therefore the next yere following, gathered Lysias three score thousande chosen foote men, and fiue thousand horsemen to fight against Ierusalem.}"
72,4,29,"{\cf2 So they came into Idumea, & pitched their tents at Beth-sura, where Iudas came against them with ten thousand men.}"
72,4,30,"{\cf2 And whe he saw that mightie armie, he praied, and saide, Blessed be thou, O Sauiour of Israel, which diddest destroy the assault of the mightie man by the hand of thy seruant Dauid, & gauest the hoste of the strangers into the hand of Ionathan, the sonne of Saul, and of his armour bearer:}"
72,4,31,"{\cf2 Shut vp this armie in the hand of thy people of Israel, & let them be confounded with their power, and with their horsemen.}"
72,4,32,"{\cf2 Make them afraide, and consume their boldnesse and strength, that they may be astonished at their destruction.}"
72,4,33,"{\cf2 Cast them downe by the sworde of them that loue thee: then shall all they that knowe thy Name, praise thee with songs.}"
72,4,34,"{\cf2 So they ioyned together, and there were slaine of Lysias hoste, fiue thousande men, and they fell before them.}"
72,4,35,"{\cf2 Then Lysias, seeing his armie put to flight, and the manlines of Iudas souldiers, and that they were ready, either to liue or die valiantly, he went into Antiochia, and gathered strangers, and when he had furnished his armie, he thought againe (being prepared) to come against Iudea.}"
72,4,36,"{\cf2 Then said Iudas and his brethren, Beholde, our enemies are discomfited: let vs nowe goe vp to clense, and to repaire the Sanctuarie.}"
72,4,37,"{\cf2 So all the hoste gathered them together, & went vp into the mountaine of Sion.}"
72,4,38,"{\cf2 Nowe when they sawe the Sanctuarie layde waste, and the altar defiled, and the doores burnt vp, and the shrubbes growing in the courtes, as in a forest, or as on one of the mountaines, and that the Priestes chambers were broken downe,}"
72,4,39,"{\cf2 They rent their clothes, and made great lamentation, and cast ashes vpon their heades,}"
72,4,40,"{\cf2 And fell downe to the ground on their faces, and blewe an alarme with the trumpets, and cryed toward heauen.}"
72,4,41,"{\cf2 Then Iudas commanded certaine of the me to fight against those which were in the castle, till he had clensed the Sanctuarie.}"
72,4,42,"{\cf2 So he chose Priestes that were vndefiled, such as delited in the Lawe,}"
72,4,43,"{\cf2 And they clensed the Sanctuarie, and bare out the defiled stones into an vncleane place,}"
72,4,44,"{\cf2 And consulted what to doe with the altar of burnt offrings, which was polluted.}"
72,4,45,"{\cf2 So they thought it was best to destroy it, least it shoulde be a reproche vnto them, because the heathen had defiled it: therefore they destroyed the altar,}"
72,4,46,"{\cf2 And layde vp the stones vpon the mountaine of the Temple in a conuenient place, til there should come a Prophet, to shewe what shoulde be done with them.}"
72,4,47,"{\cf2 So they tooke whole stones according to the Lawe, and builded a newe altar according to the former,}"
72,4,48,"{\cf2 And made vp the Sanctuarie, and the things that were within the Temple, and the courtes, and all things.}"
72,4,49,"{\cf2 They made also new holy vessels, & brought into the Temple the candlesticke, and the altar of burnt offrings, and of incense, and the table.}"
72,4,50,"{\cf2 And they burnt incense vpon the altar, and lighted the lampes which were vpon the candlesticke, that they might burne in the Temple.}"
72,4,51,"{\cf2 They set also the shewbread vpon the table, and hanged vp the vailes, & finished all the workes that they had begunne to make.}"
72,4,52,"{\cf2 And vpon the fiue and twentieth day of the ninth moneth, which is called the moneth of Chaslu, in the hundreth and eight and fourtieth yeere they rose vp betimes in the morning,}"
72,4,53,"{\cf2 And offred sacrifice according to the Lawe, vpon the new altar of burnt offrings, that they had made.}"
72,4,54,"{\cf2 According to the time, and according to the day, that the heathen had defiled it, in the same day was it made new with songs, and harpes, and lutes, and cymbales.}"
72,4,55,"{\cf2 And all the people fell vpon their faces, worshipping and praysing toward the heauen him that had giuen them good successe.}"
72,4,56,"{\cf2 So they kept the dedicatio of the altar eight dayes, offring burnt offrings with gladnesse, and offred sacrifices of deliuerance and prayse,}"
72,4,57,"{\cf2 And deckt the forefront of the Temple with crownes of golde and shieldes, and dedicated the gates & chambers, and hanged doores vpon them.}"
72,4,58,"{\cf2 Thus there was very great gladnesse among the people, and the reproche of the heathen was put away.}"
72,4,59,"{\cf2 So Iudas and his brethren with the whole congregation of Israel, ordeyned that the dayes of dedication of the altar should be kept in their season from veere to yere, by the space of eight dayes, from the fiue and twentieth day of the moneth Chaslu, with mirth and gladnesse.}"
72,4,60,"{\cf2 And at the same time buylded they vp mout Sion with hie walles, & strong towres round about, lest the Gentiles should come, and tread it downe, as they had done afore.}"
72,4,61,"{\cf2 Therefore they set a garrison there to keepe it, and fortified Beth-sura to keepe it, that the people might haue a defence against Idumea.}"
72,5,1,"{\cf2 Nowe when the nations rounde about heard, that the altar was buylded, and the Sanctuarie renued, as afore, they were sore grieued.}"
72,5,2,"{\cf2 Therefore they thought to destroy the generation of Iacob that was among them, and began to slay and destroy the people.}"
72,5,3,"{\cf2 Then Iudas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea at Arrabathene, because they besieged the Israelites, & he smote them with a great plague, and droue them to straites, and tooke their spoyles.}"
72,5,4,"{\cf2 He thought also vpon the malice of the children of Bean, which had bene a snare and an hinderance vnto the people, when they laye in wayte for them in the hie way.}"
72,5,5,"{\cf2 Wherefore he shut them vp in towers, and besieged them, and destroyed them vtterly, and burnt their towers with fire, with all that were in them.}"
72,5,6,"{\cf2 Afterwarde, went he against the children of Ammon, where he founde a mightie power, and a great multitude with Timotheus their captaine.}"
72,5,7,"{\cf2 So he had many battels with them, but they were destroyed before him, and so he discomfited them,}"
72,5,8,"{\cf2 And tooke Gazer with the townes thereof, and so turned againe into Iudea.}"
72,5,9,"{\cf2 Then the heathen that were in Galaad, gathered them together against the Israelites that were in their quarters, to slay them: but they fled to the castle of Datheman,}"
72,5,10,"{\cf2 And sent letters to Iudas, & to his brethren, saying, The heathen that are about vs, are gathered against vs, to destroy vs,}"
72,5,11,"{\cf2 And they make them ready for to come, and to take the fortresse, whereunto we are fledde, and Timotheus is captaine of their hoste.}"
72,5,12,"{\cf2 Come now therefore, and deliuer vs out of their handes: for many of vs are slaine:}"
72,5,13,"{\cf2 And all our brethren that were at Tubin, are slaine, and they haue taken away their wiues, and their children, and their goods, and destroyed there almost a thousand men.}"
72,5,14,"{\cf2 While these letters were yet a reading, beholde, there came other messengers from Galile with their clothes rent, which tolde ye same tidings,}"
72,5,15,"{\cf2 And said, that they of Ptolemais, & of Tyrus, and of Sidon, and of all Galile of the Gentiles were gathered against them to destroy them.}"
72,5,16,"{\cf2 When Iudas, and the people heard these wordes, a great congregation came together, to consulte what they might doe for their brethren, that were in trouble, and whom they besieged.}"
72,5,17,"{\cf2 Then said Iudas to Simon his brother, Chuse thee out men, and goe and deliuer thy brethren in Galile, and I and my brother Ionathan, wil goe into the countrey of Galaad.}"
72,5,18,"{\cf2 So he left Iosephus the sonne of Zacharias, and Azarias to be captaines of the people, and to keepe the remnant of the hoste in Iudea,}"
72,5,19,"{\cf2 And commanded them, saying, Take the ouersight of this people, and make no warre against the heathen, vntill we come againe.}"
72,5,20,"{\cf2 And vnto Simon were giuen three thousand men to goe into Galile, and to Iudas eight thousand men for the countrey of Galaad.}"
72,5,21,"{\cf2 Then went Simon into Galile, aad gaue diuers battels to the heathen, and the heathen were discomfited by him.}"
72,5,22,"{\cf2 And he pursued them vnto the gates of Ptolemais: & there were slaine of the heathen almost three thousand men: so he tooke their spoyles.}"
72,5,23,"{\cf2 Thus they reseued them that were in Galile and in Arbattis with their wiues, and their children, and all that they had, and brought them into Iudea with great ioy.}"
72,5,24,"{\cf2 Iudas Maccabeus also, and his brother Ionathan went ouer Iorden, and trauailed three dayes iourney in the wildernes,}"
72,5,25,"{\cf2 Where they mette with the Nabathites, who receiued them louingly, and tolde them euery thing that was done vnto their brethren in the countrey of Galaad,}"
72,5,26,"{\cf2 And how that many of them were besieged in Bosorra, and Bosor, in Alemis, Chasbon, Maged and Carnaim (all these cities are strong, and great)}"
72,5,27,"{\cf2 And that they were kept in other cities of Galaad, and to morow they are appointed to bring their hoste vnto these fortes, and to take them, and to destroy them all in one day.}"
72,5,28,"{\cf2 So Iudas and his host turned in all haste by the way of the wildernesse towarde Bosorra, and wanne the citie, and slewe all the males with the edge of the sword, and tooke all their spoyle, and set fire vpon the citie.}"
72,5,29,"{\cf2 And in the night he remooued from thence, and went toward the fortresse.}"
72,5,30,"{\cf2 And betimes in the morning when they looked vp, beholde, there was an innumerable people bearing ladders, and instruments of warre, to take the forte, and had assaulted them.}"
72,5,31,"{\cf2 When Iudas sawe that the battel was begun, & that the cry of the citie went vp to heauen with trumpets, and a great sound,}"
72,5,32,"{\cf2 Then he said vnto the armie, Fight this day for your brethren.}"
72,5,33,"{\cf2 So he went foorth behinde them with three companies, and they blewe the trumpets, and cryed with prayer.}"
72,5,34,"{\cf2 Then the host of Timotheus knew, that it was Maccabeus, and they fled from him, and hee smote them with a great slaughter, so that there was killed of them the same day, almost eight thousand men.}"
72,5,35,"{\cf2 Then departed Iudas vnto Maspha, & laid siege vnto it, and wanne it, and slewe all the males thereof, and spoyled it, and set fire vpon it.}"
72,5,36,"{\cf2 From thence went he and tooke Chasbon, Maged, and Bosor, and the other cities in Galaad.}"
72,5,37,"{\cf2 After these things gathered Timotheus another hoste, and he camped before Raphon beyond the flood.}"
72,5,38,"{\cf2 Now Iudas had sent to espie the host, and they brought him word againe, saying, All the heathen that bee rounde about vs, are gathered vnto him, and the host is very great,}"
72,5,39,"{\cf2 And hee hath hired the Arabians to helpe them, and they haue pitched their tents beyond the flood, and are ready to come and fight against thee. So Iudas went to meete them.}"
72,5,40,"{\cf2 Then Timotheus said vnto the captaines of his host, When Iudas and his host come neere the flood, if he passe ouer first vnto vs, we shal not be able to withstand him: for he wil be too strog for vs.}"
72,5,41,"{\cf2 But if he be afraide, and campe beyond the flood, we wil goe ouer vnto him, and shall preuaile against him.}"
72,5,42,"{\cf2 Now when Iudas came neere to ye flood, hee caused the gouernours of ye people to remayne by the flood, & commanded them, saying, Suffer none to pitch a tent, but let euery man come to ye battel.}"
72,5,43,"{\cf2 So he went first ouer toward them, & all the people after him: & all the heathen were discofited before him, and cast away their weapons, and fled into the Temple that was at Carnaim.}"
72,5,44,"{\cf2 Which citie Iudas wanne, and burnt the temple with all that were in it: so was Carnaim subdued, and might not withstand Iudas.}"
72,5,45,"{\cf2 Then Iudas gathered all the Israelites that were in the countrey of Galaad, from the least vnto the most, with their wiues and their children, and their baggage, a very great hoste, to come into the land of Iuda.}"
72,5,46,"{\cf2 So they came vnto Ephron, which was a great citie by the way, and strongly defensed: they coulde not passe, neither at the right hande nor at the left, but must goe thorow it.}"
72,5,47,"{\cf2 But they that were in the citie, shutte themselues in, & stopped vp the gates with stones: & Iudas sent vnto them with peaceable wordes, saying,}"
72,5,48,"{\cf2 Let vs passe thorowe your land, that we may goe into our owne countrey, and none shall hurt you: we will but onely goe thorowe on foote: but they would not open vnto him.}"
72,5,49,"{\cf2 Wherefore Iudas commaunded a proclamation to bee made throughout the hoste, that euery man should assault it according to his standing.}"
72,5,50,"{\cf2 So the valiant men set vpon it, and assaulted the citie all that day, and all that night, and the citie was giuen ouer into his handes:}"
72,5,51,"{\cf2 Who slew all the males with the edge of the sworde, and destroyed it, and tooke the spoile thereof, and went thorowe the citie ouer them that were slaine.}"
72,5,52,"{\cf2 Then went they ouer Iorden into the great plaine before Bethsan.}"
72,5,53,"{\cf2 And Iudas gathered together those that were behinde, & gaue the people good exhortation all the way thorow, til they were come into ye land of Iuda.}"
72,5,54,"{\cf2 Thus they went vp with ioye, and gladnesse vnto mount Sion, where they offred burnt offrings, because there were none of them slaine, but came home againe in safetie.}"
72,5,55,"{\cf2 Nowe whilest Iudas and Ionathan were in the land of Galaad, and Simon their brother in Galile before Ptolemais,}"
72,5,56,"{\cf2 Ioseph the sonne of Zacharias, and Azarias the captaines, hearing of the valiant actes, and battels which they had atchieued, said,}"
72,5,57,"{\cf2 Let vs get vs a name also, and go fight against the heathen that are round about vs.}"
72,5,58,"{\cf2 So they gaue their hoste a commaundement and went toward Iamnia.}"
72,5,59,"{\cf2 But Gorgias and his men came out of the citie to fight against them.}"
72,5,60,"{\cf2 And Ioseph and Azarias were put to flight, and pursued vnto the borders of Iudea: and there were slaine that day of the people of Israel about two thousand men: so that there was a great ouerthrow among the people of Israel,}"
72,5,61,"{\cf2 Because they were not obedient vnto Iudas, and his brethren, but thought to doe some valiant thing.}"
72,5,62,"{\cf2 Also they came not of ye stocke of these men, by whose handes deliuerance was giuen to Israel.}"
72,5,63,"{\cf2 But the man Iudas, & his brethre were greatly commended in the sight of all Israel, & of all the heathen, wheresoeuer their name was heard of.}"
72,5,64,"{\cf2 And the people came vnto them, bidding them welcome.}"
72,5,65,"{\cf2 Afterwarde went Iudas foorth with his brethren, and fought against the children of Esau in the land towarde the South, where hee wanne Hebron, & the townes thereof, and he destroyed the castel thereof, and burnt the towers thereof round about.}"
72,5,66,"{\cf2 Then remooued hee to goe into the lande of the strangers, and went thorowe Samaria.}"
72,5,67,"{\cf2 At the same time were the Priests of the cities slaine in the battel, which would shewe their valiantnes, and went forth to battel without counsell: and when Iudas came to Azotus in the strangers lande, he brake down their altars, and burnt with fire the images of their gods, and tooke away the spoyles of the cities, and came againe into the lande of Iuda.}"
72,6,1,"{\cf2 Now when King Antiochus traueyled thorowe the high countreys, hee heard that Elimais in the countrey of Persia was a citie greatly renowmed for riches, siluer and golde,}"
72,6,2,"{\cf2 And that there was in it a very riche temple, where as were couerings of golde, coate armours, and harnesse, which Alexander King of Macedonia the sonne of Philip (that reigned first in Grecia) had left there.}"
72,6,3,"{\cf2 Wherefore hee went about to take the citie, and to spoyle it, but he was not able: for the citizens were warned of the matter,}"
72,6,4,"{\cf2 And rose vp against him in battel, & hee fled and departed thence with great heauinesse, and came againe into Babylon.}"
72,6,5,"{\cf2 Moreouer, there came one which brought him tidings in the countrey of Persia, that the armies that went against the land of Iuda, were driuen away,}"
72,6,6,"{\cf2 And that Lysias, which went forth first with a great power, was driuen away of the Iewes, and that they were made strong by the armour, and power, and diuers spoyles which they had gotten of the armies whome they had destroyed,}"
72,6,7,"{\cf2 And that they had pulled downe the abomination, which he had set vp vpon the altar at Ierusalem, and fensed the Sanctuarie with high walles, as it was afore, and Beth-sura his citie.}"
72,6,8,"{\cf2 So when the king had heard these words, hee was astonished, and sore mooued: therefore hee laide him downe vpon his bed, and fell sicke for very sorowe, because it was not come to passe, as he had thought.}"
72,6,9,"{\cf2 And there continued hee many dayes: for his griefe was euer more and more, so that he sawe hee must needes die.}"
72,6,10,"{\cf2 Therefore he sent for all his friends, and said vnto them, The sleepe is gone from mine eyes, and mine heart fayleth for very care.}"
72,6,11,"{\cf2 And I thinke with my selfe, Into what aduersitie am I come? And into what flouds of miserie am I fallen now, whereas aforetime I was in prosperitie, and greatly set by, by reason of my power?}"
72,6,12,"{\cf2 And now doe I remember the euils that I haue done at Ierusalem: for I tooke all the vessels of golde and of siluer that were in it, and sent to destroy the inhabitants of Iuda without cause.}"
72,6,13,"{\cf2 I know that these troubles are come vpon me for the same cause, and behold, I must die with great sorow in a strange land.}"
72,6,14,"{\cf2 Then called he for Philip, one of his friends, whome he made ruler ouer all his realme,}"
72,6,15,"{\cf2 And gaue him the crowne, and his robe, and the ring, that he should instruct his sonne Antiochus, and bring him vp, till he might reigne himselfe.}"
72,6,16,"{\cf2 So king Antiochus died there in the hundreth, and fourtie and ninth yere.}"
72,6,17,"{\cf2 When Lysias knewe, that the king was dead, he ordeined Antiochus his sonne (whome hee had brought vp) to reigne in his fathers steade, and called him Eupator.}"
72,6,18,"{\cf2 Now they that were in the castell at Ierusalem, kept in the Israelites round about the Sanctuarie, and sought alwayes their hurt, and the strengthening of the heathen.}"
72,6,19,"{\cf2 Therefore Iudas thought to destroy them, and called all the people together to besiege them.}"
72,6,20,"{\cf2 So they came together and besieged them in the hundreth and fifty yeere, and made instruments to shoote and other engins of warre.}"
72,6,21,"{\cf2 But certaine of the that were besieged, gat foorth, (vnto whome some vngodly men of Israel ioyned themselues)}"
72,6,22,"{\cf2 And they went vnto the king, saying, Howe long wilt thou cease from executing iudgement, and auenge our brethren?}"
72,6,23,"{\cf2 We haue bene readie to serue thy father, & to goe forward in those things, that he appointed, and to obey his commandements.}"
72,6,24,"{\cf2 Therefore they of our nation fell from vs for this cause, and wheresoeuer they found any of vs, they slew them, and spoyled our inheritance.}"
72,6,25,"{\cf2 And they haue not onely laide hande vpon vs, but vpon all about their borders.}"
72,6,26,"{\cf2 And behold, this day are they besieging the castle at Ierusalem to take it, and haue fortified the Sanctuarie, and Beth-sura.}"
72,6,27,"{\cf2 And if thou doest not preuent them quickely, they will doe greater things then these, & thou shalt not be able to ouercome them.}"
72,6,28,"{\cf2 When the King heard this, hee was very angrie, and called all his friendes, the captaines of his armie, and his horsemen,}"
72,6,29,"{\cf2 And bandes that were hired, came vnto him from the Kinges, that were confederate, and from the yles of the sea.}"
72,6,30,"{\cf2 So the number of his armie was an hundreth thousande footemen, and twentie thousand horsemen, and two and thirtie elephantes excercised in battel.}"
72,6,31,"{\cf2 These came through Idumea and drew neere to Beth-sura, and besieged it a log season, and made engins of warre: but they came out, and burnt them with fire, and fought valiantly.}"
72,6,32,"{\cf2 Then departed Iudas from the castel, and remoued ye host toward Beth-zacarias ouer against the kings campe.}"
72,6,33,"{\cf2 So the King arose very earely, and brought the army & his power toward the way of Beth-zacarias, where the army set themselues in aray to the battel, and blewe the trumpets.}"
72,6,34,"{\cf2 And to prouoke the elephants for to fight, they shewed the the bloud of grapes & mulberies,}"
72,6,35,"{\cf2 And they set the beastes according to the ranges: so that by euery elephant there stoode a thousand men armed with coates of maile and helmets of brasse vpon their heades, and vnto euery beast were ordeined fiue hudreth horseme of ye best,}"
72,6,36,"{\cf2 Which were readie at all times wheresoeuer the beast was: and whethersoeuer the beast went, they went also, and departed not from him.}"
72,6,37,"{\cf2 And vpon them were strog towers of wood that couered euery beast, which were fastened thereon with instruments, and vpon euery one was twoand thirtie men that fought in them, and the Indian that ruled him.}"
72,6,38,"{\cf2 They set also the remnant of the horsemen vpon both the sides in two wings of the hoste, to stirre them vp, and to keepe them in the valleyes.}"
72,6,39,"{\cf2 And when the sunne shone vpon the golden shieldes, the mountaines glistered therewith, and gaue light as lampes of fire.}"
72,6,40,"{\cf2 Thus parte of the Kings armie was spred vpon the high mountaines, and part beneath: so they marched forward warily and in order.}"
72,6,41,"{\cf2 And all they that heard the noyse of their multitude, and the marching of the companie, and the ratling of the harnesse, were astonished: for the armie was very great and mightie.}"
72,6,42,"{\cf2 Then Iudas and his hoste entred into the battell, and they slewe sixe hundreth men of the Kings armie.}"
72,6,43,"{\cf2 Now when Eleazar, the sonne of Abaron, saw one of the elephants armed with royall harnes, and was more excellent then all the other beastes, he thought that the King should be vpon him.}"
72,6,44,"{\cf2 Wherefore he ieoparded him selfe to deliuer his people, and to get him a perpetuall name,}"
72,6,45,"{\cf2 And ran boldly vnto him through the mids of the hoste, slaying on the right hand, and on the left, so that they departed away on both sides.}"
72,6,46,"{\cf2 So went he to the elephants feete, and gate him vnder him, and slewe him: then fell the elephant downe vpon him, and there he dyed.}"
72,6,47,"{\cf2 But the other, seeing the power of the king & the fiercenesse of his armie, departed from them.}"
72,6,48,"{\cf2 And the Kings armie went vp to meete them towarde Ierusalem, and the King pitched his tents in Iudea towarde mount Sion.}"
72,6,49,"{\cf2 Moreouer, the King tooke truce with them that were in Beth-sura: but when they came out of the citie, because they had no vitailes there, and were shut vp therein, and the lande had rested,}"
72,6,50,"{\cf2 The King tooke Beth-sura, and set there a garison to keepe it,}"
72,6,51,"{\cf2 And besieged the Sanctuarie many dayes, and made instruments to shoote, and other engins of warre, and instruments to cast fire and stones, & pieces to cast dartes and slings.}"
72,6,52,"{\cf2 They also made engines against their engines, and fought a long season.}"
72,6,53,"{\cf2 But in the garners there were no vitailes: for it was the seuenth yeere, and then they that were in Iudea, and were deliuered from the Gentiles, had eaten vp the residue of the store,}"
72,6,54,"{\cf2 So that in the Sanctuarie were few men left: for the famine came so vpon them, that they were scattered euery man to his owne place.}"
72,6,55,"{\cf2 Nowe when Lysias heard that Philippe (whome Antiochus the King, whiles he liued, had ordeyned to bring vp Antiochus his sonne, that he might be King)}"
72,6,56,"{\cf2 Was come againe out of Persia and Media, and the Kings hoste with him, and thought to take vnto him the rule of things,}"
72,6,57,"{\cf2 He and his hasted, and were stirred forwarde by them in the castle to go and tell the King, and the captaines of the hoste, and to others, saying, We decrease daily, and our vitailes are but small: & the place that we lay siege vnto, is strong, and the affaires of the realme depende vpon vs.}"
72,6,58,"{\cf2 Now therefore let vs agree with these men, and take truce with them, and with al their nation,}"
72,6,59,"{\cf2 And graunt them to liue after their Lawe, as they did afore: for they be grieued, and doe all these things, because we haue broken their Lawes.}"
72,6,60,"{\cf2 So the King and the princes were content, and sent vnto them to make peace, and they receiued it.}"
72,6,61,"{\cf2 When the King and the princes had made an othe vnto them, they came vpon this out of the fortresse.}"
72,6,62,"{\cf2 And the King went vp to mount Sion: but when he sawe that the place was well defensed, he brake his othe that he had made, and commanded to breake downe the wall round about.}"
72,6,63,"{\cf2 Then departed he in all haste, and returned vnto Antiochia, where he found Philip hauing dominion of the citie: so he fought against him, and tooke the citie by force.}"
72,7,1,"{\cf2 In the hundreth, and one and fiftieth yeere, departed Demetrius the sonne of Seleucus from Rome, and came vp with a fewe men vnto a citie of the sea coast, and reigned there.}"
72,7,2,"{\cf2 And when he came into the possession of his fathers kingdome, his souldiers tooke Antiochus and Lysias, and brought them vnto him.}"
72,7,3,"{\cf2 But when it was tolde him, he said, Shew me not their faces.}"
72,7,4,"{\cf2 So they put them to death. Now when Demetrius was set vpon the throne of his kingdome,}"
72,7,5,"{\cf2 There came vnto him all the wicked and vngodly men of Israel, whose captaine was Alcimus, that would haue bene the hie Priest.}"
72,7,6,"{\cf2 These men accused the people vnto ye king, saying, Iudas and his brethren haue slaine all thy friendes, and driuen vs out of our owne lande.}"
72,7,7,"{\cf2 Wherefore sende nowe some man, whome thou trustest, that he may goe and see all the destruction, which he hath done vnto vs, and to the Kinges lande, and let him punish them with all their partakers.}"
72,7,8,"{\cf2 Then the King chose Bacchides a friende of his, which was a great man in the realme, and ruled beyond the flood, and was faithfull vnto the king, and sent him,}"
72,7,9,"{\cf2 And that wicked Alcimus, whome he made hie Priest, and commanded him to be auenged of the children of Israel.}"
72,7,10,"{\cf2 So they departed, and came with a great hoste into the land of Iuda, and sent messengers to Iudas and his brethren, deceitfully with peaceable wordes.}"
72,7,11,"{\cf2 But they beleeued not their saying: for they sawe that they were come with a great hoste.}"
72,7,12,"{\cf2 Then a company of the gouernours assembled vnto Alcimus and Bacchides to intreat of reasonable pointes.}"
72,7,13,"{\cf2 And the Asideans were the first that required peace among the children of Israel.}"
72,7,14,"{\cf2 For said they, He that is a Priest of the seede of Aaron, is come with this armie: therefore he will not hurt vs.}"
72,7,15,"{\cf2 Then he spake vnto them peaceably, and swore vnto them, and sayde, We will doe you no harme, neither your friendes:}"
72,7,16,"{\cf2 And they beleeued him: but he tooke of the three score men, and slewe them in one day according to the wordes that were written,}"
72,7,17,"{\cf2 They haue cast the bodyes of thy Saintes, and their blood rounde about Ierusalem, and there was no man that would burie them.}"
72,7,18,"{\cf2 So there came a feare and trembling among all the people: for they said, There is neither trueth nor righteousnesse in them: for they haue broken the appointment and othe that they made.}"
72,7,19,"{\cf2 Then Bacchides remoued from Ierusalem, and pitched his tent at Beth-zecha, where he sent foorth and tooke many of the men that had forsaken him, and certaine of the people whome hee slewe and cast into the great pit.}"
72,7,20,"{\cf2 Then committed he the countrey vnto Alcimus, and left men of warre with him to helpe him: so Bacchides went vnto the King.}"
72,7,21,"{\cf2 Thus Alcimus stroue for the Priesthoode.}"
72,7,22,"{\cf2 And all such as troubled the people, resorted vnto him: in so much, that they obteined the land of Iuda, and did much hurt in Israel.}"
72,7,23,"{\cf2 Nowe when Iudas sawe all the mischiefe, that Alcimus and his company had done among the Israelites more then the heathen,}"
72,7,24,"{\cf2 He went foorth rounde about all the borders of Iudea, and punished those that were fallen away, so that they came no more abroade in the countrey.}"
72,7,25,"{\cf2 But when Alcimus sawe that Iudas and his people had gotten the vpper hande, and knew that he was not able to abide them, he went againe to the King, and accused them of wicked things.}"
72,7,26,"{\cf2 Then the King sent Nicanor one of his chiefe princes, which hated Israel deadly, and commanded him, that he should destroy the people.}"
72,7,27,"{\cf2 So Nicanor came to Ierusalem with a great hoste, and sent vnto Iudas, and his brethren deceitfully with friendly wordes, saying,}"
72,7,28,"{\cf2 Let there be no warre betweene me, and you: I will come with fewe men, to see howe ye doe, friendly.}"
72,7,29,"{\cf2 So he came vnto Iudas, and they saluted one another peaceably: but the enemies were prepared to take away Iudas.}"
72,7,30,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse, it was tolde Iudas, that hee came vnto him vnder deceite: therefore he feared him, and woulde not see his face no more.}"
72,7,31,"{\cf2 When Nicanor perceiued that his counsell was bewrayed, he went out to fight against Iudas, beside Carphasalama.}"
72,7,32,"{\cf2 Where there were slaine of Nicanors hoste about fiue thousande men: so they fled vnto the citie of Dauid.}"
72,7,33,"{\cf2 After this came Nicanor vp vnto mount Sion, and some of the Priestes with the Elders of the people went foorth of the Sanctuarie to salute him peaceably, and to shewe him the burnt offring that was offred for the King.}"
72,7,34,"{\cf2 But he laughed at them, and mocked them, and counted them prophane, and spake proudly,}"
72,7,35,"{\cf2 And swore in his wrath, saying, If Iudas and his hoste be not deliuered nowe into mine handes, if euer I come againe in safetie, I will burne vp this house. With that, went he out in a great anger.}"
72,7,36,"{\cf2 Then the Priestes came in, and stoode before the altar in the Temple, weeping, and saying,}"
72,7,37,"{\cf2 For so much as thou, O Lorde, hast chosen this House, that thy Name might be called vpon therein, and that it should be an house of prayer, and petition for thy people,}"
72,7,38,"{\cf2 Be auenged of this man and his hoste, and let them be slaine by the sworde: remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue.}"
72,7,39,"{\cf2 When Nicanor was gone from Ierusalem, he pitched his tent at Beth-horon, and there an hoste met him out of Syria.}"
72,7,40,"{\cf2 And Iudas pitched in Adasa with three thousande men, where Iudas prayed, saying,}"
72,7,41,"{\cf2 O Lorde, because the messengers of King Sennacherib blasphemed thee, thine Angel went foorth, and slewe an hundreth, fourescore and fiue thousande of them.}"
72,7,42,"{\cf2 So destroy thou this hoste before vs to day, that all other may knowe that he hath spoken wickedly against thy Sanctuary, and punish him according to his malice.}"
72,7,43,"{\cf2 So the armies ioyned together in battell, the thirteenth day of the moneth Adar: but Nicanors hoste was discomfited, and he him selfe was first slaine in the battell.}"
72,7,44,"{\cf2 Nowe when his armie sawe that Nicanor was slaine, they cast away their weapons, and fled.}"
72,7,45,"{\cf2 But they pursued after them a dayes iourney from Adasa vnto Gasera, blowing an alarme with the trumpets after them.}"
72,7,46,"{\cf2 So they came foorth of all the townes of Iudea rounde about, and rushed vpon them, and threwe them from one to another, so that they all fell by the sworde, and there was not one of them left.}"
72,7,47,"{\cf2 Then they tooke the spoyles, and the pray, and smote off Nicanors head, and his right hande, which he helde vp so proudly, and brought it with them, and hanged them vp afore Ierusalem.}"
72,7,48,"{\cf2 So the people reioyced greatly, and kept that day as a day of great gladnesse.}"
72,7,49,"{\cf2 And they ordeined to keepe yeerely that day on the thirteenth day of the moneth Adar.}"
72,7,50,"{\cf2 Thus the lande of Iuda was in rest a litle while.}"
72,8,1,"{\cf2 Ivdas heard also the fame of the Romanes, that they were mightie, and valiant, and agreeable to all thinges that were required of them, and made peace with all that came vnto them,}"

72,9,1,"{\cf2 In the meane season when Demetrius had heard how Nicanor, and his hoste had giuen the battel, he sent Bacchides, and Alcimus againe into Iudea, and his chiefe strength with them.}"
72,9,2,"{\cf2 So they went forth by the way that is toward Galgala, and pitched their tentes before Mesaloth which is in Arbelis, and wanne it, and slewe much people.}"
72,9,3,"{\cf2 And in the first moneth of the hundreth, fifty and two yeere, they layed their siege against Ierusalem.}"
72,9,4,"{\cf2 But they raysed their campe, and came to Berea, with twentie thousand foote men and two thousand horsemen.}"
72,9,5,"{\cf2 Now Iudas had pitched his tent at Eleasa, and three thousand chosen men with him.}"
72,9,6,"{\cf2 And when they saw, that the multitude of the armie was great, they were sore afraid, & many conueied themselues out of the hoste, so that there abode no mo of them, but eight hundreth men.}"
72,9,7,"{\cf2 When Iudas saw that his host fayled him, and that he must needes fight, he was sore troubled in mind that he had no time to gather them together, and was discouraged.}"
72,9,8,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse, he saide vnto them that remained, Let vs rise, & go vp against our enemies, if peraduenture we may be able to fight with them.}"
72,9,9,"{\cf2 But they woulde haue stayed him, saying, We are not able: but let vs rather saue our liues: turne backe nowe, seeing our brethren are departed: for shall we fight against them, that are so fewe?}"
72,9,10,"{\cf2 Then Iudas said, God forbid, that we should doe this thing, to flie from them: if our time bee come, let vs die manfully for our brethren, and let vs not staine our honour.}"
72,9,11,"{\cf2 Then the host remooued out of the tents, & stood against the, who had deuided their horsemen into two troupes, & they that threwe with slinges, & the archers marched in the foreward, and they that fought in the foreward, were all valiant men.}"
72,9,12,"{\cf2 And Bacchides was in the right wing. So the armie drewe neere on both sides, and blewe the trumpets.}"
72,9,13,"{\cf2 They of Iudas side blewe the trumpets also, and the earth shooke at the noyse of the armies, & the battel continued from morning to night.}"
72,9,14,"{\cf2 And when Iudas sawe that Bacchides & the strength of his armie was on ye right side, he tooke with him all the hardie men,}"
72,9,15,"{\cf2 And brake the right wing, & followed vpon them vnto mount Azotus.}"
72,9,16,"{\cf2 Nowe when they which were of the left wing, sawe that the right wing was discomfited, they followed Iudas behinde, and them that were with him hard at the heeles.}"
72,9,17,"{\cf2 Then was there a sore battel: for many were slaine of both the parties.}"
72,9,18,"{\cf2 Iudas also himselfe was killed, and the remnant fled.}"

72,9,20,"{\cf2 And al the Israelites wept for him, & mourned greatly for him, & lameted many dayes, saying,}"
72,9,21,"{\cf2 How is the valiant man fallen which deliuered Israel!}"
72,9,22,"{\cf2 Concerning the other things of Iudas, both the battels and the valiant actes that hee did, and of his worthines, they are not writte: for they were verie many.}"
72,9,23,"{\cf2 Now after the death of Iudas, wicked men came vp in all the coastes of Israel, and there arose all such as gaue themselues to iniquitie.}"
72,9,24,"{\cf2 In those dayes was there a very great famine in the lande, and all the countrey gaue ouer themselues with them.}"
72,9,25,"{\cf2 And Bacchides did chuse wicked men, and made them lords in the land.}"
72,9,26,"{\cf2 These sought out, and made search for Iudas friends, & brought the vnto Bacchides, which auenged himselfe vpon them, and mocked them.}"
72,9,27,"{\cf2 And there came so great trouble in Israel, as was not since the time that no Prophet was seene among them.}"
72,9,28,"{\cf2 Then came all Iudas friendes together, and saide vnto Ionathan,}"
72,9,29,"{\cf2 Seeing thy brother Iudas is dead, and there is none like him to goe forth against our enemies, euen against Bacchides, and against them of our nation that are enemies vnto vs,}"
72,9,30,"{\cf2 Therefore, this day we chuse thee, that thou mayest be our Prince & captaine in his place, to order our battell.}"
72,9,31,"{\cf2 So Ionathan tooke the gouernance vpon him at the same time, and ruled in stead of his brother Iudas.}"
72,9,32,"{\cf2 But when Bacchides knewe it, he sought for to slay him.}"
72,9,33,"{\cf2 Then Ionathan and Simon his brother, perceiuing that, fled into the wildernes of Thecua with all their companie, and pitched their tents by the water poole of Asphar.}"
72,9,34,"{\cf2 Which when Bacchides vnderstoode, hee came ouer Iorden with all his hoste vpon the Sabbath day.}"
72,9,35,"{\cf2 (Nowe had Ionathan sent his brother Iohn, a captaine of the people, to pray his friendes the Nabathites, that they would keepe their baggage which was much.}"
72,9,36,"{\cf2 But the children of Ambri came out of Medaba, and tooke Iohn, and al that he had, and when they had taken it, went their way.}"
72,9,37,"{\cf2 After this came worde vnto Ionathan, and to Simon his brother, that the children of Ambri made a great marriage, and brought the bride from Medaba with great pompe: for she was daughter to one of the noblest Princes of Canaan.}"
72,9,38,"{\cf2 Therefore they remembred Iohn their brother, and went vp, and hid themselues vnder the couert of the mountaine.}"
72,9,39,"{\cf2 So they lift vp their eyes, and looked, and beholde, there was a great noyse, and much preparation: then the bridegrome came forth, and his friends and his brethre met them with tymbrels, & instruments of musike, and many weapons.}"
72,9,40,"{\cf2 The Ionathans men that lay in ambush, rose vp against them, and slewe many of them, and the remnant fledde into the mountaines, so that they tooke all their spoyles.}"
72,9,41,"{\cf2 Thus the marriage was turned to mourning, and the noyse of their melodie into lamentation.}"
72,9,42,"{\cf2 And so when they had auenged the blood of their brother, they turned againe vnto Iorden.}"
72,9,43,"{\cf2 When Bacchides heard this, hee came vnto the border of Iorden with a great power vpon the Sabbath day.)}"
72,9,44,"{\cf2 Then Ionathan saide vnto his companie, Let vs rise nowe, and fight against our enemies: for it is not to day as in time past.}"
72,9,45,"{\cf2 Beholde, the battel is before vs, and behinde vs, and the water of Iorden on this side and that side, and the marise, and forest, so that there is no place for vs to turne aside.}"
72,9,46,"{\cf2 Wherefore crie nowe vnto heauen, that yee may be deliuered from the power of your enemies: so they ioyned battell.}"
72,9,47,"{\cf2 Then Ionathan stretched out his hande to smite Bacchides: but hee turned aside from him & reculed.}"
72,9,48,"{\cf2 Then Ionathan, & they that were with him, leapt into Iorden, and swimmed ouer vnto the further banke: but the other would not passe through Iorden after them.}"
72,9,49,"{\cf2 So in that day were slaine of Bacchides side about a thousand men.}"
72,9,50,"{\cf2 Then hee turned againe to Ierusalem, and buylt vp the strong cities in Iuda, as the castell of Iericho, and Emmaus, and Bethhoron, and Bethel, and Thamnatha, Pharathoni, & Tepho, with high walles, with gates, and with barres,}"
72,9,51,"{\cf2 And set Garisons in them, that they might vse their malice vpon Israel.}"
72,9,52,"{\cf2 He fortified also the citie Beth-sura, and Gazara, and the castel, and set a garison in them with prouision of vitailes.}"
72,9,53,"{\cf2 Hee tooke also the chiefest mens sonnes in the countrey for hostages, and put them in the castell at Ierusalem to be kept.}"
72,9,54,"{\cf2 Afterward in the hundreth, fiftie & three yere, in the second moneth, Alcimus commaunded, that the walles of the inner court of the Sanctuary should be destroyed, & he pulled downe the monuments of ye Prophetes, & began to destroy them.}"
72,9,55,"{\cf2 But at the same time Alcimus was plagued, and his enterprises were hindered, and his mouth was stopped: for he was smitten with a palsie, and could no more speake, nor giue order concerning his house.}"
72,9,56,"{\cf2 Thus dyed Alcimus with great torment at the same time.}"
72,9,57,"{\cf2 And when Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he turned againe to the King, and so the land of Iuda was in rest two yeeres.}"
72,9,58,"{\cf2 Then all the vngodly men helde a counsell, saying, Behold, Ionathan and his companie dwell at ease, and without care: wherefore let vs bring Bacchides hither, and he wil take them all in one night.}"
72,9,59,"{\cf2 So they went and consulted with him.}"
72,9,60,"{\cf2 Who arose and came with a great hoste, and sent letters priuily to his adherents, which were in Iudea, to take Ionathan and those that were with him: but they coulde not, for their counsell was knowen vnto them.}"
72,9,61,"{\cf2 And they tooke fiftie men of the countrey, which were the chiefe workers of this wickednesse, and slewe them.}"
72,9,62,"{\cf2 Then Ionathan and Simon with their companie departed vnto Beth-basin which is in the wildernes, and repaired the decay thereof, and made it strong.}"
72,9,63,"{\cf2 When Bacchides knewe this, he gathered all his hoste, & sent word to them that were of Iudea.}"
72,9,64,"{\cf2 Then came he and layd siege to Beth-basin, and fought against it a long season, and made instruments of warre.}"
72,9,65,"{\cf2 But Ionathan had left his brother Simon in the citie, and went foorth into the countrey, and came with a certaine nomber,}"
72,9,66,"{\cf2 And slewe Odomeras and his brethren and the children of Phasiron in their tentes: so hee began to slay, and increased in power.}"
72,9,67,"{\cf2 Simon also and his companie went out of the citie, and burnt vp the instruments of warre,}"
72,9,68,"{\cf2 And fought against Bacchides, and discomfited him, and vexed him sore, so that his counsell and iourney was in vaine.}"
72,9,69,"{\cf2 Wherefore he was very wroth at the wicked men, that gaue him counsel to come into the countrey, and slewe many of them, and purposed to returne into his owne countrey.}"
72,9,70,"{\cf2 Whereof when Ionathan had knowledge, he sent Ambassadours vnto him, to intreate of peace with him, & that the prisoners should be deliuered.}"
72,9,71,"{\cf2 Which thing he accepted, and did according to his desire, and made an othe, that he would neuer doe him harme all the dayes of his life.}"
72,9,72,"{\cf2 So he restored vnto him the prisoners that he had taken aforetime out of the land of Iuda, and so returned and went into his owne lande, neither did he come any more into their borders.}"
72,9,73,"{\cf2 Thus the sworde ceased from Israel, and Ionathan dwelt at Machmas, and began there to gouerne the people, and destroyed the vngodly men out of Israel.}"
72,10,1,"{\cf2 In the hundreth and three score yeere came Alexander the sonne of Antiochus Epiphanes, and tooke Ptolemais, and they receiued him, and there he reigned.}"
72,10,2,"{\cf2 Nowe when Demetrius the King heard it, he gathered an exceeding great hoste, and went foorth against him to fight.}"
72,10,3,"{\cf2 Also Demetrius sent letters vnto Ionathan, with louing words, as though he would preferre him.}"
72,10,4,"{\cf2 For he saide, Wee will first make peace with him, before he ioyne with Alexander against vs.}"
72,10,5,"{\cf2 Els hee will remember all the euill that wee haue done against him, and against his brethren and his nation.}"
72,10,6,"{\cf2 And so he gaue Ionathan leaue to gather an hoste, and to prepare weapons, and to be confederate with him, and commaunded the hostages that were in the castell, to be deliuered vnto him.}"
72,10,7,"{\cf2 Then came Ionathan to Ierusalem, and read the letters in the audience of all the people, and of them that were in the castell.}"
72,10,8,"{\cf2 Therefore they were sore afraide, because they heard that the King had giuen him licence to gather an armie.}"
72,10,9,"{\cf2 So they that were of the castell, deliuered the hostages vnto Ionathan, who restored them to their parents.}"
72,10,10,"{\cf2 Ionathan also dwelt at Ierusalem, and began to builde, and repaire the citie.}"
72,10,11,"{\cf2 And he commanded the workemen to build the walles, and the mount Sion rounde about with hewen stone, to fortifie it: and so they did.}"
72,10,12,"{\cf2 Then the strangers that were in the castles which Bacchides had made, fled,}"
72,10,13,"{\cf2 So that euery man left his place, and went into his owne countrey.}"
72,10,14,"{\cf2 Onely at Beth-sura remained certaine which had forsaken the Lawe and the commaundements: for it was their refuge.}"
72,10,15,"{\cf2 Nowe when King Alexander had heard of the promises that Demetrius had made vnto Ionathan: and when it was tolde him of the battels and noble actes, which hee and his brethren had done, and of the paines that they had endured,}"
72,10,16,"{\cf2 He said, Might we find such a man? Now therefore we will make him our friend and confederate.}"
72,10,17,"{\cf2 Vpon this hee wrote a letter, and sent it vnto him, with these wordes, saying,}"
72,10,18,"{\cf2 King Alexander to his brother Ionathan sendeth salutation.}"
72,10,19,"{\cf2 Wee haue heard of thee, that thou art a very valiant man, and worthy to be our friend.}"
72,10,20,"{\cf2 Wherefore this day we ordaine thee to bee the hie Priest of thy nation, and to bee called the Kings friende: (and he sent him a purple robe, and a crowne of golde,) that thou mayst consider what is for our profite, and keepe friendship toward vs.}"
72,10,21,"{\cf2 So in the seuenth moneth of the hundreth and three score yeere, vpon the feast day of the tabernacles, Ionathan put on the holy garment, and gathered an hoste, and prepared many weapons.}"
72,10,22,"{\cf2 Which when Demetrius heard, he was marueilous sory, and said,}"
72,10,23,"{\cf2 What haue wee done, that Alexander hath preuented vs in getting the friendship of the Iewes for his strength?}"
72,10,24,"{\cf2 Yet will I write and exhort them, and promise them dignities and rewardes, that they may helpe mee.}"
72,10,25,"{\cf2 Whereupon he wrote vnto them these words, King Demetrivs vnto the nations of the Iewes sendeth greeting.}"
72,10,26,"{\cf2 Wee haue heard that ye haue kept your couenant toward vs, and continued in our friendship, and haue not ioyned with our enemies, whereof we are glad.}"
72,10,27,"{\cf2 Nowe therefore remaine stil, and keepe fidelitie toward vs, and we will recompence you for the good things that ye haue done for vs,}"
72,10,28,"{\cf2 And will release you of many charges, and giue you rewards.}"
72,10,29,"{\cf2 And nowe I discharge for your sake all the Iewes from tributes, and free you from the customes of salt, and the crowne taxes, and from the thirde part of the seede.}"
72,10,30,"{\cf2 And from the halfe of the fruite of the trees which is mine owne duetie, I so release them that from this day foorth, none shall take any thing of the land of Iuda, or of the three gouernments which are added thereunto, as of Samaria and of Galile, from this day foorth for euermore.}"
72,10,31,"{\cf2 Ierusalem also with all things beloging thereto, shalbe holy and free from the tenths & tributes.}"
72,10,32,"{\cf2 Also I release the power of the castel which is at Ierusalem, and giue it vnto the hie Priest, that he may set in it such men, as he shall chuse to keepe it.}"
72,10,33,"{\cf2 Moreouer I freely deliuer euery one of ye Iewes that were taken away prisoners out of the lande of Iuda throughout all my realme, and euery one of them shalbe free from tributes, yea, eue their cattel,}"
72,10,34,"{\cf2 And all the feastes, and Sabbaths, and newe Moones, and the dayes appointed & the three dayes before the feast, and the three dayes after the feast, shall be dayes of freedome and libertie for all the Iewes in my realme,}"
72,10,35,"{\cf2 So that in them no man shall haue power to doe any thing, or to vexe any of them in any maner of cause.}"
72,10,36,"{\cf2 Also thirtie thousande of the Iewes shall be written vp in the Kings hoste, and haue their wages payed them as appertaineth to all them that are of the Kings armie: and of them shall be ordeined certaine to keepe the Kings strong holdes.}"
72,10,37,"{\cf2 And some of them shalbe set ouer the Kings most secret affaires, and their gouernours and their Princes shalbe of themselues, and they shall liue after their owne lawes, as the King hath commaunded in the land of Iuda.}"
72,10,38,"{\cf2 And the three gouernements that are added vnto Iudea from the countrey of Samaria, shall be ioyned vnto Iudea, and they shall be as vnder one, and obey none other power, but the hie Priest.}"
72,10,39,"{\cf2 And I giue Ptolemais and the borders thereof vnto the Sanctuarie at Ierusalem, for the necessarie expenses of the holy things.}"
72,10,40,"{\cf2 Moreouer, I will giue euery yeere fifteene thousand sicles of siluer of the Kings reuenues out of the places appertaining vnto me.}"
72,10,41,"{\cf2 And all the ouerplus which they haue not payed for the things due, as they did in the former yeeres, from hencefoorth they shall giue it towarde the workes of the Temple.}"
72,10,42,"{\cf2 And besides this, the fiue thousande sicles of siluer which they receiued yeerely of the account appointed for the interteinment of the Sanctuarie these yeeres passed, euen these things shalbe released because they apperteine to the Priests that minister.}"
72,10,43,"{\cf2 Item, whosoeuer they bee that flee vnto the Temple at Ierusalem, or within the liberties thereof, and are indetted to the King for any maner of thing, they shall be pardoned, and all that they haue in my realme.}"
72,10,44,"{\cf2 For the building also and repairing of the workes of the Sanctuarie, expenses shall be giuen of the Kings reuenues.}"
72,10,45,"{\cf2 And for the making of the walles of Ierusalem, and fortifying it rounde about, that the holdes in Iudea may be built vp, shall also the costes be giuen out of the Kings reuenues.}"
72,10,46,"{\cf2 But when Ionathan and the people heard these words, they gaue no credit vnto them, neither receiued them: for they remembred the great wickednesse that he had done in Israel, and how sore he had vexed them.}"
72,10,47,"{\cf2 Wherefore they agreed vnto Alexander: for he was the first that had intreated of true peace with them, and so were confederate with him always.}"
72,10,48,"{\cf2 Then gathered King Alexander a great hoste, and camped ouer against Demetrius.}"
72,10,49,"{\cf2 So the two Kings ioyned battell, but Demetrius hoste fled, and Alexander pursued him, and preuailed against them.}"
72,10,50,"{\cf2 So that sore battell continued till the sunne went downe, & Demetrius was slaine the same day.}"
72,10,51,"{\cf2 Then Alexander sent Ambassadours vnto Ptolemeus the King of Egypt with these words, saying,}"
72,10,52,"{\cf2 For so much as I am come againe to my realme, and am set in the throne of my fathers, and haue gotten the dominion, and haue destroyed Demetrius, and enioy my countrey,}"
72,10,53,"{\cf2 Seeing that I haue euen giuen him the battel, and he and his armie is discomfited by me, and I sit in the throne of his kingdome,}"
72,10,54,"{\cf2 Let vs nowe make friendship together, and giue me now thy daughter to wife: so shall I be thy sonne in lawe, and giue thee rewardes, and vnto her things according to thy dignitie.}"
72,10,55,"{\cf2 Then Ptolemeus the King gaue answere, saying, Happie bee the day, wherein thou art come againe vnto the land of thy fathers, and sittest in the throne of their kingdome.}"
72,10,56,"{\cf2 Nowe therefore will I fulfill thy writing: but meete mee at Ptolemais that wee may see one another, and that I may make thee my sonne in lawe, according to thy desire.}"
72,10,57,"{\cf2 So Ptolemeus went out of Egypt with his daughter Cleopatra, and came vnto Ptolemais in the hundreth threescore and two yeere,}"
72,10,58,"{\cf2 Where King Alexander met him, and he gaue vnto him his daughter Cleopatra, and marryed them at Ptolemais with great glorie, as the maner of Kings is.}"
72,10,59,"{\cf2 Then wrote King Alexander vnto Ionathan, that he should come and meete him.}"
72,10,60,"{\cf2 So he went honourably vnto Ptolemais, and there hee met the two Kings, and gaue them great presents of siluer and golde, and to their friends, and found fauour in their sight.}"
72,10,61,"{\cf2 And there assembled certaine pestilent fellowes of Israel, and wicked men to accuse him: but the King would not heare them.}"
72,10,62,"{\cf2 And the King commanded that they should take off the garments of Ionathan, and clothe him in purple: and so they did: and the King appointed him to sit by him,}"
72,10,63,"{\cf2 And saide vnto his Princes, Goe with him into the middes of the citie, and make a proclamation, that no man complaine against him of any matter, and that no man trouble him for any maner of cause.}"
72,10,64,"{\cf2 So when his accusers sawe his honour according as it was proclaimed, and that he was clothed in purple, they fled all away.}"
72,10,65,"{\cf2 And the King preferred him to honour, and wrote him among his chiefe friends, and made him a Duke, and partaker of his dominion.}"
72,10,66,"{\cf2 Thus Ionathan returned to Ierusalem with peace and gladnesse.}"
72,10,67,"{\cf2 In the hundreth, threescore and fiue yeere came Demetrius the sonne of Demetrius, from Creta into his fathers land.}"
72,10,68,"{\cf2 Whereof when King Alexander heard, hee was very sorie, and returned vnto Antiochia.}"
72,10,69,"{\cf2 Then Demetrius appointed Apollonius thegouernour of Coelosyria, who gathered a great hoste, and camped in Iamnia, and sent vnto Ionathan the hie Priest, saying,}"
72,10,70,"{\cf2 Darest thou, being but alone, lift vp thy selfe against vs? and I am laughed at, and reproched, because of thee: nowe therefore why doest thou vaunt thy selfe against vs in the mountaines?}"
72,10,71,"{\cf2 Nowe then if thou trust in thine owne strength, come downe to vs into the plaine fielde, and there let vs trie the matter together: for I haue the strength of cities.}"
72,10,72,"{\cf2 Aske and learne who I am, and they shall take my part: and they shall tell thee that your foote is not able to stand before our face: for thy fathers haue bene twise chased in their owne land.}"
72,10,73,"{\cf2 And now how wilt thou be able to abide so great an hoste of horsemen and footemen in the plaine, where is neither stone, nor rocke, nor place to flee vnto?}"
72,10,74,"{\cf2 When Ionathan heard the wordes of Apollonius, he was moued in his minde: wherefore hee chose ten thousand men, & went out of Ierusalem, and Simon his brother met him for to helpe him.}"
72,10,75,"{\cf2 And he pitched his tentes at Ioppe: but they shut him out of the citie: for Apollonius garison was in Ioppe.}"
72,10,76,"{\cf2 Then they fought against it, and they that were in the citie, for very feare let him in: so Ionathan wanne Ioppe.}"
72,10,77,"{\cf2 Apollonius hearing of this, tooke three thousand horsemen with a great hoste of foote men, and went toward Azotus, as though he would go forward, and came immediatly into the plaine fielde, because he had so many horsemen, and put his trust in them.}"
72,10,78,"{\cf2 So Ionathan followed vpon him to Azotus, and the armie skirmished with his arriere band.}"
72,10,79,"{\cf2 For Apollonius had left a thousand horsmen behinde them in ambush.}"
72,10,80,"{\cf2 And Ionathan knew that there was an ambushment behinde him, and though they had compassed in his hoste, and shot dartes at the people from the morning to the euening,}"
72,10,81,"{\cf2 Yet the people stood still, as Ionathan had commanded them, till their horses were wearie.}"
72,10,82,"{\cf2 Then brought Simon foorth his hoste, and set them against the band: but the horses were weary, and he discomfited them, and they fled: so the horsemen were scattered in the fielde,}"
72,10,83,"{\cf2 And they fled to Azotus, and came into the temple of Dagon their idole, that they might there saue them selues.}"
72,10,84,"{\cf2 But Ionathan set fire vpon Azotus and all the cities round about it, and tooke their spoyles, and burnt with fire the temple of Dagon with all them that were fled into it.}"
72,10,85,"{\cf2 Thus were slaine and burnt about eight thousand men.}"
72,10,86,"{\cf2 So Ionathan remooued the hoste from thence, and camped by Ascalon, where the men of the citie came foorth, and met him with great honour.}"
72,10,87,"{\cf2 After this went Ionathan and his hoste againe to Ierusalem with great spoyles.}"
72,10,88,"{\cf2 And when King Alexander heard these things, he began to doe Ionathan more honour,}"
72,10,89,"{\cf2 And sent him a coller of golde, as the vse is to be giuen vnto such as are of the Kings blood: he gaue him also Accaron, with the borders thereof in possession.}"
72,11,1,"{\cf2 And the king of Egypt gathered a great hoste, like the sande that lieth vpon the sea shore, and many shippes, and went about through deceite to obtaine the kingdome of Alexander, and to ioyne it vnto his owne Realme.}"
72,11,2,"{\cf2 Vpon this he went into Syria with friendly wordes, and was let into the cities, and men came foorth to meete him: for king Alexander had commanded them to meete him, because hee was his father in lawe.}"
72,11,3,"{\cf2 Now when he entred into the citie of Ptolemais, he left bands and garisons in euery citie.}"
72,11,4,"{\cf2 And when he came neere to Azotus, they shewed him the temple of Dagon that was burnt, and Azotus, and the suburbs thereof that were destroyed, and the bodies cast abroad, and them that hee had burnt in the battell: for they had made heapes of them by the way where he should passe.}"
72,11,5,"{\cf2 And they tolde the king what Ionathan had done, to the intent they might get him euill will: but the King helde his peace.}"
72,11,6,"{\cf2 And Ionathan met the king with great honour at Ioppe, where they saluted one another, and lay there.}"
72,11,7,"{\cf2 So when Ionathan had gone with the king vnto the water that was called Eleutherus, hee turned againe to Ierusalem.}"
72,11,8,"{\cf2 So King Potolemeus gate the dominion of the cities by the sea vnto Seleucia vpon ye sea coast, imagining wicked counsels against Alexander,}"
72,11,9,"{\cf2 And sent Ambassadours vnto King Demetrius, saying, Come, let vs make a league betweene vs, and I wil giue thee my daughter, which Alexander hath, and thou shalt reigne in thy fathers kingdome.}"
72,11,10,"{\cf2 For I repent that I gaue Alexander my daughter: for he goeth about to slay me.}"
72,11,11,"{\cf2 Thus he slandered Alexander, as one that should desire his Realme.}"
72,11,12,"{\cf2 And he tooke his daughter from him, and gaue her vnto Demetrius, and forsooke Alexander, so that their hatred was openly knowen.}"
72,11,13,"{\cf2 Then Ptolemeus came to Antiochia, where he set two crownes vpon his owne head, of Asia and of Egypt.}"
72,11,14,"{\cf2 In the meane season was King Alexander in Cilicia: for they that dwelt in those places, had rebelled against him:}"
72,11,15,"{\cf2 But when Alexander heard it, he came to warre against him, and Ptolemeus brought foorth his hoste, and met him with a mightie power, and put him to flight.}"
72,11,16,"{\cf2 Then fled Alexander into Arabia, there to be defended: so Ptolemeus was exalted.}"
72,11,17,"{\cf2 And Zabdiel the Arabian smote off Alexanders head, and sent it vnto Ptolemeus.}"
72,11,18,"{\cf2 But the third day after, King Ptolemeus dyed: and they that were in the holdes, were slaine one of another.}"
72,11,19,"{\cf2 And Demetrius reigned in the hundreth, threescore and seuenth yeere.}"
72,11,20,"{\cf2 At the same time gathered Ionathan them that were in Iudea, to lay siege vnto ye castell, which was at Ierusalem, and they made many instruments of warre against it.}"
72,11,21,"{\cf2 Then went there certaine vngodly persons (which hated their owne people) vnto King Demetrius, and tolde him that Ionathan besieged the castell.}"
72,11,22,"{\cf2 So when he heard it, he was angry, and immediatly came vnto Ptolemais, and wrote vnto Ionathan, that he should lay no more siege vnto it, but that he should meete him and speake with him at Ptolemais in all haste.}"
72,11,23,"{\cf2 Neuertheles when Ionathan heard this, hee commanded to besiege it: he chose also certaine of the Elders of Israel, and the Priests, and put himselfe in danger,}"
72,11,24,"{\cf2 And tooke with him siluer and golde, and apparell, and diuers presents, and went to Ptolemais vnto the King, and found fauour in his sight.}"
72,11,25,"{\cf2 And though certaine vngodly men of his owne nation had made complaints vpon him,}"
72,11,26,"{\cf2 Yet the King intreated him as his predecessours had done, and promoted him in the sight of all his friends,}"
72,11,27,"{\cf2 And confirmed him in the hie priesthood with all the honourable things, that hee had afore, and made him his chiefe friend.}"
72,11,28,"{\cf2 Ionathan also desired the King, that hee would make Iudea free with the three gouernements, and the countrey of Samaria, and Ionathan promised him three hundreth talents.}"
72,11,29,"{\cf2 Whereunto the King consented, and gaue Ionathan writing of the same, conteining these wordes,}"
72,11,30,"{\cf2 King Demetrivs vnto his brother Ionathan, and to the nation of the Iewes sendeth greeting.}"
72,11,31,"{\cf2 We send you here a copy of the letter which we did write vnto our cousin Lasthenes concerning you, that ye should see it.}"
72,11,32,"{\cf2 King Demetrius vnto Lasthenes his father sendeth greeting.}"
72,11,33,"{\cf2 For the faithfulnes that our friends the nation of the Iewes keepe vnto vs, and for their good wil towards vs, we are determined to do them good.}"
72,11,34,"{\cf2 Wherefore we assigne to them the coasts of Iudea with the three gouernments Apherema, and Lydda, and Ramathe (which are added vnto Iudea from the countrey of Samaria) and all that appertaineth to all them that sacrifice in Ierusalem: both concerning the paiments which the King tooke yeerely aforetime, both for the fruites of the earth, and for the fruites of the trees.}"
72,11,35,"{\cf2 As for the other things appertaining vnto vs of the tenthes and tributes, which were due vnto vs, and the customes of salte, and crowne taxes, which were payed vnto vs, we discharge them of all from hencefoorth.}"
72,11,36,"{\cf2 And nothing hereof shall be reuoked from this time forth and for euer.}"
72,11,37,"{\cf2 Therefore see that ye make a copy of these things, and deliuer it vnto Ionathan, that it may be set vp vpon the holy mount in an open place.}"
72,11,38,"{\cf2 After this when Demetrius the King sawe that his land was in rest, and that no resistance was made against him, he sent away all his hoste, euery man to his owne place, except certaine bands of strangers, whome he brought from the yles of the heathen: wherefore all his fathers hoste hated him.}"
72,11,39,"{\cf2 Now was there one Tryphon, that had bene of Alexanders part afore, which when he saw that all the hoste murmured against Demetrius, he went to Simaleue the Arabian, that brought vp Antiochus the sonne of Alexander,}"
72,11,40,"{\cf2 And lay sore vpon him, to deliuer him this yong Antiochus, that he might reigne in his fathers steade: hee tolde him also what great euill Demetrius had done, and howe his men of warre hated him, and he remained there a long season.}"
72,11,41,"{\cf2 Also Ionathan sent vnto King Demetrius to driue them out which were in the castell at Ierusalem, and those that were in the fortresses: for they fought against Israel.}"
72,11,42,"{\cf2 So Demetrius sent vnto Ionathan, saying, I will not onely doe these things for thee, and thy nation, but if opportunitie serue, I will honour thee, and thy nation.}"
72,11,43,"{\cf2 Nowe therefore thou shalt doe me a pleasure, if thou wilt send me men to helpe me: for all mine armie is gone from me.}"
72,11,44,"{\cf2 So Ionathan sent him three thousand strong men vnto Antiochia, and they came vnto the King: wherefore the King was very glad at their comming.}"
72,11,45,"{\cf2 But they that were of the citie, euen an hundreth, and twentie thousand men, gathered them together in the mids of the citie, and would haue slaine the King.}"
72,11,46,"{\cf2 But the King fled into the palace, and the citizens kept the streetes of the citie, and began to fight.}"
72,11,47,"{\cf2 Then the king called to the Iewes for helpe, which came to him all together, and went abroad through the citie,}"
72,11,48,"{\cf2 And slewe the same day an hundreth thousand, and set fire vpon the citie, and tooke many spoyles in that day, and deliuered the King.}"
72,11,49,"{\cf2 So when the citizens saw that the Iewes had gotten the vpper hand of the citie, and that they themselues were disappointed of their purpose, they made their supplication vnto the King, saying,}"
72,11,50,"{\cf2 Graunt vs peace, and let the Iewes cease from vexing vs and the citie.}"
72,11,51,"{\cf2 So they cast away their weapons, and made peace, and the Iewes were greatly honoured before the King, and before all that were in his Realme, and they came againe to Ierusalem with great pray.}"
72,11,52,"{\cf2 Then King Demetrius sate in the throne of his kingdome, and had peace in his land.}"
72,11,53,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse hee dissembled in all that euer he spake, and withdrewe him selfe from Ionathan, neither did he rewarde him according to the benefites which he had done for him, but troubled him very sore.}"
72,11,54,"{\cf2 After this returned Tryphon with the yong childe Antiochus, which reigned, and was crowned.}"
72,11,55,"{\cf2 Then there gathered vnto him al the men of warre, whome Demetrius had scattered, and they fought against him, who fled and turned his backe.}"
72,11,56,"{\cf2 So Tryphon tooke the beastes, and wanne Antiochia.}"
72,11,57,"{\cf2 And yong Antiochus wrote vnto Ionathan, saying, I appoynt thee to bee the chiefe Priest, and make thee ruler ouer the foure gouernements, that thou mayest be a friend of the kings.}"
72,11,58,"{\cf2 Vpon this hee sent him golden vessels to be serued in, and gaue him leaue to drinke in gold, and to weare purple, and to haue a colar of gold.}"
72,11,59,"{\cf2 He made his brother Simon also captaine fro the coastes of Tyrus vnto the borders of Egypt.}"
72,11,60,"{\cf2 Then Ionathan went foorth, and passedthorow the cities beyond the flood, and all the men of warre of Syria gathered vnto him for to helpe him: so he came vnto Ascalon, and they of the citie receiued him honourably.}"
72,11,61,"{\cf2 And from thence went hee vnto Gaza: but they of Gaza shut him out: wherefore he layd siege vnto it, and burned the suburbes thereof with fire, and spoyled them.}"
72,11,62,"{\cf2 Then they of Gaza made supplication vnto Ionathan, and he made peace with them, and tooke of the sonnes of the chiefe men for hostages, and sent them to Ierusalem, and went thorow the countrey vnto Damascus.}"
72,11,63,"{\cf2 And when Ionathan heard that Demetrius princes were come into Cades, which is in Galile, with a great hoste, purposing to driue him out of the countrey,}"
72,11,64,"{\cf2 Hee came against them, and left Simon his brother in the countrey.}"
72,11,65,"{\cf2 And Simon besieged Beth-sura, and fought against it a long season, and shut it vp.}"
72,11,66,"{\cf2 So they desired to haue peace with him, which hee graunted them, and afterwarde put them out from thence, and tooke the citie, and set a garison in it.}"
72,11,67,"{\cf2 Then Ionathan with his hoste came to the water of Genesar, and betimes in the morning came to the plaine of Azor.}"
72,11,68,"{\cf2 And behold the hostes of the strangers met him in the plaine, and had layde ambushments for him in the mountaines.}"
72,11,69,"{\cf2 So that when they came against them, the ambushments rose out of their places & skirmished.}"
72,11,70,"{\cf2 So that all that were of Ionathans side, fled: and there was not one of them left, except Mattathias the sonne of Absalomus, and Iudas the sonne of Calphi the captaines of the hoste.}"
72,11,71,"{\cf2 Then Ionathan rent his clothes, and cast earth vpon his head, and prayed,}"
72,11,72,"{\cf2 And turned againe to them to fight, and put them to flight, so that they fled away.}"
72,11,73,"{\cf2 Now when his owne men that were fled, saw this, they turned againe vnto him, and helped him to followe after all vnto their tentes at Cades, and there they camped.}"
72,11,74,"{\cf2 So there were slaine of the strangers the same day about three thousande men, and Ionathan turned againe to Ierusalem.}"
72,12,1,"{\cf2 Ionathan nowe seeing that the time was meete for him, chose certeine men, and sent them vnto Rome, to establish & renue the friedship with them.}"
72,12,2,"{\cf2 Hee sent letters also vnto the Spartians and to other places, for the same purpose.}"
72,12,3,"{\cf2 So they went vnto Rome, and entred into the Senate, and saide, Ionathan the high Priest and the nation of the Iewes sent vs vnto you, for to renue friendship with you, and the bond of loue, as in times past.}"
72,12,4,"{\cf2 So the Romanes gaue them free pasports, that men should leade them home into the land of Iuda peaceably.}"
72,12,5,"{\cf2 And this is the copie of the letters that Ionathan wrote vnto the Spartians,}"
72,12,6,"{\cf2 Ionathan the hie Priest with the Elders of the nation, and the Priestes, and the rest of the people of the Iewes, sende greeting vnto the Spartians their brethren.}"
72,12,7,"{\cf2 Heretofore were letters sent vnto Onias the hie Priest, from Arius, which then reigned among you, that ye would be our brethren, as the copy hereunder written specifieth.}"
72,12,8,"{\cf2 And Onias intreated the ambassadour honourably, and receiued the letters: wherein there was mention made of the bond of loue and friendship.}"
72,12,9,"{\cf2 But as for vs, we neede no such writings: for we haue the holy bookes in our hands for comfort.}"
72,12,10,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse wee thought it good to sende vnto you, for the renuing of the brotherhoode and friendship, least we should be strange vnto you: for it is long since the time that ye sent vnto vs.}"
72,12,11,"{\cf2 Wherefore wee remember you at all seasons continually, and in the feasts & other dayes appointed, when we offer sacrifices & prayers, as it is meete and conuenient to thinke vpon our brethren.}"
72,12,12,"{\cf2 And we reioyce at your prosperous estate.}"
72,12,13,"{\cf2 And though wee haue bene enuironed with great troubles and warres, so that the Kings rounde about vs haue fought against vs,}"
72,12,14,"{\cf2 Yet would we not be grieuous vnto you, nor to other of our confederates and friendes in these warres.}"
72,12,15,"{\cf2 For we haue had helpe from heauen, that hath succoured vs, and wee are deliuered from our enemies, and our enemies are subdued.}"
72,12,16,"{\cf2 Yet haue wee chosen Numenius the sonne of Antiochus, and Antipater the sonne of Iason, and sent them vnto the Romaines, for to renue the former friendship with them, and league.}"
72,12,17,"{\cf2 We commanded them also to goe vnto you, and to salute you, and to deliuer you our letters, concerning the renuing of our brotherhoode.}"
72,12,18,"{\cf2 And now ye shall doe vs a pleasure to giue vs an answere of these things.}"
72,12,19,"{\cf2 And this was the copie of the letters, which Arius the King of Sparta sent vnto Onias.}"
72,12,20,"{\cf2 The King of the Spartians vnto Onias the high Priest sendeth greeting.}"
72,12,21,"{\cf2 It is founde in writing, that the Spartians and Iewes are brethren, and come out of the generation of Abraham.}"
72,12,22,"{\cf2 And nowe for so much as this is come to our knowledge, yee shall doe well, to write vnto vs of your prosperitie.}"
72,12,23,"{\cf2 As for vs, wee haue written vnto you, that your cattell and goods are ours, and ours are yours: these thinges haue wee commaunded to be shewed vnto you.}"
72,12,24,"{\cf2 Nowe when Ionathan heard, that Demetrius princes were come to fight against him, with a greater hoste then afore,}"
72,12,25,"{\cf2 Hee went from Ierusalem, and met them in the land of Hamath: for he gaue them not space to come into his owne countrey.}"
72,12,26,"{\cf2 And hee sent spies vnto their tentes, which came againe, and tolde him, that they were appointed to come vpon him in the night.}"
72,12,27,"{\cf2 Wherefore, when the sunne was gone downe, Ionathan commaunded his men to watch, and to be in armes readie to fight all the night, & sent watchmen round about the hoste.}"
72,12,28,"{\cf2 But when the aduersaries heard that Ionathan was readie with his men to the battel, they feared, & trembled in their hearts, and kindled fires in their tents, and fled away.}"
72,12,29,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse Ionathan and his companie knewe it not till the morning: for they saw the fires burning.}"
72,12,30,"{\cf2 Then Ionathan followed vpon them, but he coulde not ouertake them: for they were gone ouer the flood Eleutherus.}"
72,12,31,"{\cf2 So Ionathan turned to the Arabians, which were called Zabedei, and slewe them, and tooke their spoile.}"
72,12,32,"{\cf2 He proceeded further also, and came vnto Damascus, and went thorow all the countrey.}"
72,12,33,"{\cf2 But Simon his brother went forth, and came to Ascalon and to the next holdes, departing vnto Ioppe, and wanne it.}"
72,12,34,"{\cf2 For he heard that they would deliuer the hold to them that tooke Demetrius part: wherefore hee set a garison there to keepe it.}"
72,12,35,"{\cf2 After this came Ionathan home, and called the Elders of the people together, and deuised with them for to build vp ye strong holds in Iudea,}"
72,12,36,"{\cf2 And to make the walles of Ierusalem hyer, and to make a great mount betwixt the castell and the citie, for to separate it from the citie, that it might be alone, and that men shoulde neither bye, nor fell in it.}"
72,12,37,"{\cf2 So they came together to builde vp the citie: for part of the wall vpon the brooke of the Eastside was fallen downe, and they repaired it, and called it Caphenatha.}"
72,12,38,"{\cf2 Simon also set vp Adida in Sephela, and made it strong with gates and barres.}"
72,12,39,"{\cf2 In the meane time Tryphon purposed to reigne in Asia, & to be crowned when he had slaine the King Antiochus.}"
72,12,40,"{\cf2 But he was afraide that Ionathan would not suffer him, but fight against him: wherefore he went about to take Ionathan, and to kill him: so hee departed, and came vnto Bethsan.}"
72,12,41,"{\cf2 Then went Ionathan foorth against him to the battell with fourtie thousande chosen men, and came vnto Bethsan.}"
72,12,42,"{\cf2 But when Tryphon saw that Ionathan came with so great an hoste, hee durst not laye hande vpon him,}"
72,12,43,"{\cf2 But receiued him honourably, and commended him vnto all his friendes, and gaue him rewards, and commaunded his men of warre to be as obedient vnto him as to himselfe,}"
72,12,44,"{\cf2 And said vnto Ionathan, Why hast thou caused this people to take such trauaile, seeing there is no warre betweene vs?}"
72,12,45,"{\cf2 Therefore send them now home againe, and chuse certaine men to waite vpon thee, and come thou with mee to Ptolemais: for I will giue it thee, with the other strong holdes, and the other garisons, and all them that haue the charge of the common affaires: so will I returne, and depart: for this is the cause of my comming.}"
72,12,46,"{\cf2 Ionathan beleeued him, and did as hee saide, and sent away his hoste, which went into the lande of Iuda,}"
72,12,47,"{\cf2 And reteined but three thousande with him, whereof he sent two thousand into Galile, and one thousand went with himselfe.}"
72,12,48,"{\cf2 Nowe assoone as Ionathan entred into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates, and tooke him, and slew all them with the sword, that came in with him.}"
72,12,49,"{\cf2 Then sent Tryphon an hoste of footemen, and horsemen into Galile, and into the great plaine, to destroy all Ionathans companie.}"
72,12,50,"{\cf2 But when they knewe that Ionathan was taken, and slaine, and those that were with him, they incouraged one another, and came foorth against them readie to the battell.}"
72,12,51,"{\cf2 But when they which followed vpon them, sawe that it was a matter of life, they turned backe againe.}"
72,12,52,"{\cf2 By this meanes all they came into the land of Iuda peaceably, and bewailed Ionathan, and them that were with him, and feared greatly, and all Israel made great lamentation.}"
72,12,53,"{\cf2 For all the heathen that were rounde about them, sought to destroy them.}"
72,12,54,"{\cf2 For they said, Now haue they no captaine, nor any man to helpe them: therefore let vs now fight against them, and roote out their memorie from among men.}"
72,13,1,"{\cf2 Nowe when Simon heard that Tryphon gathered a great hoste to come into the land of Iuda, to destroy it,}"
72,13,2,"{\cf2 And sawe that the people was in great trembling and feare, he came vp to Ierusalem, and gathered the people together,}"
72,13,3,"{\cf2 And gaue them exhortation, saying, Ye know what great thinges I, and my brethren, and my fathers house haue done for the Lawe, & the Sanctuarie, and the battels, & troubles that we haue seene.}"
72,13,4,"{\cf2 By reason whereof all my brethren are slaine for Israels sake, and I am left alone.}"
72,13,5,"{\cf2 Nowe therefore God forbid, that I shoulde spare mine owne life in any time of trouble: for I am not better then my brethren.}"
72,13,6,"{\cf2 But I wil auenge my nation, and the Sanctuarie, and our wiues, and our children: for all the heathen are gathered together to destroye vs of very malice.}"
72,13,7,"{\cf2 In hearing these words the hearts of the people were kindled,}"
72,13,8,"{\cf2 So that they cried with a lowd voyce, saying, Thou shalt be our captaine in steade of Iudas and Ionathan thy brethren.}"
72,13,9,"{\cf2 Fight thou our battels, and whatsoeuer thou commaundest vs, we will doe it.}"
72,13,10,"{\cf2 So hee gathered all the men of warre, making hast to finish the walles of Ierusalem, and fortified it round about.}"
72,13,11,"{\cf2 Then sent he Ionathan the sonne of Absalomus with a great host vnto Ioppe, which droue them out that were therein, and remained there himselfe.}"
72,13,12,"{\cf2 Tryphon also remoued from Ptolemais with a great armie, to come into the land of Iuda, and Ionathan was with him as prisoner.}"
72,13,13,"{\cf2 And Simon pitched his tents at Addidis vpon the open plaine.}"
72,13,14,"{\cf2 But when Tryphon knew that Simon stoode vp in steade of his brother Ionathan, and that hee woulde fight against him, hee sent messengers vnto him, saying,}"
72,13,15,"{\cf2 Whereas we haue kept Ionathan thy brother, it is for money that hee is owing in the Kings account concerning the busines that he had in hand.}"
72,13,16,"{\cf2 Wherefore send now an hundreth talents of siluer, and his two sonnes for hostages, that when he is letten foorth, hee will not turne from vs, andwe will send him againe.}"
72,13,17,"{\cf2 Neuertheles Simon knew that he dissembled in his wordes, yet commaunded he the money and children to be deliuered vnto him, least he should be in greater hatred of the people of Israel.}"
72,13,18,"{\cf2 Who might haue sayd, Because he sent him not the money and the children, therefore is Ionathan dead.}"
72,13,19,"{\cf2 So he sent the children and an hundreth talents: but he dissembled, and would not let Ionathan goe.}"
72,13,20,"{\cf2 Afterward came Tryphon into the land to destroy it, and went round about by the way, that leadeth vnto Adora: but wheresoeuer they went, thither went Simon and his hoste.}"
72,13,21,"{\cf2 Now they that were in the castell, sent messengers vnto Tryphon, that hee should make haste to come by the wildernes, & to send them vittailes.}"
72,13,22,"{\cf2 So Tryphon made ready all his horsemen: but the same night fell a very great snowe, so that he came not, because of the snowe: but he remoued and went into the countrey of Galaad.}"
72,13,23,"{\cf2 And when hee came neere to Bascama, he slewe Ionathan, and he was buried there.}"
72,13,24,"{\cf2 So Tryphon returned, and went into his owne land.}"
72,13,25,"{\cf2 Then sent Simon to take the bones of Ionathan his brother, and they buried him in Modin his fathers citie.}"
72,13,26,"{\cf2 And all Israel bewailed him with great lamentation, and mourned for him very long.}"
72,13,27,"{\cf2 And Simon made vpon the sepulchre of his father and his brethren, a building hie to looke vnto, of hewen stone behinde and before,}"
72,13,28,"{\cf2 And set vp seuen pillars vpon it, one against another, for his father, his mother, and foure brethren,}"
72,13,29,"{\cf2 And set great pillars round about them, and set armes vpon the pillars for a perpetuall memorie, and carued ships beside the armes, that they might be seene of men sayling in the sea.}"
72,13,30,"{\cf2 This sepulchre which hee made at Modin, standeth yet vnto this day.}"
72,13,31,"{\cf2 Nowe as Tryphon went foorth with the yong King Antiochus, he slew him traiterously,}"
72,13,32,"{\cf2 And reigned in his steade, and crowned him selfe King of Asia, and brought a great plague vpon the land.}"
72,13,33,"{\cf2 Simon also built vp the castels of Iudea, and compassed them about with hie towers, and great walles, euen with towers, and gates, and barres, and layde vp vittailes in the strong holdes.}"

72,13,36,"{\cf2 Demetrivs the King vnto Simon the hie Priest, and the friend of Kings, & to the Elders and to the nation of the Iewes sendeth greeting.}"
72,13,37,"{\cf2 The golden crowne, and precious stone that ye sent vnto vs, haue we receiued, and are ready to make a stedfast peace with you, and to write vnto the officers, to release you of the things wherein we made you free.}"
72,13,38,"{\cf2 So the things that we haue graunted you, shall be stable: the strong holdes which ye haue builded, shalbe your owne.}"
72,13,39,"{\cf2 Also we forgiue the ouersights, and faultes committed vnto this day, and the crowne taxe that ye ought vs: and whereas was any other tribute in Ierusalem, it shalbe nowe no tribute.}"
72,13,40,"{\cf2 And they that are meete among you to be written with our men, let them be written vp, that there may be peace betweene vs.}"
72,13,41,"{\cf2 Thus the yoke of the heathen was taken from Israel in the hundred and seuentie yeere.}"
72,13,42,"{\cf2 And the people of Israel began to write in their letters, and publique instruments, In The First yeere of Simon, the hie and chiefe Priest, gouernour and prince of the Iewes.}"
72,13,43,"{\cf2 In those dayes Simon camped against Gaza, and besieged it round about, where he set vp an engine of warre, and approched neere the citie, and beat a tower, and tooke it.}"
72,13,44,"{\cf2 So they that were in the engine, leapt into the citie, and there was great trouble in the citie,}"
72,13,45,"{\cf2 In so much that the people of the citie rent their clothes, and climed vp vpon the walles with their wiues, & children, & cried with a loud voyce, beseeching Simon to graunt them peace, saying,}"
72,13,46,"{\cf2 Deale not with vs according to our wickednes, but according to thy mercy.}"
72,13,47,"{\cf2 Then Simon pitied them, and would fight no more against them, but put them out of the citie, and clensed the houses, wherein the idoles were, and so entred thereunto with psalmes and thankesgiuing.}"
72,13,48,"{\cf2 So when he had cast all the filthines out, he set such men in it as kept the Law, and fortified it, and builded there a dwelling place for him selfe.}"
72,13,49,"{\cf2 Nowe, when they in the castell at Ierusalem were kept, that they could not come foorth nor goe into the countrey, neither buy nor sell, they were very hungry, & many of them were famished to death,}"
72,13,50,"{\cf2 In so much that they besought Simon to make peace with them: which he graunted them, and put them out from thence, and clensed the castell from filthines.}"
72,13,51,"{\cf2 And vpon the three and twentie day of the second moneth, in the hundreth seuentie and one yeere, they entred into it with thankesgiuing, and branches of palme trees, and with harpes, and with cymbales, and with violes, & with psalmes, & songs, because the great enemie of Israel was ouercome.}"
72,13,52,"{\cf2 And he ordeined that the same day should be kept euery yeere with gladnes.}"
72,13,53,"{\cf2 And he fortified the mount of the Temple that was beside the castell where he dwelt himselfe with his company.}"
72,13,54,"{\cf2 Simon also seeing that Iohn his sonne was now a man, he made him captaine of all the hostes, and caused him to dwell in Gazaris.}"
72,14,1,"{\cf2 In the hundred seuentie and two yeere gathered King Demetrius his hoste, and departed vnto Media, to get him helpe for to fight against Tryphon.}"
72,14,2,"{\cf2 But when Arsaces the King of Persia and Media heard, that Demetrius was entred within his borders, hee sent one of his princes to take him aliue.}"
72,14,3,"{\cf2 So he went, and ouercame the armie of Demetrius, and tooke him, and brought him to Arsaces, which kept him in warde.}"
72,14,4,"{\cf2 Thus all the land of Iuda was in rest, so long as Simon liued: for he sought the wealth of his nation: therefore were they glad to haue him for their ruler, and to doe him worship alway.}"
72,14,5,"{\cf2 Simon also wanne the citie of Ioppe to his great honour to be an hauen towne, and made it an entrance vnto the yles of the sea.}"
72,14,6,"{\cf2 He enlarged also the borders of his people, their and conquered the countreys.}"
72,14,7,"{\cf2 He gathered vp many of their people that were prisoners, & he had the dominion of Gazaris, and Beth-sura, & the castell, which he clensed from filthines, and there was no man that resisted him,}"
72,14,8,"{\cf2 So that euery ma tilled his ground in peace, and the land gaue her fruites, and the trees gaue their fruite.}"
72,14,9,"{\cf2 The Elders sate in the open places, and consulted all together for the common wealth, and the yong men were honourably clothed and armed.}"
72,14,10,"{\cf2 He prouided vittailes for the cities, and all kinde of munition, so that his glorious fame was renoumed vnto the end of the world.}"
72,14,11,"{\cf2 He made peace throughout the land, and Israel had perfite mirth and ioy.}"
72,14,12,"{\cf2 For euery man sate vnder his vine, and the fig trees, and there was no man to fray them.}"
72,14,13,"{\cf2 There was none in the land to fight against them: for then the Kings were ouercome.}"
72,14,14,"{\cf2 He helped all those that were in aduersitie among his people: hee was diligent to see the Law kept, and he tooke away the vngodly, and wicked.}"
72,14,15,"{\cf2 He beautified the Sanctuarie, and encreased the vessels of the Temple.}"
72,14,16,"{\cf2 When the Romanes heard, and the Spartians had knowledge, that Ionathan was dead, they were very sorie.}"

72,14,24,"{\cf2 After this Simon sent Numenius to Rome, with a great shield of golde of a thousand pound weight, to confirme the friendship with them.}"
72,14,25,"{\cf2 Which when the people vnderstood, they sayd, What thankes shal we recompense againe vnto Simon and his children?}"
72,14,26,"{\cf2 For he and his brethren, and the house of his father haue stablished Israel, and ouercome their enemies, and haue confirmed the libertie thereof: therefore they wrote this in tables of brasse, and set it vpon pillars in mount Sion.}"
72,14,27,"{\cf2 The copy of the writing is this, In the eight and twentie day of the moneth Elul in the hundreth, seuentie and two yeere, in the third yeere of Simon the hie Priest.}"
72,14,28,"{\cf2 In Saramel in the great congregation of the Priests, and of the people, and of the gouernours of the nation, and of the Elders of the countrey, we would signifie vnto you, that many battels haue bene fought in our countrey.}"
72,14,29,"{\cf2 Wherein Simon ye sonne of Mattathias (come of the children of Iarib) and his brethren put them selues in danger, and resisted the enemies of their nation, that their Sanctuarie, and Lawe might be mainteined, and did their nation great honour.}"
72,14,30,"{\cf2 For Ionathan gathered his nation together, and became their hie Priest, and is layde with his people.}"
72,14,31,"{\cf2 After that would their enemies haue inuaded their countrey, and destroyed their land, and lay their hands on their Sanctuarie.}"

72,14,33,"{\cf2 He fortified also the cities of Iudea, & Bethsura that lyeth vpon the borders of Iudea (where the ordinance of their enemies lay sometime) and set there a garison of the Iewes.}"
72,14,34,"{\cf2 And he fortified Ioppe, which lyeth vpon the sea, & Gazara that bordereth vpon Azotus, (where the enemies dwelt afore) and there he placed Iewes, and furnished them with things necessarie for the reparation thereof.}"
72,14,35,"{\cf2 Now when the people saw the faithfulnes of Simon, and to what glory hee thought to bring his nation vnto, they made him their gouernour, and the chiefe Priest, because hee had done all these things, and for the vprightnes, and fidelitie that he had kept to his nation, & that sought by all meanes to exalt his people.}"
72,14,36,"{\cf2 For in his time they prospered well by him, so that the heathen were taken out of their countrey, and they also which were in the citie of Dauid at Ierusalem, where they had made them a castell, out of the which they went, and defiled all things that were about the Sanctuarie, & did great hurt vnto religion.}"
72,14,37,"{\cf2 And he set Iewes in it, and fortified it, for the assurance of the land, and citie, and raised vp the walles of Ierusalem.}"
72,14,38,"{\cf2 And King Demetrius confirmed him in his hie Priesthood for these causes,}"
72,14,39,"{\cf2 And made him one of his friends, and gaue him great honour.}"
72,14,40,"{\cf2 For it was reported that the Romanes called the Iewes their friends, and confederates, and that they honourably receiued Simons Ambassadours,}"

73,1,19,"{\cf2 For when as our fathers were led away vnto Persia, the Priests, which sought the honor of God, tooke the fire of the altar priuilie, and hid it in an hollowe pit, which was drie in the bottome, and therein they kept it, so that ye place was vnknowen vnto euery man.}"
73,1,20,"{\cf2 Nowe after many yeres when it pleased God that Neemias shoulde be sent from the king of Persia, he sent of the posteritie of those Priestes, which had hid it to fetche the fire, and as they tolde vs, they found no fire, but thicke water.}"
73,1,21,"{\cf2 Then commaunded he them to drawe it vp, and to bring it: and when the things apperteining to the sacrifices were brought, Neemias commaunded the Priests to sprinkle the woode, and the things laide thereupon with water.}"
73,1,22,"{\cf2 When this was done, and the time came that the sunne shone, which afore was hid in the cloud, there was a great fire kindled, so that euery man marueiled.}"

73,1,24,"{\cf2 And the praier of Neemias was after this maner, O Lord, Lord God maker of all things, which art feareful, and strong, and righteous, and merciful, and the onely and gratious king,}"

73,1,29,"{\cf2 Plant thy people againe in thine holy place as Moyses hath spoken.}"
73,1,30,"{\cf2 And the Priests sang Psalmes thereunto.}"
73,1,31,"{\cf2 Now when the sacrifice was consumed, Neemias commanded the great stones to be sprinkled with the residue of the water.}"
73,1,32,"{\cf2 Which when it was done, there was kindeled a flame, which was consumed by the light, that shined from the altar.}"
73,1,33,"{\cf2 So when this matter was knowen, it was told the King of Persia, that in the place where the Priests, which were led away, had hid fire, there appeared water, wherewith Neemias and his companie had purified the sacrifices.}"
73,1,34,"{\cf2 The King tried out the thing, and closed the place about, and made it holy.}"
73,1,35,"{\cf2 And to them that the King fauoured, he gaue and bestowed many gifts.}"
73,1,36,"{\cf2 And Neemias called the same place Ephthar, which is to say, purification: but many men call it Nephthar.}"
73,2,1,"{\cf2 It is founde also in the writings of Ieremias the Prophet, that he commaunded them, which were caried away, to take fire, as was declared, and as the Prophet commanded them that were led into captiuitie,}"
73,2,2,"{\cf2 Giuing them a lawe that they shoulde not forget the commaundements of the Lord, and that they should not erre in their minds, when they saw images of gold and siluer, with their ornaments.}"
73,2,3,"{\cf2 These and such other things commanded he them, and exhorted them that they shoulde not let the Lawe goe out of their hearts.}"
73,2,4,"{\cf2 It is written also, howe the Prophet, by an oracle that he had, charged them to take the tabernacle and the arke, and followe him: and when hee came vp into the mountaine where Moyses went vp, and sawe the heritage of God,}"
73,2,5,"{\cf2 Ieremias went foorth, and founde an hollow caue, wherein he laide the Tabernacle, & the Arke, and the altar of incense, and so stopped the doore.}"
73,2,6,"{\cf2 And there came certaine of those that followed him, to marke ye place: but they coulde not finde it.}"
73,2,7,"{\cf2 Which whe Ieremias perceiued, he reproued them, saying, As for that place: it shalbe vnknowen, vntil the time that God gather his people together againe, and that mercie be shewed.}"
73,2,8,"{\cf2 Then shall the Lord shew them these things, and the maiestie of the Lorde shall appeare and the cloude also, as it was shewed vnder Moyses, and as when Salomon desired, that the place might be honourably sanctified.}"
73,2,9,"{\cf2 For it is manifest that he, being a wise man, offred the sacrifice of dedication, and consecration of the Temple.}"
73,2,10,"{\cf2 And as when Moyses praied vnto the Lord, the fire came downe from heauen, and consumed the sacrifice: so, when Salomon prayed, the fire came downe from heauen, and consumed the burnt offering.}"
73,2,11,"{\cf2 And Moyses saide, Because the sinne offering was not eaten, therefore is it consumed.}"
73,2,12,"{\cf2 So Salomon kept those eight daies.}"
73,2,13,"{\cf2 These things also are declared in the writings, and registers of Neemias, and howe he made a librarie, and howe he gathered the acts of the Kings, and of the Prophets, and the acts of Dauid, and the epistles of the Kings concerning the holy gifts.}"

73,2,26,"{\cf2 Therefore to vs that haue taken in hand this great labour, it was no easie thing to make this abbridgement, but required both sweat, & watching.}"
73,2,27,"{\cf2 Like as hee that maketh a feast, and seeketh other mens commoditie, hath no smal labour: so we also for many mens sakes are very well content to vndertake this great labour.}"

73,3,1,"{\cf2 What time as the holy citie was inhabited with all peace, and when the Lawes were very well kept, because of the godlinesse of Onias the hie Priest, and hatred of wickednesse,}"
73,3,2,"{\cf2 It came to passe that euen the kings did honour the place, and garnished the Temple with great gifts.}"
73,3,3,"{\cf2 In so much that Seleucus king of Asia of his owne rents, bare all the costes belonging to the seruice of the sacrifices.}"
73,3,4,"{\cf2 But one Simon of the tribe of Beniamin being appoynted ruler of the Temple, contended with the hie Priest concerning the iniquitie committed in the citie.}"
73,3,5,"{\cf2 And when hee coulde not ouercome Onias, he gate him to Apollonius the sonne of Thraseas, which then was gouernour of Coelosyria and Phenice,}"
73,3,6,"{\cf2 And tolde him that the treasurie in Ierusalem was full of innumerable money, which did not belong to the prouision of the sacrifices, and thatit were possible that these things might come into the Kings hands.}"
73,3,7,"{\cf2 Nowe when Apollonius came to the King, and had shewed him of the money, as it was tolde him, the King chose out Heliodorus his treasurer, and sent him with a commandement, to bring him the foresaid money.}"
73,3,8,"{\cf2 Immediatly Heliodorus tooke his iourney as though he would visite the cities of Coelosyria and Phenice, but in effect to fulfill the Kings purpose.}"
73,3,9,"{\cf2 So when he came to Ierusalem, & was courteously receiued of the hie Priest into the citie, he declared what was determined concerning the money, and shewed the cause of his comming, and asked if these things were so in deede.}"
73,3,10,"{\cf2 Then the hie Priest tolde him that there were such things laid vp by the widowes and fatherlesse,}"
73,3,11,"{\cf2 And that a certaine of it belonged vnto Hircanus the sonne of Tobias a noble man, and not as that wicked Simon had reported, and that in all, there were but foure hundreth talents of siluer, and two hundreth of gold,}"
73,3,12,"{\cf2 And that it were altogether vnpossible to do this wrong to them that had committed it of trust to the holinesse of the place and Temple, which is honoured thorowe the whole worlde for holinesse and integritie.}"
73,3,13,"{\cf2 But Heliodorus because of the Kings commandement giuen him, said that in any wise it must be brought into the Kings treasurie.}"
73,3,14,"{\cf2 So he appointed a day, and went in to take order for these things: then there was no small griefe throughout the whole citie.}"
73,3,15,"{\cf2 For the Priest fell downe before the altar in the Priestes garments, and called vnto heauen vpon him which had made a Lawe concerning things giuen to be kept, that they shoulde be safely preserued for such as had committed them to be kept.}"
73,3,16,"{\cf2 Then they that looked the hie Priest in the face, were wounded in their heart: for his countenance, and the changing of his colour declared the sorowe of his mind.}"
73,3,17,"{\cf2 The man was so wrapped in feare and trembling of the body, that it was manifest to them that looked vpon him, what sorowe he had in his heart.}"
73,3,18,"{\cf2 Others also came out of their houses by heapes vnto the common prayer, because the place was like to come vnto contempt.}"
73,3,19,"{\cf2 And the women, girt with sackcloth vnder their breastes, filled the streetes, and the virgins that were kept in, ranne some to the gates & some to the walles, and others looked out of the windowes.}"
73,3,20,"{\cf2 And all held vp their hands towarde heauen, and made prayer.}"
73,3,21,"{\cf2 It was a lamentable thing to see ye multitude that fell downe of all sortes, and the expectation of the high Priest being in such anguish.}"
73,3,22,"{\cf2 Therefore they called vpon the Almightie Lord, that he would keepe safe and sure the thinges, which were laide vp for those that had deliuered them.}"
73,3,23,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse, the thing that Heliodorus was determined to doe, that did he performe.}"
73,3,24,"{\cf2 And as he and his souldiers were nowe there present by the treasurie, he that is the Lorde of the spirits, and of al power, shewed a great vision, so that all they which presumed to come with him, were astonished at the power of God, and fell into feare, and trembling.}"
73,3,25,"{\cf2 For there appeared vnto them an horse with a terrible man sitting vpon him, most richly barbed, and he ranne fiercely, and smote at Heliodorus with his fore feete, and it seemed that he that sate vpon the horse, had harnesse of gold.}"
73,3,26,"{\cf2 Moreouer, there appeared two yong men, notable in strength, excellent in beautie, and comely in apparell, which stood by him on either side, & scourged him continually, & gaue him many sore stripes.}"
73,3,27,"{\cf2 And Heliodorus fell suddenly vnto ye ground, and was couered with great darkenes: but they that were with him, tooke him vp, & put him in a litter.}"
73,3,28,"{\cf2 Thus he that came with so great companie, and many souldiers into the said treasurie, was borne out: for he coulde not helpe himselfe with his weapons.}"
73,3,29,"{\cf2 So they did knowe the power of God manifestly, but he was domme by the power of God, and lay destitute of all hope and health.}"
73,3,30,"{\cf2 And they praysed the Lord that had honoured his owne place: for the Temple which a litle afore was full of feare and trouble, when the almightie Lord appeared, was filled with ioy and gladnesse.}"
73,3,31,"{\cf2 Then streightwayes certaine of Heliodorus friends prayed Onias, that he woulde call vpon the most High to graunt him his life, which lay ready to giue vp the ghost.}"
73,3,32,"{\cf2 So the hie Priest, considering that the King might suspect that the Iewes had done Heliodorus some euill, he offered a sacrifice for the health of the man.}"
73,3,33,"{\cf2 Now when the hie Priest had made his prayer, the same yong men in the same clothing appeared, and stoode beside Heliodorus, saying, Giue Onias the hie Priest great thankes: for, for his sake hath the Lord graunted thee thy life.}"
73,3,34,"{\cf2 And seeing that thou hast bene scourged from heauen, declare vnto all men the mightie power of God: and when they had spoken these wordes, they appeared no more.}"
73,3,35,"{\cf2 So Heliodorus offered vnto the Lorde sacrifice, and made great vowes vnto him, which had graunted him his life, and thanked Onias, and went againe with his hoste to the King.}"
73,3,36,"{\cf2 Then testified he vnto euery man of ye great workes of God that he had seene with his eyes.}"
73,3,37,"{\cf2 And when the King asked Heliodorus, who were meete to be sent yet once againe to Ierusalem, he said,}"
73,3,38,"{\cf2 If thou hast any enemie or traitor, sende him thither, and thou shalt receiue him well scourged, if he escape with his life: for in that place, no doubt, there is a speciall power of God.}"
73,3,39,"{\cf2 For he that dwelleth in heauen, hath his eye on that place, and defendeth it, and he beateth and destroyeth them that come to hurt it.}"
73,3,40,"{\cf2 This came to passe concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of the treasurie.}"
73,4,1,"{\cf2 This Simon nowe, of whom we spake afore, being a bewrayer of the money and of his owne naturall countrey, reported euill of Onias, as though he had mooued Heliodorus vnto this, and had bene the inuenter of the euill.}"
73,4,2,"{\cf2 Thus was he bolde to call him a traitour that was so beneficiall to the citie, and a defender of his nation, and so zealous of the Lawes.}"
73,4,3,"{\cf2 But when his malice increased so farre, that through one that belonged to Simon, murthers were committed,}"
73,4,4,"{\cf2 Onias considering the danger of this contention, and that Apollonius, as hee that was the gouernour of Coelosyria and Phenice, did rage, and increased Simons malice,}"
73,4,5,"{\cf2 He went to the King not as an accuser of the citizens, but as one that intended the common wealth both priuately and publikely.}"
73,4,6,"{\cf2 For he sawe it was not possible except the King tooke order to quiet the matters, and that Simon would not leaue off his follie.}"
73,4,7,"{\cf2 But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, called Epiphanes, tooke the kingdome, Iason the brother of Onias laboured by vnlawfull meanes to be hie Priest.}"
73,4,8,"{\cf2 For he came vnto the King, and promised him three hundreth and threescore talents of siluer, and of an other rent, fourescore talents.}"
73,4,9,"{\cf2 Besides this, he promised him an hundreth and fiftie, if he might haue licence to set vp a place for exercise, and a place for the youth, and that they would name them of Ierusalem Antiochians.}"
73,4,10,"{\cf2 The which thing when the King had graunted, and he had gotten the superioritie, he beganne immediatly to drawe his kinsemen to the customes of the Gentiles,}"
73,4,11,"{\cf2 And abolished the friendly priuiledges of the Kings, that the Iewes had set vp by Iohn, the father of Eupolemus, which was sent ambassadour vnto Rome, to become friends and confederates: he put downe their Lawes and policies, and brought vp newe statutes, and contrary to the Lawe.}"
73,4,12,"{\cf2 For he presumed to builde a place of exercise vnder the castell, and brought the chiefe yong men vnder his subiection, and made them weare hattes.}"
73,4,13,"{\cf2 So there beganne a great desire to followe the maners of the Gentiles, and they tooke vp the fashions of strange nations by the exceeding wickednesse of Iason, not the hie Priest, but the vngodly person,}"
73,4,14,"{\cf2 So that the Priestes were nowe no more diligent about the seruice of the altar, but despised the Temple, and regarded not the sacrifices, but made haste to be partakers of the wicked expences at the play after the casting of the stone.}"
73,4,15,"{\cf2 For they did not set by the honour of their fathers, but liked the glory of the Gentiles best of all.}"
73,4,16,"{\cf2 By reason whereof great calamitie came vpon them: for they had them to be their enemies and punishers, whose custome they followed so earnestly, and desired to be like them in all things.}"
73,4,17,"{\cf2 For it is not a light thing to transgresse against the Lawes of God, but the time following shall declare these things.}"
73,4,18,"{\cf2 Now when the games that were vsed euery fiue yeere, were played at Tyrus, the King being present,}"
73,4,19,"{\cf2 This wicked Iason sent from Ierusalem men to looke vpon them, as though they had bene Antiochians, which brought three hundreth drachmes of siluer for a sacrifice to Hercules: albeit they that caried them, desired they might not be bestowed on the sacrifice (because it was not comely) but to be bestowed for other expenses.}"
73,4,20,"{\cf2 So he that sent them, sent them for the sacrifice of Hercules: but because of those that brought them, they were giuen to the making of galleies.}"
73,4,21,"{\cf2 Now Apollonius the sonne of Menestheus was sent into Egypt because of the coronation of King Ptolemeus Philometor: but when Antiochus perceiued that he was euill affectioned towarde his affaires, he sought his owne assurance, and departed from thence to Ioppe, and so came to Ierusalem,}"
73,4,22,"{\cf2 Where he was honourably receiued of Iason, and of the citie, and was brought in with torchlight, and with great showtings, and so he went with his hoste vnto Phenice.}"
73,4,23,"{\cf2 Three yeere afterward Iason sent Menelaus, the foresaid Simons brother, to beare the money vnto the King, and to bring to passe certaine necessarie affaires, whereof he had giuen him a memoriall.}"
73,4,24,"{\cf2 But he, being commended to the King, magnified him for the appearance of his power, and turned the Priesthood vnto himselfe: for he gaue three hundreth talents of siluer more then Iason.}"
73,4,25,"{\cf2 So he gate the Kings letters patentes, albeit he had nothing in himselfe worthie of the hie Priesthood, but bare the stomacke of a cruell tyrant, and the wrath of a wilde beast.}"
73,4,26,"{\cf2 Then Iason, which had deceiued his owne brother, being deceiued by another, was compelled to flee into the countrey of the Ammonites.}"
73,4,27,"{\cf2 So Menelaus gate the dominion: but as for the money that he had promised vnto the King, he tooke none order for it, albeit Sostratus the ruler of the castell required it.}"
73,4,28,"{\cf2 For vnto him apperteyned the gathering of the customes: wherefore they were both called before the King.}"
73,4,29,"{\cf2 Nowe Menelaus left his brother Lysimachus in his steade in the priesthood, and Sostratus left Crates which was gouernour of the Cyprians.}"
73,4,30,"{\cf2 Whiles these things were in doing, ye Tharsians and they of Mallot made insurrection, because they were giuen to the Kings concubine called Antiochis.}"
73,4,31,"{\cf2 Then came the King in all haste, to appease the busines, leauing Andronicus a man of authoritie to be his lieutenant.}"
73,4,32,"{\cf2 Now Menelaus, supposing that he had gotten a conuenient time, stole certaine vessels of gold out of the Temple, and gaue certeyne of them to Andronicus: and some he solde at Tyrus and in the cities thereby.}"
73,4,33,"{\cf2 Which when Onias knewe of a suretie, he reproued him, and withdrewe himselfe into a Sanctuarie at Daphne by Antiochia.}"
73,4,34,"{\cf2 Wherefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus apart, prayed him to slaye Onias: so when he came te Onias, he counseled him craftily, giuing him his right hand with an othe: (howbeit he suspect him, and persuaded him to come out of the Sanctuarie) so he slewe him incontinently without any regarde of righteousnesse.}"
73,4,35,"{\cf2 For the which cause not onely the Iewes, but many other nations also were grieued, and tooke it heauily for the vnrighteous death of this man.}"
73,4,36,"{\cf2 And when the king was come againe from the places about Cilicia, the Iewes that were in the citie, and certeine of the Greeks that abhorred the fact also, complained because Onias was slaine without cause.}"
73,4,37,"{\cf2 Therefore Antiochus was sorie in his minde, and he had compassion, and wept because of the modestie and great discretion of him that was dead.}"
73,4,38,"{\cf2 Wherefore being kindled with anger, he tooke away Andronicus garment of purple, and rent his clothes, and commaunded him to be led throughout the citie, and in the same place where hee hadcommitted the wickednesse against Onias, hee was slaine as a murtherer. Thus the Lord rewarded him his punishment, as he had deserued.}"
73,4,39,"{\cf2 Nowe when Lysimachus had done many wicked deedes in the citie through the counsell of Menelaus, and the bruit was spred abroad, the multitude gathered them together against Lysimachus: for he had caried out nowe much vessell of golde.}"
73,4,40,"{\cf2 And when the people arose, and were full of anger, Lysimachus armed about three thousande, and began to vse vnlawfull power, a certaine tyrant being their captaine, who was no lesse decaied in wit then in age.}"
73,4,41,"{\cf2 But when they vnderstoode the purpose of Lysimachus, some gate stones, some great clubs, and some cast handfuls of dust, which lay by, vpon Lysimachus men, and those that inuaded them.}"
73,4,42,"{\cf2 Whereby many of them were wounded, some were slaine, and all the other chased away: but the wicked Churchrobber himselfe, they killed be sides the treasurie.}"
73,4,43,"{\cf2 For these causes an accusation was laide against Menelaus.}"
73,4,44,"{\cf2 And whe the king came to Tyrus, three men sent from the Senate pleaded the cause before him.}"
73,4,45,"{\cf2 But Menelaus, being now conuinced, promised to Ptolemeus the sonne of Dorimenes much money, if he would perswade the king.}"
73,4,46,"{\cf2 So Ptolemeus went to ye king into a court, where as he was to coole himselfe, and turned the kings minde.}"
73,4,47,"{\cf2 In so much that hee discharged Menelaus from the accusations (notwithstanding he was the cause of all mischiefe) and codemned those poore men to death, which if they had tolde their cause, yea, before the Scythians, they should haue beene heard as innocent.}"
73,4,48,"{\cf2 Thus were they soone punished vniustly, which followed vpon the matter for the citie, and for the people, and for the holy vessels.}"
73,4,49,"{\cf2 Wherefore they of Tyrus hated that wickednes, and ministred all things liberally for their buriall.}"
73,4,50,"{\cf2 And so through the couetousnesse of them that were in power, Menelaus remained in authoritie, increasing in malice, and declared himselfe a great traitour to the citizens.}"
73,5,1,"{\cf2 About the same time Antiochus vndertooke his second voyage into Egypt.}"
73,5,2,"{\cf2 And then were there seene throughout all the citie of Ierusalem, fourtie daies long, horsemen running in the aire, with robes of gold, & as bands of speare men,}"
73,5,3,"{\cf2 And as troupes of horsemen set in aray, incountering and coursing one against another with shaking of shields and multitude of darts, and drawing of swordes, and shooting of arrowes, and the glittering of the golden armour seene, and harnesse of all sortes.}"
73,5,4,"{\cf2 Therefore euery man praied, that those tokens might turne to good.}"
73,5,5,"{\cf2 Nowe when there was gone forth a false rumour, as though Antiochus had beene dead, Iason tooke at the least a thousand men, & came suddenly vpon the citie, and they that were vpon the wals, being put backe, and the citie at length taken,}"
73,5,6,"{\cf2 Menelaus fled into the castell, but Iason slew his owne citizens without mercie, not considering, that to haue the aduantage against his kinsemen is greatest disaduantage, but thought that hee had gotten the victorie of his enemies, and not of his owne nation.}"
73,5,7,"{\cf2 Yet hee gate not the superioritie, but at the last receiued shame for the rewarde of his treason, and went againe like a vagabounde into the countrey of the Ammonites.}"
73,5,8,"{\cf2 Finally he had this ende of his wicked conuersation, that hee was accused before Areta the king of the Arabians, and fled from citie to citie, being pursued of euery man, and hated as a forsaker of the Lawes, and was in abomination, as an enemie of his countrey and citizens, and was driuen into Egypt.}"
73,5,9,"{\cf2 Thus hee that had chased many out of their owne coutrey, perished as a banished man, after that he was gone to the Lacedemonians, thinking there to haue gotten succour by reason of kinred.}"
73,5,10,"{\cf2 And hee that had cast many out vnburied, was throwen out himselfe, no man mourning for him, nor putting him in his graue: neither was hee partaker of his fathers sepulchre.}"
73,5,11,"{\cf2 Nowe when these thinges that were done, were declared to the king, hee thought that Iudea would haue fallen from him: wherefore hee came with a furious minde out of Egypt, and tooke the citie by violence.}"
73,5,12,"{\cf2 He commaunded his men of warre also, that they should kill and not spare such as they met, and to slaie such as went into their houses.}"
73,5,13,"{\cf2 Thus was there a slaughter of yong men, and olde men, and a destruction of men & women and children, and virgins, and infants were murthered:}"
73,5,14,"{\cf2 So that within three daies were slaine fourescore thousand, & fourtie thousand taken prisoners, and there were as many solde as were slaine.}"
73,5,15,"{\cf2 Yet was hee not content with this, but durst goe into the most holy Temple of all the worlde, hauing Menelaus that traitour to the Lawes, and to his owne countrey, to be his guide,}"
73,5,16,"{\cf2 And with his wicked handes tooke the holy vessels, which other kings had giuen for the garnishing, glorie and honour of that place, and handled them with his wicked hands.}"
73,5,17,"{\cf2 So hautie in his minde was Antiochus, that he considered not, that God was not a litle wroth for the sinnes of them that dwelt in the citie, for the which such contempt came vpon that place.}"
73,5,18,"{\cf2 For if they had not beene wrapped in many sinnes, hee, assoone as he had come, had suddenly beene punished, and put backe from his presumption, as Heliodorus was, whom Seleucus the king sent to viewe the treasurie.}"
73,5,19,"{\cf2 But God hath not chosen the nation for the places sake, but the place for the nations sake.}"
73,5,20,"{\cf2 And therefore is the place become partaker of the peoples trouble, but afterward shal it be partaker of the benefites of the Lord, and as it is nowe forsaken in the wrath of the Almightie, so when the great Lord shalbe reconciled, it shalbe set vp in great worship againe.}"
73,5,21,"{\cf2 So when Antiochus had taken eighteene hundred talents out of the Temple, he gate him to Antiochia in all haste, thinking in his pride to make men saile vpon the dry land, and to walke vpon the sea: such an hie minde had he.}"
73,5,22,"{\cf2 But he left deputies to vexe the people: at Ierusalem Philip a Phrigian by birth, in maners more cruell then he that set him there:}"
73,5,23,"{\cf2 And at Garizin Andronicus, and with them Menelaus, which was more grieuous to the citizens then the other, and was despiteful against the Iewes his citizens.}"
73,5,24,"{\cf2 He sent also Apollonius a cruell prince, with an armie of two and twentie thousande, whome he commanded to slaie those that were towarde mans age, and to sell the women, and the yonger sort.}"
73,5,25,"{\cf2 So when hee came to Ierusalem, hee fained peace, and kept him still vntil the holy day of Sabbath: and then finding the Iewes keeping the feast, he commanded his men to take their weapons.}"
73,5,26,"{\cf2 And so he slew al them that were gone forth to the shewe, and running through the citie with his men armed, he murthered a great number.}"
73,5,27,"{\cf2 But Iudas Maccabeus, being as it were the tenth, fled into the wildernesse, and liued there in the mountaines with his companie among the beastes, and dwelling there, and eating grasse, least they should be partakers of the filthinesse.}"
73,6,1,"{\cf2 Not long after this, sent the king an olde man of Athens, for to compell the Iewes, to transgresse the Lawes of the fathers, and not to be gouerned by the Lawe of God,}"
73,6,2,"{\cf2 And to defile the Temple that was at Ierusalem, and to call it the Temple of Iupiter Olympius, and that of Garizin, according as they did that dwelt at that place, Iupiter, that keepeth hospitalitie.}"
73,6,3,"{\cf2 This wicked gouernment was sore and grieuous vnto the people.}"
73,6,4,"{\cf2 For the Temple was full of dissolution, and gluttonie of the Gentiles, which dallied with harlots, and had to doe with women within the circuit of the holy places, and brought in such thinges as were not lawfull.}"
73,6,5,"{\cf2 The altar also was ful of such things, as were abhominable and forbidden by the Lawe.}"
73,6,6,"{\cf2 Neither was it lawful to keepe the Sabbaths, nor to obserue their ancient feastes, nor plainely to confesse himselfe to be a Iewe.}"
73,6,7,"{\cf2 In the day of the kings birth they were grieuously compelled perforce euery moneth to banket, and when the feast of Bacchus was kept, they were constrained to goe in the procession of Bacchus with garlands of yuie.}"
73,6,8,"{\cf2 Moreouer through the councell of Ptolemeus, there went out a commaundement vnto the next cities of the heathen against the Iewes, that the like custome, and banketting should be kept.}"
73,6,9,"{\cf2 And who so would not coforme themselues to the maners of ye Gentiles, should be put to death: then might a man haue seene the present miserie.}"
73,6,10,"{\cf2 For there were two women brought foorth, that had circumcised their sonnes, whom when they had led rounde about the citie (the babes hanging at their breastes) they cast them downe headlong ouer the walles.}"
73,6,11,"{\cf2 Some that were runne togither into dennes to keepe the Sabbath day secretely, were discouered vnto Philip, and were burnt together, because that for the reuerence of the honourable day they were afraide to helpe themselues.}"
73,6,12,"{\cf2 Now I beseech those which read this boke, that they bee not discouraged for these calamities, but that they iudge these afflictions, not to be for destruction, but for a chastening of our nation.}"
73,6,13,"{\cf2 For it is a token of his great goodnesse not to suffer sinners long to cotinue, but straight waies to punish them.}"
73,6,14,"{\cf2 For the Lord doeth not long waite for vs, as for other nations, whome hee punisheth when they are come to the fulnesse of their sinnes.}"
73,6,15,"{\cf2 But thus hee dealeth with vs, that our sinnes shoulde not be heaped vp to the full, so that afterward he should punish vs.}"
73,6,16,"{\cf2 And therefore hee neuer withdraweth his mercy from vs: and though he punish with aduersitie, yet doeth he neuer forsake his people.}"
73,6,17,"{\cf2 But let this bee spoken nowe for a warning vnto vs: and nowe will we come to the declaring of the matter in fewe wordes.}"
73,6,18,"{\cf2 Eleazar then one of the principall scribes, an aged man, and of a well fauoured countenance, was constrained to open his mouth, and to eate swines flesh.}"
73,6,19,"{\cf2 But he desiring rather to die gloriously then to liue with hatred, offred himselfe willingly to the torment, and spit it out.}"
73,6,20,"{\cf2 As they ought to goe to death which suffer punishment for such thinges, as it is not lawfull to taste of for the desire to liue.}"
73,6,21,"{\cf2 But they that had the charge of this wicked banket, for that olde friendship of the man, tooke him aside priuilie, and praied him, that he woulde take such flesh, as was lawfull for him to vse, and as hee woulde prepare for himselfe, and dissemble as though hee had eaten of the things appoynted by the king, euen the flesh of the sacrifice,}"
73,6,22,"{\cf2 That in so doing he might be deliuered from death, and that for the olde friendship that was among them, he would receiue this fauour.}"
73,6,23,"{\cf2 But he began to consider discreetely, and as became his age, and the excellencie of his ancient yeres, and the honour of his graie heares, whereunto he was come, and his most honest conuersation from his childehoode, but chiefly the holy Lawe made and giuen by God: therefore hee answered consequently, and willed them straight wayes to send him to the graue.}"
73,6,24,"{\cf2 For it becommeth not our age, sayde he, to dissemble, whereby many young persons might thinke, that Eleazar being foure score yere old and ten were nowe gone to another religion,}"
73,6,25,"{\cf2 And so through mine hypocrisie (for a little time of a transitorie life) they might be deceiued by me, and I should procure malediction, and reproche to mine olde age.}"
73,6,26,"{\cf2 For though I were now deliuered from the torments of men, yet could I not escape the hande of the Almightie, neither aliue nor dead.}"
73,6,27,"{\cf2 Wherefore I will nowe change this life manfully, & wil shew my self such as mine age requireth,}"
73,6,28,"{\cf2 And so will leaue a notable example for such as be yong, to die willingly & courageously for the honourable and holy Lawes; when he had said these wordes, immediatly he went to torment.}"
73,6,29,"{\cf2 Nowe they that led him, changed the loue which they bare him before, into hatred, because of the wordes that he had spoken: for they thought it had beene a rage.}"
73,6,30,"{\cf2 And as hee was ready to giue the ghost because of the strokes, he sighed and sayde, The Lorde that hath the holy knowledge, knoweth manifestly, that whereas I might haue beene deliuered fromdeath, I am scourged and suffer these sore paynes of my body: but in my minde I suffer them gladly for his religion.}"
73,6,31,"{\cf2 Euen now after this maner ended he his life, leauing his death for an example of a noble courage, & a memoriall of vertue, not only vnto yong men, but vnto all his nation.}"
73,7,1,"{\cf2 It came to passe also, that seuen brethren, with their mother, were taken to be compelled by the King against the Lawe, to taste swines flesh, & were tormented with scourges and whippes.}"
73,7,2,"{\cf2 But one of them, which spake first, said thus, What seekest thou? and what wouldest thou know of vs? we are ready to die, rather then to transgresse the Lawes of our fathers.}"
73,7,3,"{\cf2 Then was the King angry, and commanded to heate pannes and cauldrons, which were incontinently made hote.}"
73,7,4,"{\cf2 And he commanded the tongue of him that spake first, to be cut out, and to slay him, & to cut off the vtmost partes of his body in the sight of his other brethren and his mother.}"
73,7,5,"{\cf2 Nowe when he was thus mangled in all his members, he commanded him to be brought aliue to the fire, and to frye him in the panne: and while the smoke for a long time smoked out of the panne, the other brethren with their mother, exhorted one another to die couragiously, saying in this maner,}"
73,7,6,"{\cf2 The Lord God doeth regard vs, and in deede taketh pleasure in vs, as Moyses declared in the song wherein he testified openly, saying, That God will take pleasure in his seruants.}"
73,7,7,"{\cf2 So when the first was dead after this maner, they brought the second to make him a mocking stocke: and when they had pulled the skinne with the heare ouer his head, they asked him, if he would eate, or he were punished in all the members of the body.}"
73,7,8,"{\cf2 But he answered in his owne language, and sayd, No. Wherefore he was tormented forthwith like the first.}"
73,7,9,"{\cf2 And when he was at the last breath, he sayd, Thou murtherer takest this present life from vs, but the king of the world wil rayse vs vp, which die for his Lawes, in the resurrection of euerlasting life.}"
73,7,10,"{\cf2 After him was the thirde had in derision, and when they demaunded his tongue, hee put it out incontinently, and stretched forth his handes boldely,}"
73,7,11,"{\cf2 And spake manfully, These haue I had from the heauen, but nowe for the Law of God I despise them, and trust that I shall receiue them of him againe.}"
73,7,12,"{\cf2 Insomuch that the King & they which were with him, marueiled at the yong mans courage, as at one that nothing regarded the paynes.}"
73,7,13,"{\cf2 Now when he was dead also, they vexed & tormented the fourth in like maner.}"
73,7,14,"{\cf2 And when he was now ready to die, he sayd thus, It is better that we shoulde change this which we might hope for of men, and wayte for our hope from God, that we may be raised vp againe by him: as for thee, thou shalt haue no resurrection to life.}"
73,7,15,"{\cf2 Afterward they brought the fifth also and tormented him,}"
73,7,16,"{\cf2 Who looked vpon the King, and sayd, Thou hast power among men, and though thou be a mortall man, thou doest what thou wilt: but thinke not, that God hath forsaken our nation.}"
73,7,17,"{\cf2 But abide a while, & thou shalt see his great power, how he will torment thee and thy seede.}"
73,7,18,"{\cf2 After him also they brought the sixt, who being at the poynt of death, sayde, Deceiue not thy selfe foolishly: for we suffer these things, which are worthy to be wondered at for our owne sakes, because we haue offended our God.}"
73,7,19,"{\cf2 But thinke not thou, which vndertakest to fight against God, that thou shalt be vnpunished.}"
73,7,20,"{\cf2 But the mother was marueilous aboue all other, & worthy of honourable memory: for when she sawe her seuen sonnes slaine within the space of one day, shee suffred it with a good will, because of the hope that she had in the Lord.}"
73,7,21,"{\cf2 Yea, shee exhorted euery one of them in her owne language, and being full of courage and wisdome, stirred vp her womaly affections with a manly stomacke, and sayd vnto them,}"
73,7,22,"{\cf2 I cannot tell how ye came into my wombe: for I neyther gaue you breath nor life: it is not I that set in order the members of your body,}"
73,7,23,"{\cf2 But doutles the Creator of the world, which formed the birth of man, and found out the beginning of all things, will also of his owne mercy giue you breath and life againe, as yee now regarde not your owne selues, for his Lawes sake.}"
73,7,24,"{\cf2 Now Antiochus thinking himselfe despised, & considering the iniurious wordes, while the yongest was yet aliue, he did exhort him not only with wordes, but swore also vnto him by an othe that he would make him rich and wealthy, if he would forsake the Lawes of his fathers, & that he would take him as a friend, and giue him offices.}"
73,7,25,"{\cf2 But when the yong man woulde in no case hearken vnto him, the King called his mother, and exhorted that she should counsell the yong man to saue his life.}"
73,7,26,"{\cf2 And when he had exhorted her with many wordes, shee promised him that she would counsell her sonne.}"
73,7,27,"{\cf2 So shee turned her vnto him, laughing the cruell tyrant to scorne, and spake in her owne language, O my sonne, haue pitie vpon me, that bare thee nine monethes in my wombe, and gaue thee sucke three yeeres, & nourished thee, & tooke care for thee vnto this age, and brought thee vp.}"
73,7,28,"{\cf2 I beseech thee, my sonne, looke vpo the heauen and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not, and so was mankinde made likewise.}"
73,7,29,"{\cf2 Feare not this hangman, but shewe thy selfe worthy such brethren by suffring death, that I may receiue thee in mercy with thy brethren.}"
73,7,30,"{\cf2 While she was yet speaking these words, the yong man said, Whom wayte ye for? I wil not obey the Kings commaundement: but I will obey the commandement of the Lawe that was giuen vnto our fathers by Moyses.}"
73,7,31,"{\cf2 And thou that imaginest all mischiefe against the Hebrewes, shalt not escape the hande of God.}"
73,7,32,"{\cf2 For we suffer these thinges, because of our sinnes,}"
73,7,33,"{\cf2 But though the liuing Lorde be angry with vs a litle while for our chastening & correction, yet wil he be reconciled with his owne seruants.}"
73,7,34,"{\cf2 But thou, O man without religion and most wicked of all men, lift not thy selfe vp in vayne, which art puffed vp with vncertaine hope, & liftest thine hands against the seruants of God.}"
73,7,35,"{\cf2 For thou hast not yet escaped the iudgemet of almightie God, which seeth all things.}"
73,7,36,"{\cf2 My brethren that haue suffred a litle payne, are nowe vnder the diuine couenant of euerlasting life: but thou through the iudgement of God, shalt suffer iust punishments for thy pride.}"
73,7,37,"{\cf2 Therefore I, as my brethren haue done, offer my body & life for the Lawes of our fathers, beseeching God, that he will soone be merciful vnto our nation, and that thou by torment and punishment mayst confesse, that he is the only God,}"
73,7,38,"{\cf2 And that in mee and my brethren the wrath of the almightie, which is righteously fallen vpon all our nation, may cease.}"
73,7,39,"{\cf2 Then the King being kindled with anger, raged more cruelly against him then the others, and tooke it grieuously, that he was mocked.}"
73,7,40,"{\cf2 So he also dyed holily, & put his whole trust in the Lord.}"
73,7,41,"{\cf2 Last of all after the sonnes, was the mother put to death.}"
73,7,42,"{\cf2 Let this now be ynough spoken concerning the bankets, and extreeme cruelties.}"
73,8,1,"{\cf2 Then Iudas Maccabeus, & they that were with him, went priuily into the townes, and called their kinsfolks and friends together, & tooke vnto them all such as continued in the Iewes religion, & assembled sixe thousand men.}"
73,8,2,"{\cf2 So they called vpon the Lord, that he would haue an eye vnto his people, which was vexed of euery man, and haue pitie vpon the Temple that was defiled by wicked men,}"
73,8,3,"{\cf2 And that he woulde haue compassion vpon the citie that was destroyed, and almost brought to the grounde, and that he woulde heare the voyce of the blood that cryed vnto him,}"
73,8,4,"{\cf2 And that hee woulde remember the wicked slaughter of the innocent children, & the blasphemies committed against his name, & that he would shew his hatred against the wicked.}"
73,8,5,"{\cf2 Nowe when Maccabeus had gathered this multitude, he could not be withstand by ye heathen: for the wrath of the Lord was turned into mercy.}"
73,8,6,"{\cf2 Therefore he came at vnwares, and burnt vp the townes and cities: yet he tooke the most commodious places, and slew many of the enemies.}"
73,8,7,"{\cf2 But specially he vsed the nights to make such assaults, in so much that the bruite of his manlines was spread euery where.}"
73,8,8,"{\cf2 So when Philippe sawe that this man increased by litle and litle, and that things prospered with him for the most part, hee wrote vnto Ptolemeus the gouernour of Coelosyria and Phenice, to helpe him in the kings busines.}"
73,8,9,"{\cf2 Then sent hee speedily Nicanor the sonne of Patroclus, a speciall friend of his, & gaue him of all nations of the heathen no lesse then twenty thousand men, to roote out the whole generation of the Iewes, & ioyned with him Gorgias a captaine, which in matters of warre had great experience.}"
73,8,10,"{\cf2 Nicanor ordeined also a tribute for the king of two thousand talents, which the Romans should haue, to be taken of ye Iewes that were taken prisoners.}"
73,8,11,"{\cf2 Therefore immediately he sent to the cities on the sea coast, prouoking them to bye Iewes to bee their seruantes, promising to sell foure score and ten for one talent: but he considered not the vegeace of almighty God, that should come vpo him.}"
73,8,12,"{\cf2 When Iudas then knewe of Nicanors coming, hee tolde them that were with him, of the coming of the armie.}"
73,8,13,"{\cf2 Nowe were there some of them fearefull, which trusted not vnto the righteousnesse of God, but fled away, and abode not in that place.}"
73,8,14,"{\cf2 But the other solde all that they had left, and besought the Lorde together, to deliuer them from that wicked Nicanor, which had sold them, or euer he came neere them.}"
73,8,15,"{\cf2 And though he woulde not doe it for their sakes, yet for the couenant made with their fathers, and because they called vpon his holy and glorious Name.}"
73,8,16,"{\cf2 And so Maccabeus called his men together, about sixe thousande, exhorting them not to be afrayde of their enemies, neither to feare the great multitude of the Getiles, which came against them vnrighteously, but to fight manly,}"
73,8,17,"{\cf2 Setting before their eyes the iniury that they had vniustly done to the holy place, & the crueltie done to the citie by derision, and the destruction of the orders established by their fathers.}"
73,8,18,"{\cf2 For they, sayd he, trust in their weapons and boldenesse: but our confidence is in the almightie God, which at a becke can both destroy them that come against vs, and all the world.}"
73,8,19,"{\cf2 Moreouer he admonished them of the helpe that God shewed vnto their fathers, as when there perished an hundreth and fourescore, & fiue thousand vnder Sennacherib,}"
73,8,20,"{\cf2 And of the battell that they had in Babylon against the Galatians, how they came in all to the battell eight thousand, with foure thousand Macedonians: and when the Macedonians were astonished, the eyght thousande slewe an hundreth and twentie thousande through the helpe that was giuen them from heauen, whereby they had receiued many benefites.}"
73,8,21,"{\cf2 Thus when hee had made them bolde with these wordes, & ready to die for the Lawes and the countrey, he deuided his armie into foure partes,}"
73,8,22,"{\cf2 And made his owne brethren captaines ouer the armie, to wit, Simon, and Ioseph and Ionathan, giuing ech one fifteene hundreth men.}"
73,8,23,"{\cf2 And when Eleazarus had read the holie booke, and giuen them a token of the helpe of God, Iudas which lead the forewarde, ioyned with Nicanor,}"
73,8,24,"{\cf2 And because the almighty helped them, they slewe aboue nine thousand men, and wounded and maymed the most part of Nicanors hoste, and so put all to flight,}"
73,8,25,"{\cf2 And tooke the money from those that came to bye them, and pursued them farre: but lacking time they returned.}"
73,8,26,"{\cf2 For it was the day before the Sabbath, and therefore they would no longer pursue them.}"
73,8,27,"{\cf2 So they tooke their weapons, & spoyled the enemies, and kept the Sabbath, giuing thankes and praysing the Lorde wonderfully, which had deliuered them that day, and powred vpon them the beginning of his mercie.}"
73,8,28,"{\cf2 And after the Sabbath, they distributed thespoyles to the sicke, and to the fatherlesse, and to the widowes, and deuided the residue among them selues and their children.}"
73,8,29,"{\cf2 When this was done, and they all had made a general prayer, they besought the mercifull Lorde to be reconciled at the length with his seruants.}"
73,8,30,"{\cf2 Afterwarde with one consent they fell vpon Timotheus and Bacchides, and slewe aboue twenty thousand, and wanne hie and strong holdes, and deuided great spoyles, and gaue an equall portion to the sicke, and to the fatherles, and to the widowes, and to aged persons also.}"
73,8,31,"{\cf2 Moreouer they gathered their weapons together, and laide them vp diligently in conuenient places, and brought the remnant of the spoyles to Ierusalem.}"
73,8,32,"{\cf2 They slewe also Philarches a most wicked person, which was with Timotheus, and had vexed the Iewes many wayes.}"
73,8,33,"{\cf2 And when they kept the feast of victorie in their countrey, they burnt Calistenes that had set fire vpon the holy gates, which was fled into a litle house: so he receiued a rewarde meete for his wickednesse.}"
73,8,34,"{\cf2 And that most wicked Nicanor, which had brought a thousand marchants to buy the Iewes,}"
73,8,35,"{\cf2 He was through ye helpe of the Lord brought downe of them whom he thought as nothing, in so much that he put off his glorious rayment, & fled ouerthwart the countrey like a fugitiue seruant, & came alone to Antiochia, with great dishonour through the destruction of his hoste.}"
73,8,36,"{\cf2 Thus hee that promised to pay tribute to the Romanes, by meanes of the prisoners of Ierusalem, brought newes, that the Iewes had a defender, & for this cause none coulde hurt the Iewes, because they followed the Lawes appoynted by him.}"
73,9,1,"{\cf2 At the same time, came Antiochus againe with dishonour out of the countrey of Persia.}"
73,9,2,"{\cf2 For when he came to Persepolis, and went about to robbe the Temple, and to subdue the citie, the people ranne in a rage to defende them selues with their weapons, and put them to flight, and Antiochus was put to flight by the inhabitants, and returned with shame.}"
73,9,3,"{\cf2 Nowe when he came to Ecbatane, he vnderstoode the things that had come to Nicanor, and Timotheus.}"
73,9,4,"{\cf2 And the being chased in his fume, he thought to impute to the Iewes their faute, which had put him to flight, and therefore commanded his charet man to driue continually, and to dispatch the iourney: for Gods iudgement compelled him: for hee had sayde thus in his pride, I will make Ierusalem a common burying place of the Iewes, when I come thither.}"
73,9,5,"{\cf2 But the Lorde almightie and God of Israel smote him with an incurable and inuisible plague: for assoone as he had spoken these wordes, a payne of the bowels, that was remediles, came vpon him, and sore torments of the inner parts,}"
73,9,6,"{\cf2 And that most iustly: for hee had tormented other mens bowels with diuers, and strange tormentes.}"
73,9,7,"{\cf2 Howbeit he woulde in no wise cease from his arrogancie, but swelled the more with pride, breathing our fire in his rage against the Iewes, & commaunded to hast the iourney: but it came to passe that he fell downe from the charet that ran swiftely, so that al the members of his body were bruised with the great fall.}"
73,9,8,"{\cf2 And thus hee that a litle afore thought hee might commande the floods of the sea (so proude was he beyond the condition of man) & to weigh the hie mountaines in the balance, was nowe caste on the grounde, and caried in an horselitter, declaring vnto all the manifest power of God,}"
73,9,9,"{\cf2 So that the wormes came out of the bodie of this wicked man in aboundance: and whiles hee was aliue, his flesh fell off for payne and torment, and all his armie was grieued at his smell.}"
73,9,10,"{\cf2 Thus no man coulde beare because of his stinke, him that a litle afore thought hee might reach to the starres of heauen.}"
73,9,11,"{\cf2 Then hee began to leaue off his great pride, and selfewill, when hee was plagued and came to the knowledge of himselfe by the scourge of God, and by his paine which increased euery moment.}"
73,9,12,"{\cf2 And when hee him selfe might not abide his owne stinke, hee saide these wordes, It is meete to be subiect vnto God, and that a man which is mortall, shoulde not thinke him selfe equall vnto God through pride.}"
73,9,13,"{\cf2 This wicked person praied also vnto ye Lord, who would nowe haue no mercy on him,}"
73,9,14,"{\cf2 And saide thus that he woulde set at libertie the holy citie vnto the which he made haste to destroy it, and to make it a burying place.}"
73,9,15,"{\cf2 And as touching the Iewes whome hee had iudged not worthie to be buried, but woulde haue cast them out with their children to bee deuoured of the foules and wilde beastes, he would make the all like the citizens of Athenes.}"
73,9,16,"{\cf2 And whereas he had spoyled the holy Temple afore, he would garnish it with great giftes, and increase the holy vessels, and of his owne rentes beare the charges belonging to the sacrifices.}"
73,9,17,"{\cf2 Yea, and that he would also become a Iewe himselfe, and goe thorowe all the worlde that was inhabited, and preach the power of God.}"
73,9,18,"{\cf2 But for all this his paines woulde not cease: for the iust iudgement of God was come vpon him: therfore despairing of his health, he wrote vnto the Iewes this letter vnder written, conteining the forme of a supplication.}"
73,9,19,"{\cf2 The King and Prince Antiochus vnto the Iewes his louing citizens wisheth much ioy and health and prosperitie.}"
73,9,20,"{\cf2 If ye and your children fare well, and if all thinges goe after your minde, I giue great thankes vnto God hauing hope in the heauen.}"
73,9,21,"{\cf2 Though I lie sicke, yet I am mindful of your honour, and good will for the loue I beare you: therefore when I returned from the countrey of Persia, and fell into a sore disease, I thought it necessarie to care for the common safetie of all,}"
73,9,22,"{\cf2 Not distrusting mine health, but hauing great hope to escape this sicknesse.}"
73,9,23,"{\cf2 Therefore considering that when my father led an hoste against the high countreis, he appoynted who should succeede him:}"
73,9,24,"{\cf2 That if any controuersie happened contrary to his expectation, or if that any tidings were brought that were grieuous, they in the land might know to whom the affaires were committed, that they shoulde not be troubled:}"
73,9,25,"{\cf2 Againe, when I ponder howe that the gouernours, that are borderers, and neighbours vnto my kingdome, waite for all occasions, and looke but for opportunitie, I haue ordeined that my sonne Antiochus shalbe king, whome I oft commended and committed to many of you, when I went into the hie prouinces, and haue written vnto him as followeth hereafter.}"
73,9,26,"{\cf2 Therefore, I pray you, and require you to remember the benefites that I haue done vnto you generally, and particularly, and that euery man will be faithfull vnto me and my sonne.}"
73,9,27,"{\cf2 For I trust that he will be gentle, and louing vnto you according to my minde.}"
73,9,28,"{\cf2 Thus the murtherer and blasphemer suffered most grieuously, and as he had intreated other men, so he died a miserable death in a strange coutrey among the mountaines.}"
73,9,29,"{\cf2 And Philippe that was brought vp with him, caried away his body, who fearing the sonne of Antiochus, went into Egypt to Ptolemeus Philometor.}"
73,10,1,"{\cf2 Maccabeus now and his company, through the helpe of the Lorde, wanne the Temple and the citie againe,}"
73,10,2,"{\cf2 And destroyed the altars, and chappels that the heathen had builded in the open places,}"
73,10,3,"{\cf2 And clensed the Temple, and made another altar, and burned stones, and tooke fire of them, and offered sacrifices, and incense two yeeres, and sixe moneths after, and set foorth the lampes, and the shewbread.}"
73,10,4,"{\cf2 When that was done, they fell downe flat vpon the grounde, and besought the Lorde, that they might come no more into such troubles: but if they sinned any more against him, that hee him selfe woulde chasten them with mercy, and that they might not bee deliuered to the blasphemous, and barbarous nations.}"
73,10,5,"{\cf2 Nowe vpon the same day, that the straungers polluted the Temple, on the very same day it was clensed againe, euen the fiue and twentie day of the same moneth, which is Chasleu.}"
73,10,6,"{\cf2 They kept eight dayes with gladnesse as in the feast of the Tabernacles, remembring, that not long afore they held the feast of the Tabernacles when they liued in the mountaines and dennes like beastes.}"
73,10,7,"{\cf2 And for the same cause they bare greene boughes, and faire branches and palmes, and sang Psalmes vnto him that had giuen them good successe in clensing his place.}"
73,10,8,"{\cf2 They ordeined also by a common statute and decree, that euery yeere those dayes should be kept of the whole nation of the Iewes.}"
73,10,9,"{\cf2 And this was the ende of Antiochus called Epiphanes.}"
73,10,10,"{\cf2 Nowe will we declare the actes of Antiochus Eupator, which was the sonne of this wicked man, gathering briefly the calamities of the warres, that followed.}"
73,10,11,"{\cf2 For when he had taken the kingdome, hee made one Lysias, which had bene captaine of the hoste in Phenice, and Coelosyria, ruler ouer the affaires of the realme.}"
73,10,12,"{\cf2 For Ptolemeus that was called Macron, purposed to doe iustice vnto the Iewes for the wrong, that had bene done vnto them, and went about to behaue himselfe peaceably with them.}"
73,10,13,"{\cf2 For the which cause hee was accused of his friendes before Eupator, and was called oft times traitour, because he had left Cyprus that Philometor had committed vnto him, and came to Antiochus Epiphanes: therefore seeing that hee was no more in estimation, he was discouraged, and poysoned himselfe, and died.}"
73,10,14,"{\cf2 But when Gorgias was gouernour of the same places, hee interteined strangers, and made warre oft times against the Iewes.}"
73,10,15,"{\cf2 Moreouer the Idumeans that helde the strong holdes, which were meete for their purpose, troubled the Iewes, and by receiuing them that were driuen from Ierusalem, tooke in hande to continue warre.}"
73,10,16,"{\cf2 Then they that were with Maccabeus made prayers, and besought God that he woulde be their helper, and so they fell vpon the strong holdes of the Idumeans,}"
73,10,17,"{\cf2 And assaulted them sore, that they wan the places, and slewe all that sought against them on the wall, and killed all that they met with, & slewe no lesse then twentie thousand.}"
73,10,18,"{\cf2 And because certaine (which were no lesse then nine thousand) were fled into two strong castles, hauing all maner of things conuenient to susteine the siege,}"
73,10,19,"{\cf2 Maccabeus left Simon, and Ioseph, and Zaccheus also, and those that were with them, which were inowe to besiege them, and departed to those places which were more necessarie.}"
73,10,20,"{\cf2 Nowe they that were with Simon, being led with couetousnes, were intreated for mony (through certaine of those that were in the castel) & tooke seuentie thousand drachmes, and let some of them escape.}"
73,10,21,"{\cf2 But when it was tolde Maccabeus what was done, hee called the gouernours of the people together, and accused those men, that they had solde their brethren for money, and let their enemies goe.}"
73,10,22,"{\cf2 So he slew them when they were conuict of treason, and immediately wan the two castels:}"
73,10,23,"{\cf2 And hauing good successe, as in al the warres that he tooke in hande, hee slewe in the two castels moe then twentie thousand.}"
73,10,24,"{\cf2 Nowe Timotheus whom the Iewes had ouercome afore, gathered an armie of strangers of al sorts, and brought a great troupe of horsemen out of Asia to winne Iewrie by strength.}"
73,10,25,"{\cf2 But when hee drewe neere, Maccabeus and they that were with him, turned to pray vnto God, and sprinkled earth vpon their heads, and girded their reines with sackcloth,}"
73,10,26,"{\cf2 And fell downe at the foote of the altar, and besought the Lorde to bee mercifull to them, and to bee an enemie to their enemies, and to bee an aduersarie to their aduersaries, as the Lawe declareth.}"
73,10,27,"{\cf2 So after ye prayer, they tooke their weapons, and went on further from the citie, and when they came neere to the enemies, they tooke heede to themselues.}"
73,10,28,"{\cf2 And when the morning appeared, they both ioyned together: the one part had the Lord for their refuge, and pledge of prosperitie, and noblevictorie, and the other tooke courage as a guide of the warre.}"
73,10,29,"{\cf2 But when the battel waxed strong, there appeared vnto the enemies from heauen fiue comely men vpon horses with bridles of golde, and two of them led the Iewes,}"
73,10,30,"{\cf2 And tooke Maccabeus betwixt them, and couered him on euery side with their weapons, and kept him safe, but shot dartes, and lightnings against the enemies, so that they were confounded with blindenesse, and beaten downe and full of trouble.}"
73,10,31,"{\cf2 There were slaine of foote men twentie thousande and fiue hundreth, and sixe hundreth horsemen.}"
73,10,32,"{\cf2 As for Timotheus himselfe, he fled vnto Gazara, which was called a very strong holde, wherein Chereas was captaine.}"
73,10,33,"{\cf2 But Maccabeus and his company layde siege against the fortresses with courage for foure dayes.}"
73,10,34,"{\cf2 And they that were within, trusting to the height of the place, blasphemed exceedingly, and spake horrible wordes.}"
73,10,35,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse vpon the fifth daye in the morning, twentie yong men of Maccabeus companie, whose heartes were inflamed, because of the blasphemies, came vnto the wall, and with bolde stomakes smote downe those that they met.}"
73,10,36,"{\cf2 Others also that climed vp vpon the engines of warre against them that were within, set fire vpo the towres, and burnt those blasphemers quicke with the fires that they had made, and others brake vp the gates, and receiued the rest of the armie, and tooke the citie.}"
73,10,37,"{\cf2 And hauing founde Timotheus, that was crept into a caue, they killed him, and Chereas his brother with Apollophanes.}"
73,10,38,"{\cf2 When this was done, they praysed the Lorde with psalmes, and thanksgiuing, which had done so great thinges for Israel, and giuen them the victorie.}"
73,11,1,"{\cf2 Very shortly after this, Lysias the kings steward, and a kinsman of his, which had the gouernance of the affaires, tooke sore displeasure for the things that were done.}"
73,11,2,"{\cf2 And when he had gathered about fourescore thousand, with all the horsemen, he came against the Iewes, thinking to make the citie an habitation of the Gentiles.}"
73,11,3,"{\cf2 And the temple would he haue to get money by, like the other temples of the heathen: for hee would sell the Priests office euery yeere.}"
73,11,4,"{\cf2 And thus being puffed vp in his minde, because of the great number of footemen, and thousands of horsemen, & in his fourescore Elephants,}"
73,11,5,"{\cf2 He came into Iudea, and drew neere to Bethsura, which was a castle of defence, fiue furlongs from Ierusalem, and layde sore siege vnto it.}"
73,11,6,"{\cf2 But when Maccabeus, and his companie knew that he besieged the holdes, they, and all the people made prayers with weeping, and teares before the Lord, that he would send a good Angel to deliuer Israel.}"
73,11,7,"{\cf2 And Maccabeus him selfe first of all tooke weapons, exhorting the other that they would ieoparde themselues together with him to helpe their brethren: so they went forth together with a couragious minde.}"
73,11,8,"{\cf2 And as they were there besides Ierusalem, there appeared before them vpon horsebacke a man in white cloathing, shaking his harnesse of golde.}"
73,11,9,"{\cf2 Then they praysed the mercifull God all together, and tooke heart, in so much that they were ready, not onely to fight with men, but with the most cruell beasts, and to breake downe walles of yron.}"
73,11,10,"{\cf2 Thus they marched forwarde in aray, hauing an helper from heauen: for the Lord was mercifull vnto them.}"
73,11,11,"{\cf2 And running vpon their enemies like lions, they slew eleuen thousande footemen, and sixteene hundreth horsemen, and put all the other to flight.}"
73,11,12,"{\cf2 Many of them also being wounded, escaped naked, and Lysias himselfe fled away shamefully, & so escaped,}"
73,11,13,"{\cf2 Who as he was a man of vnderstanding, cosidering what losse he had had, and knowing, that the Hebrewes could not be ouercome because the almightie God helped them, sent vnto them,}"
73,11,14,"{\cf2 And promised, that he would consent to all things which were reasonable, & perswade the king to be their friend.}"
73,11,15,"{\cf2 Maccabeus agreed to Lysias requests, hauing respect in all things to the common wealth, and whatsoeuer Maccabeus wrote vnto Lysias concerning the Iewes, the King granted it.}"
73,11,16,"{\cf2 For there were letters written vnto ye Iewes from Lysias conteining these wordes, Lysias vnto the people of the Iewes sendeth greeting.}"
73,11,17,"{\cf2 Iohn and Abessalom, which were sent from you, deliuered me the things that you demande by writing, and required mee to fulfill the things that they had declared.}"
73,11,18,"{\cf2 Therefore what things soeuer were meete to be reported to the King himselfe, I haue declared them, and he granted that that was possible.}"
73,11,19,"{\cf2 Therefore if ye behaue your selues as friends toward his affaires, hereafter also I will endeuour my selfe to do you good.}"
73,11,20,"{\cf2 As concerning these things, I haue giuen commandement to these men, and to those whom I sent vnto you, to commune with you of the same particularly.}"
73,11,21,"{\cf2 Fare ye well, the hundreth and eyght and fourtie yeere, the foure and twentieth day of the moneth Dioscorinthius.}"
73,11,22,"{\cf2 Nowe the Kinges letter conteined these words, King Antiochvs vnto his brother Lysias sendeth greeting.}"
73,11,23,"{\cf2 Since our father is translated vnto the gods, our will is, that they which are in our realme, liue quietly, that euery man may apply his owne affaires.}"
73,11,24,"{\cf2 We vnderstand also that the Iewes woulde not consent to our father, for to be brought vnto the custome of the Gentiles, but would keepe their owne maner of liuing: for the which cause they require of vs, that we would suffer them to liue after their owne Lawes.}"
73,11,25,"{\cf2 Wherefore our minde is that this nation shal be in rest, and haue determined to restore them their Temple, that they may be gouerned according to the custome of their fathers.}"
73,11,26,"{\cf2 Thou shalt doe well therefore to sende vnto them, & grant them peace, that when they are certified of our minde, they may be of good comfort, and cheerefully go about their owne affaires.}"
73,11,27,"{\cf2 And this was the Kings letter vnto the nation, King Antiochvs vnto the Elders of the Iewes, and to the rest of the Iewes, sendeth greeting.}"
73,11,28,"{\cf2 If ye fare well, we haue our desire: we are also in good health.}"
73,11,29,"{\cf2 Menelaus declared vnto vs that your desire was to returne home, and to applie your owne businesse.}"
73,11,30,"{\cf2 Wherefore, those that will depart, we giue them free libertie, vnto the thirtie day of the moneth of Panthicus,}"
73,11,31,"{\cf2 That the Iewes may vse their owne maner of liuing and lawes, like as afore, and none of them by any maner of wayes to haue harme for thinges done by ignorance.}"
73,11,32,"{\cf2 I haue sent also Menelaus to comfort you.}"
73,11,33,"{\cf2 Fare yee well: the hundreth and eyght and fourtie yeere, the fifteenth day of the moneth of Panthicus.}"
73,11,34,"{\cf2 The Romanes also sent a letter conteining these wordes, Qvintvs Memmivs & Titus Manslius ambassadours of the Romanes, vnto the people of the Iewes send greeting.}"
73,11,35,"{\cf2 The things that Lysias the Kings kinseman hath granted you, we grant the same also.}"
73,11,36,"{\cf2 But concerning that which he shall report vnto the King, send hither some with speede, when ye haue considered the matter diligently, that wee may consult thereupon as shall be best for you: for we must go vnto Antiochia.}"
73,11,37,"{\cf2 And therefore make haste and sende some men, that we may know your minde.}"
73,11,38,"{\cf2 Fare well: this hundreth and eyght and fourtie yeere, the fifteenth day of the moneth of Panthicus.}"
73,12,1,"{\cf2 When these couenantes were made, Lysias went vnto the King, and the Iewes tilled their grounde.}"
73,12,2,"{\cf2 But the gouernours of the places, as Timotheus and Apollonius the sonne of Genneus, and Ieronimus, and also Demophon, and besides them Nicanor the gouernour of Cyprus, woulde not let them liue in rest and peace.}"
73,12,3,"{\cf2 They of Ioppe also did such a vile acte: they prayed the Iewes that dwelt among them, to goe with their wiues and children into the shippes, which they had prepared as though they had ought them none euill will.}"
73,12,4,"{\cf2 And so by the common aduise of the citie, they obeyed them, and suspect nothing: but when they were gone forth into the deepe, they drowned no lesse then two hundreth of them.}"
73,12,5,"{\cf2 Nowe when Iudas knewe of this crueltie shewed against his nation, hee commanded those men that were with him, to make them readie.}"
73,12,6,"{\cf2 And hauing called vpon God the righteous Iudge, hee went foorth against the murtherers of his brethren, and set fire in the hauen by night, and burnt the shippes, and those that fled thence, he slewe.}"
73,12,7,"{\cf2 And when the citie was shut vp, hee departed as though he would come againe, and roote out all them of the citie of Ioppe.}"
73,12,8,"{\cf2 But when hee perceiued that the Iamnites were minded to doe in like maner vnto the Iewes, which dwelt among them,}"
73,12,9,"{\cf2 He came vpon the Iamnites by night, and set fire in the hauen with the nauie, so that the light of the fire was seene at Ierusalem, vpo a two hundreth and fourtie furlongs.}"
73,12,10,"{\cf2 Now whe they were gone from thence nine furlongs, in their iourney toward Timotheus, about fiue thousand men of foote and fiue hundreth horsemen of the Arabians set vpon him.}"
73,12,11,"{\cf2 So the battell was sharpe, but it prospered with Iudas through the helpe of God: the Nomades of Arabia; being ouercome, besought Iudas to make peace with them, and promised to giue him certaine cattell, and to helpe him in other things.}"
73,12,12,"{\cf2 And Iudas thinking that they shoulde in deede be profitable concerning many things, granted them peace: whereupon they shooke hands, and so they departed to their tents.}"
73,12,13,"{\cf2 Iudas also assaulted a citie called Caspis, which was strong by reason of a bridge, and fenced round about with walles, and had diuers kindes of people dwelling therein.}"
73,12,14,"{\cf2 So they that were within it, put such trust in the strength of the walles, and in store of vitailes, that they were ye slacker in their doings, reuiling the that were with Iudas, and reproching them: yea, they blasphemed and spake such wordes as were not lawfull.}"
73,12,15,"{\cf2 But Maccabeus souldiers, calling vpon the great Prince of the world (which without any instruments, or engins of warre, did cast downe the walles of Iericho, in the time of Iesus) gaue a fierce assault against the walles,}"
73,12,16,"{\cf2 And tooke the citie by the will of God, and made an exceeding great slaughter, in so much that a lake of two furlongs broade, which lay thereby, seemed to flowe with blood.}"
73,12,17,"{\cf2 Then departed they from thence, seuen hundreth and fiftie furlongs, and came to Characa vnto the Iewes, that are called Tubieni.}"
73,12,18,"{\cf2 But they founde not Timotheus therefor he was departed from thence, and had done nothing, and had left a garison in a very strong hold.}"
73,12,19,"{\cf2 But Dositheus, and Sosipater, which were captaines with Maccabeus, went foorth, and slewe those that Timotheus had left in the fortresse more then tenne thousand men.}"
73,12,20,"{\cf2 And Maccabeus prepared, and ranged his armie by bandes, and went couragiously against Timotheus, which had with him an hundreth and twentie thousand men of foote, and two thousand and fiue hundreth horsemen.}"
73,12,21,"{\cf2 When Timotheus had knowledge of Iudas coming, he sent the women, and children, and the other baggage afore vnto a fortresse called Carnion (for it was hard to besiege, and vneasie to come vnto because of the straites on all sides.)}"
73,12,22,"{\cf2 But when Iudas first band came in sight, the enemies were smitten with feare, and a trembling was among them through the presence of him that seeth all thinges, in so much that they fleeing one here, another there, were oft times hurt by their owne people, and wounded with the poyntes of their owne swordes.}"
73,12,23,"{\cf2 But Iudas was very earnest in pursuing, andslewe those wicked men yea, hee slewe thirtie thousand men of them.}"
73,12,24,"{\cf2 Timotheus also himselfe fell into the handes of Dositheus, and Sosipater, whome hee besought with much craft to let him go with his life, because he had many of the Iewes parents and the brethren of some of them, which, if they put him to death, should be despised.}"
73,12,25,"{\cf2 So when hee had assured them with many wordes, and promised that he woulde restore them without hurt, they let him goe for the health of their brethren.}"
73,12,26,"{\cf2 Then went Maccabeus toward Carnion, and Atargation, and slewe fiue and twentie thousand persons:}"
73,12,27,"{\cf2 And after that hee had chased away, and slayne them, Iudas remoued the hoste towarde Ephron a strong citie, wherein was Lysias and a great multitude of all nations, and the strong yong men kept the walles defending them mightily: there was also great preparation of engins of warre, and dartes.}"
73,12,28,"{\cf2 But when they had called vpon the Lorde, which with his power breaketh the strength of the enemies, they wanne the citie, and slewe fiue and twentie thousand of them that were within.}"
73,12,29,"{\cf2 From thence went they to Scythopolis, which lieth sixe hundreth furlonges from Ierusalem.}"
73,12,30,"{\cf2 But when the Iewes which dwelt there, testified, that the Scythopolitans delt louingly with them, and intreated the kindly in the time of their aduersitie,}"
73,12,31,"{\cf2 They gaue them thankes, desiring them to be friendly still vnto them, and so they came to Ierusalem, as the feast of the weekes approched.}"
73,12,32,"{\cf2 And after the feast called Pentecost, they went forth against Gorgias ye gouernor of Idumea:}"
73,12,33,"{\cf2 Who came out with three thousande men of foote and foure hundreth horsemen.}"
73,12,34,"{\cf2 And when they ioyned together, a fewe of the Iewes were slaine,}"
73,12,35,"{\cf2 And Dositheus one of the Baccenors, which was on horsebacke and a mighty man, tooke Gorgias, and laide holde of his garment, and drewe him by force, because he woulde haue taken the wicked man aliue: but an horseman of Thracia fell vpon him, & smote off his shoulder, so that Gorgias fled into Marisa.}"
73,12,36,"{\cf2 And when they that were with Eserin, had foughten long, and were weary, Iudas called vpon the Lord, that he would shewe him selfe to be their helper, and captaine of the fielde.}"
73,12,37,"{\cf2 And then hee began in his owne language, and sung psalmes with a loude voyce, in so much that straightwaies hee made them that were about Gorgias, to take their flight.}"
73,12,38,"{\cf2 So Iudas gathered his hoste, and came into the citie of Odolla; when the seuenth day came, they clensed them selues (as the custome was) and kept the Sabbath in the same place.}"
73,12,39,"{\cf2 And vpon the day following, as necessitie required, Iudas and his companie came to take vp the bodyes of them that were slaine, and to burie them with their kinsmen in their fathers graues.}"
73,12,40,"{\cf2 Nowe vnder the coates of euery one, that was slaine, they founde iewels that had bene consecrate to the idoles of the Iamnites, which thing is forbidden the Iewes by the Lawe. Then euery man sawe, that this was the cause wherefore they were slaine.}"
73,12,41,"{\cf2 And so euery man gaue thankes vnto the Lorde, the righteous Iudge, which had opened the things that were hid.}"
73,12,42,"{\cf2 And they gaue them selues to prayer, and besought him, that they should not, vtterly be destroyed for the fault comitted. Besides that, noble Iudas exhorted the people to keepe them selues from sinne, for so much as they sawe before their eyes the things which came to passe by the sinne of these that were slaine,}"
73,12,43,"{\cf2 And hauing made a gathering through the company, sent to Ierusalem about two thousande drachmes of siluer, to offer a sinne offering, doing very well, and honestly that he thought of the resurrection.}"
73,12,44,"{\cf2 For if he had not hoped, that they which were slaine, should rise againe, it had bene superfluous, and vaine, to pray for the dead.}"
73,12,45,"{\cf2 And therefore he perceiued, that there was great fauour laid vp for those that dyed godly. (It was an holy, and a good thought.) So he made a reconciliation for the dead, that they might be deliuered from sinne.}"
73,13,1,"{\cf2 In the hundreth, fourtie and nine yeere it was tolde Iudas, that Antiochus Eupator was comming with a great power into Iudea,}"
73,13,2,"{\cf2 And Lysias the stewarde and ruler of his affaires with him, hauing both in their armie an hundreth and ten thousande men of foote of the Grecians, and fiue thousande horsemen, and two and twentie elephants, and three hundreth charets set with hookes.}"
73,13,3,"{\cf2 Menelaus also ioyned him selfe with them, and with great deceite encouraged Antiochus, not for the sauegarde of the countrey, but because he thought to haue bene made the gouernour.}"
73,13,4,"{\cf2 But the King of Kings moued Antiochus minde against this wicked man, and Lysias infourmed the King that this man was the cause of all mischiefe, so that the King commaunded to bring him to Berea to put him vnto death, as the maner was in that place.}"
73,13,5,"{\cf2 Nowe there was in that place a towre of fiftie cubites high, full of ashes, and it had an instrument that turned rounde, and on euery side it rowled downe into the ashes.}"
73,13,6,"{\cf2 And there whosoeuer was condemned of sacriledge, or of any other grieuous crime, was cast of all men to the death.}"
73,13,7,"{\cf2 And so it came to passe that this wicked man should die such a death, and it was a most iust thing that Menelaus should want buriall,}"
73,13,8,"{\cf2 For because he had committed many sinnes by the altar, whose fire and ashes were holy: hee him selfe also dyed in the ashes.}"
73,13,9,"{\cf2 Nowe the King raged in his minde, and came to shew him selfe more cruell vnto the Iewes then his father.}"
73,13,10,"{\cf2 Which things when Iudas perceiued, he comanded the people to call vpon the Lord night & day, that if euer he had holpen them, he would now helpe the, when they should be put from their law, from their countrey and from the holy Temple:}"
73,13,11,"{\cf2 And that he would not suffer the people, which a litle afore began to recouer, to be subdued vnto the blasphemous nations.}"
73,13,12,"{\cf2 So when they had done this all together, & besought the Lorde for mercie with weeping, and fasting, and falling downe three dayes together, Iudas exhorted them to make them selues readie.}"
73,13,13,"{\cf2 And he being apart with the Elders, tooke counsell to goe foorth, afore the King brought his hoste into Iudea, and shoulde take the citie, and commit the matter to the helpe of the Lorde.}"
73,13,14,"{\cf2 So committing the charge to the Lorde of the worlde, he exhorted his souldiers to fight manfully, euen vnto death for the Lawes, the Temple, the citie, their countrey, and the common wealth, and camped by Modin.}"
73,13,15,"{\cf2 And so giuing his souldiers for a watch word, The victorie of God, he piked out the manliest yong men, & went by night into the Kings campe, and slewe of the hoste fourteene thousande men, & the greatest elephant with all that sate vpon him.}"
73,13,16,"{\cf2 Thus when they had brought a great feare, and trouble in the campe, and all things went prosperously with them, they departed.}"
73,13,17,"{\cf2 This was done in the breake of the day, because the protection of the Lorde did helpe them.}"
73,13,18,"{\cf2 Nowe when the King had tasted the malinesse of the Iewes, he went about to take the holdes by policie,}"
73,13,19,"{\cf2 And marched toward Beth-sura, which was a strong holde of the Iewes: but he was chased away, hurt and lost of his men.}"
73,13,20,"{\cf2 For Iudas had sent vnto them that were in it, such things as were necessarie.}"
73,13,21,"{\cf2 But Rhodocus which was in the Iewes hoste, disclosed the secrets to the enemies: therefore he was sought out, and when they had gotten him, they put him in prison.}"
73,13,22,"{\cf2 After this did the King commune with them that were in Beth-sura, & tooke truce with them, departed, and ioyned battel with Iudas, who ouercame him.}"
73,13,23,"{\cf2 But when he vnderstoode, that Philippe (whome he had left to be ouerseer of his businesse at Antiochia) did rebell against him, he was astonished, so that he yeelded him selfe to the Iewes, and made them an othe to doe all things that were right, and was appeased towarde them, and offered sacrifice and adorned the Temple, and shewed great gentlenesse to the place,}"
73,13,24,"{\cf2 And embraced Maccabeus, and made him captaine and gouernour from Ptolemais vnto the Gerreneans.}"
73,13,25,"{\cf2 Neuertheles, when he came to Ptolemais, the people of the citie were not content with this agreement: & because they were grieued, they would that he should breake the couenants.}"
73,13,26,"{\cf2 Then went Lysias vp into the iudgement seate, and excused the facte as well as he could, and perswaded them, and pacified them, and made them well affectioned, & came againe vnto Antiochia. This is the matter concerning the Kings iourney, and his returne.}"
73,14,1,"{\cf2 After three yeeres was Iudas enformed that Demetrius the sonne of Seleucus was come vp with a great power and nauie by the hauen of Tripolis,}"
73,14,2,"{\cf2 When he had wonne the countrey, and slaine Antiochus and his Lieutenant Lysias.}"
73,14,3,"{\cf2 Now Alcunus, which had bene the high Priest, and wilfully defiled himselfe in the time that all thinges were confounded, seeing that by no meanes he could saue himselfe, nor haue any more entrance to the holie Altar,}"
73,14,4,"{\cf2 He came to King Demetrius in the hundreth, fiftie and one yeere, presenting vnto him a crowne of golde, and a palme, and of the boughes, which were vsed solemnly in the Temple, and that day he held his tongue.}"
73,14,5,"{\cf2 But when hee had gotten opportunitie, and occasion for his rage, Demetrius called him to cousell, and asked him what deuises or counsels the Iewes leaned vnto.}"
73,14,6,"{\cf2 To the which hee answered, The Iewes that be called Asideans, whose captaine is Iudas Maccabeus, maintaine warres, and make insurrections, and will not let the Realme be in peace.}"
73,14,7,"{\cf2 Therefore I, being depriued of my fathers honour (I meane the high Priesthode) am nowe come hether,}"
73,14,8,"{\cf2 Partly, because I was well affectioned vnto the kings affaires, and secodly, because I sought the profit of mine owne citizens: for all our people, thorow their rashnes, are not a little troubled.}"
73,14,9,"{\cf2 Wherefore, O King, seeing thou knowest all these things, make prouision for the countrey, and our nation which is abused, according to thine own humanitie, that is readie to helpe all men.}"
73,14,10,"{\cf2 For as long as Iudas liueth, it is not possible that the matter should be well.}"
73,14,11,"{\cf2 When hee had spoken these wordes, other friendes also hauing euil will at Iudas, set Demetrius on fire.}"
73,14,12,"{\cf2 Who immediatly called for Nicanor, the ruler of the Elephants, and made him captaine ouer Iudea,}"
73,14,13,"{\cf2 And sent him forth, commanding him to slay Iudas, and to scatter them that were with him, & to make Alcimus high Priest of the great Temple.}"
73,14,14,"{\cf2 Then the heathen which fled out of Iudea from Iudas, came to Nicanor by flocks, thinking the harme and calamities of the Iewes to bee their welfare.}"
73,14,15,"{\cf2 Now when ye Iewes heard of Nicanors comming, and the gathering together of the heathen, they sprinkled themselues with earth, and prayed vnto him which had appoynted himselfe a people for euer, and did alwayes defende his owne portion with euident tokens.}"
73,14,16,"{\cf2 So at the commandement of the captaine, they remooued straightwayes from thence, and came to the towne of Dessan,}"
73,14,17,"{\cf2 Where Simon Iudas brother had ioyned battel with Nicanor, and was somewhat astonished through the sudden silence of the enemies.}"
73,14,18,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse Nicanor hearing the manlines of them that were with Iudas, and the bolde stomackes that they had for their countrey, durst notproue the matter with bloudsheading.}"
73,14,19,"{\cf2 Wherefore, he sent Posidonius, Theodocius, and Matthias before, to make peace.}"
73,14,20,"{\cf2 So when they had taken long aduisement thereupon, & the captaine shewed it vnto the multitude, they were agreed in one minde, and consented to the couenants.}"
73,14,21,"{\cf2 And they appointed a day when they should particularly come together: so when the day was come, they set for euery man his stoole.}"
73,14,22,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse Iudas commaunded certeine men of armes to waite in conuenient places, least there should suddenly arise any euil through the enemies: and so they communed together of the things whereupon they had agreed.}"
73,14,23,"{\cf2 Nicanor, while hee abode at Ierusalem, did none hurt, but sent away the people that were gathered together.}"
73,14,24,"{\cf2 Hee loued Iudas, and fauoured him in his heart.}"
73,14,25,"{\cf2 He prayed him also to take a wife, & to beget children: so he maried, and they liued together.}"
73,14,26,"{\cf2 But Alcimus perceiuing the loue that was betweene them, and vnderstanding the couenants that were made, came to Demetrius, and told him that Nicanor had taken strange matters in hande, and ordeined Iudas a traytour to the Realme, to be his successour.}"
73,14,27,"{\cf2 Then the King was displeased, and by the reportes of this wicked man, hee wrote to Nicanor, saying, that hee was very angry for the couenants, commanding him that hee should send Maccabeus in all haste prisoner vnto Antiochia.}"
73,14,28,"{\cf2 When these things came to Nicanor, he was astonished and sore grieued, that hee should breake the things wherein they had agreed, seeing that that man had committed no wickednesse.}"
73,14,29,"{\cf2 But because it was not commodious to him to withstand the King, hee sought craftily to accomplish it.}"
73,14,30,"{\cf2 Notwithstanding when Maccabeus perceiued that Nicanor began to be rough vnto him, and that he intreated him more rudely then hee was wont, he perceiued that such rigour came not of good, & therefore he gathered a fewe of his men, and withdrewe himselfe from Nicanor.}"
73,14,31,"{\cf2 But the other perceiuing that he was preuented by Maccabeus worthy pollicie, came into the great and holy Temple, and commaunded the Priests, which were offering their vsuall sacrifices, to deliuer him the man.}"
73,14,32,"{\cf2 And when they sware that they could not tell where the man was, whome he sought,}"
73,14,33,"{\cf2 He stretched out his right hand towarde the Temple, and made an othe in this maner, If ye will not deliuer me Iudas as a prisoner, I will make this Temple of God a plaine fielde, and will breake downe the altar, and will erect a notable Temple vnto Bacchus.}"
73,14,34,"{\cf2 After these wordes he departed: then the Priestes lift vp their handes towarde heauen, and besought him that was euer the defender of their nation, saying in this maner,}"
73,14,35,"{\cf2 Thou, O Lord of all things, which hast need of nothing, wouldest that the Teple of thine habitation shoulde be among vs.}"
73,14,36,"{\cf2 Therefore nowe, O most holy Lord, keepe this house euer vndefiled, which lately was clensed, and stoppe all the mouthes of the vnrighteous.}"
73,14,37,"{\cf2 Nowe was there accused vnto Nicanor, Razis one of the Elders of Ierusalem, a louer of the citie, and a man of very good report, which for his loue was called a father of the Iewes.}"
73,14,38,"{\cf2 For this man aforetimes when the Iewes were minded to keepe them selues vndefiled and pure, being accused to be of the religion of the Iewes, did offer to spende his body and life, with all constancie for the religion of the Iewes.}"
73,14,39,"{\cf2 So Nicanor willing to declare the hatred that he bare to the Iewes, sent about fiue hundreth men of warre to take him.}"
73,14,40,"{\cf2 For he thought by taking him to doe the Iewes much hurt.}"
73,14,41,"{\cf2 But when this companie would haue taken his castle, and woulde haue broken the gates by violence, and commaunded to bring fire to burne the gates, so that he was ready to be taken on euery side, he fell on his sworde,}"
73,14,42,"{\cf2 Willing rather to dye manfully, then to giue him selfe into the handes of wicked men, and to suffer reproch vnworthy for his noble stocke.}"
73,14,43,"{\cf2 Notwithstanding what time as he missed of his stroke for haste, and the multitude russhed in violently betweene the doores, he ranne boldly to the wall, and cast him selfe downe manfully among the multitude.}"
73,14,44,"{\cf2 Which conueyed them selues lightly away, and gaue place, so that he fell vpon his bellie.}"
73,14,45,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse while there was yet breath in him, being kindled in his minde, he rose vp, and though his blood gushed out like a fountaine, and he was very sore wounded, yet he ran thorowe the middest of the people,}"
73,14,46,"{\cf2 And gate him to the toppe of an high rock: so when his blood was vtterly gone, he tooke out his owne bowels with both his handes, and threwe them vpon the people, calling vpon the Lorde of life and spirit, that he woulde restore them againe vnto him, and thus he dyed.}"
73,15,1,"{\cf2 Nowe when Nicanor knewe that Iudas and his companie were in the countrey of Samaria, he thought with all assurance to come vpon them, vpon the Sabbath day.}"
73,15,2,"{\cf2 Neuerthelesse, the Iewes that were compelled to goe with him, said, O kill not so cruelly and barbarously, but honour and sanctifie the day, that is appointed by him that seeth all things.}"
73,15,3,"{\cf2 But this most wicked person demaunded, Is there a Lorde in heauen, that commaunded the Sabbath day to be kept?}"
73,15,4,"{\cf2 And when they said, There is a liuing Lorde, which ruleth in the heauen, who commanded the seuenth day to be kept,}"
73,15,5,"{\cf2 Then he saide, And I am mightie vpon earth to commande them for to arme them selues, and to perfourme the kings businesse. Notwithstanding, he could not accoplish his wicked enterprise.}"
73,15,6,"{\cf2 For Nicanor lifted vp with great pride, purposed to set vp a memorial of the victorie obteined of all them that were with Iudas.}"
73,15,7,"{\cf2 But Maccabeus had euer sure confidence & a perfite hope that the Lorde would helpe him,}"
73,15,8,"{\cf2 And exhorted his people not to be afraid at the coming of the heathen, but always to remember the helpe that had bene shewed vnto them from heauen, & to trust nowe also, that they should haue the victorie by the Almightie.}"
73,15,9,"{\cf2 Thus he incouraged them by the Lawe and Prophets, putting them in remembrance of the battels that they had wonne afore, and so made them more willing,}"
73,15,10,"{\cf2 And stirred vp their heartes, & shewed them also the deceitfulnesse of the heathen, & how they had broken their othes.}"
73,15,11,"{\cf2 Thus he armed euery one of them, not with the assurance of shieldes & speares, but with wholesome wordes and exhortations, and shewed them a dreame worthie to be beleeued, and reioyced them greatly.}"
73,15,12,"{\cf2 And this was his vision, He thought that he sawe Onias (which had bene the high Priest, a vertuous and a good man, reuerent in behauiour, and of sober conuersation, well spoken, and one that had bene exercised in all pointes of godlinesse from a childe) holding vp his handes towardes heauen, and praying for the whole people of the Iewes.}"
73,15,13,"{\cf2 After this there appeared vnto him another man which was aged, honourable, and of a wonderfull dignitie, and excellencie aboue him.}"
73,15,14,"{\cf2 And Onias spake, and said, This is a louer of the brethren, who prayeth much for the people, and for the holy citie, to wit, Ieremias the Prophet of God.}"
73,15,15,"{\cf2 He thought also that Ieremias helde out his right hande, and gaue vnto Iudas a sworde of gold: and as he gaue it, he spake thus,}"
73,15,16,"{\cf2 Take this holy sworde a gifte from God, wherewith thou shalt wound the aduersaries.}"
73,15,17,"{\cf2 And so being comforted by the wordes of Iudas, which were very sweete & able to stirre the vp to valiantnesse and to incourage the heartes of the yong men, they determined to pitch no campe, but couragiously to set vpon them, and manfully to assaile them, and to trie the matter hand to hand, because the citie and the Sanctuarie and the Temple were in danger.}"
73,15,18,"{\cf2 As for their wiues, and children, and brethre and kinsfolkes, they set lesse by their danger: but their greatest and principall feare was for the holy Temple.}"
73,15,19,"{\cf2 Againe they that were in the citie, were carefull for the armie that was abroad.}"
73,15,20,"{\cf2 Nowe whiles they all wayted for the tryall of the matter, and the enemies nowe mette with them, and the hoste was set in aray, and the beasts were separated into conuenient places, and the horsemen were placed in the wings,}"
73,15,21,"{\cf2 Maccabeus considering the coming of the multitude, and the diuers preparations of weapons, and the fiercenesse of the beastes, helde vp his handes toward heauen, calling vpon the Lord that doeth wonders, and that looked vpon them, knowing that the victorie commeth not by ye weapons, but that he giueth the victorie to them that are worthy, as seemeth good vnto him.}"
73,15,22,"{\cf2 Therefore in his prayer he said after this maner, O Lord, thou that diddest sende thine Angel in the time of Ezechias King of Iudea, who in the host of Sennacherib slewe an hundreth, foure score and fiue thousand,}"
73,15,23,"{\cf2 Sende nowe also thy good Angell before vs, O Lorde of heauens, for a feare and dread vnto them,}"
73,15,24,"{\cf2 And let them be discomfited by the strength of thine arme, which come against thine holy people to blaspheme. Thus with these wordes he made an ende.}"
73,15,25,"{\cf2 Then Nicanor and they that were with him, drew neere with trumpets & shoutings for ioy.}"
73,15,26,"{\cf2 But Iudas & his company praying & calling vpon God, encountered with the enemies,}"
73,15,27,"{\cf2 So that with their handes they fought, but with their hearts they prayed vnto God, and slewe no lesse then fiue and thirtie thousande men: for through the presence of God they were wonderously comforted.}"
73,15,28,"{\cf2 Now when they left off, & were turning againe with ioy, they vnderstoode that Nicanor himselfe was slaine for all his armour.}"
73,15,29,"{\cf2 Then they made a great shout & a cry, praysing the Almightie in their owne language.}"
73,15,30,"{\cf2 Therefore Iudas, which was euer the chiefe defender of his citizens both in body and minde, and which bare euer good affection towards them of his nation, commaunded to smite off Nicanors head, with his hand and shoulder, and to bring it to Ierusalem.}"
73,15,31,"{\cf2 And when he came there, he called all them of his nation, and set the Priests by the altar, and sent for them of the castel,}"
73,15,32,"{\cf2 And shewed them wicked Nicanors head, and the hand of that blasphemour which he had holden vp against the holy Temple of the Almightie with proude bragges.}"
73,15,33,"{\cf2 He caused the tongue also of wicked Nicanor to be cut in litle pieces, and to be cast vnto the foules, & that the rewardes of his madnesse should be hanged vp before the Temple.}"
73,15,34,"{\cf2 So euery man praised toward the heauen the glorious Lorde, saying, Blessed be he, that hath kept his place vndefiled.}"
73,15,35,"{\cf2 He hanged also Nicanors head vpon the hie castell, for an euident and plaine token vnto all of the helpe of God.}"
73,15,36,"{\cf2 And so they established all together by a common decree, that they would in no case suffer this day without keeping it holy:}"
73,15,37,"{\cf2 And that the feast should be the thirteenth day of the twelfth moneth, which is called Adar in the Syrians language, the day before Mardocheus day.}"
73,15,38,"{\cf2 Thus farre as concerning Nicanors matters, and from that time the Hebrues had the citie in possession; here will I also make an ende.}"
73,15,39,"{\cf2 If I haue done wel, and as the storie required, it is the thing that I desired: but if I haue spoken slenderly and barely, it is that I could.}"
73,15,40,"{\cf2 For as it is hurtfull to drinke wine alone, & then againe water: and as wine tempered with water is pleasant and delighteth the taste: so the setting out of the matter deliteth the eares of them that reade the storie; here shall be the ende.}"
